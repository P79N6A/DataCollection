       "'NEW YORK (Reuters) - Home furnishings retailer Crate and Barrel will partner with home services platform Handy to offer furniture assembly and home decor installation across the United States, joining a growing list of big box retailers seeking to win over shoppers with handyman services, a Handy spokesperson said on Monday.  Customers who dislike do-it-yourself chores will now be able to walk up to store associates at any of the 90 Crate and Barrel stores across the country and arrange for a Handy worker to come to their home between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m., any day of the week, to complete the task.  The Northbrook, Illinois-based retailer was expected to announce the partnership later on Monday. The decision is the latest example of a big box retailer responding to new online competition by offering a range of services complementing its furniture assortment.  Odd-jobs site Task Rabbit, a rival of Handy, was bought by Swedish furniture giant IKEA in September 2017. Determined to win over online shoppers, IKEA told Reuters it was expanding into interior design and looking at services such as furniture repair to gain an edge.  For now, Crate and Barrel customers will only be able to book a Handy worker while physically in the store and Handy installation is not currently available for Crate and Barrel products purchased online, a Handy spokesperson said.  Prices for the handyman services range from $59 to $199, a Handy spokesperson said. Hanging wall art, for example, costs $65. Desk assembly costs $109.  This is the first time Crate and Barrel is doing business with Handy, which also offers home services such as furniture assembly and television mounting via partnerships with retailers Walmart, Wayfair Inc and eBay Inc.  Separately, Walmart Inc on Friday debuted an online-exclusive furniture brand dubbed “MoDRN” and said in a company blog post it would launch new furniture and decor seasonally.  Over the past year, Walmart has seen a nearly 35 percent increase in visits to its home destination, with most customers spending more time on the site, according to the post.  The companies did not reveal financial terms of the partnership. '"

Beane said that no decision had been made by the Murray camp an hour before Murray announced his decision.\\r\\nBilly Beane wouldnt get too much into detail on Kyler Murray, only saying As continue to have private conversations with Murray and his team. Wouldnt comment on report of Murray attending combine, saying report didnt come from Murray or his representatives. URL\\r\\n— Martín Gallegos (@MartinJGallegos) February 11, 2019\\r\\nThat timing was … interesting.\\r\\nBeane said:\\r\\n“Things have certainly changed since the draft. A Heisman Trophy. He’s projected to be an early first-round pick … We’ve had ongoing conversations as it relates to the situation and as it relates to Kyler’s future, period. Not just with baseball but also potentially other sports. So, I don’t have any answers for you, and I probably won’t until we’ve decided on the process. All I can tell you is that it hasn’t been decided. And the conversations will continue.”\\r\\nThe former Oklahoma quarterback was a first-round pick by the Oakland A’s in 2018 but was permitted to play his final season of football in Norman. The A’s had the full expectation that he’d be back with the team. Murray just went on to put up historic numbers and played himself into a likely first-round pick in the NFL.\\r\\nIf Murray follows through with this announcement to choose a career in the NFL, he would have to pay back and forfeit his $4.6 million signing bonus to the A’s.\\r\\nKyler Murray will return $1.29 million of the $1.5 million signing bonus money the Oakland As gave him last year. He forfeits the remaining $3.16 million due March 1. The As will put him on the restricted list and retain Murrays rights, but they dont get a comp draft pick.\\r\\n— Jeff Passan (@JeffPassan) February 11, 2019\\r\\nBrian Hoyer's Amazon and ESPN+ subscriptions helped the Patriots win Super Bowl 53\\r\\nHow Bill Belichick outclassed the NFL's latest genius in Super Bowl 53\\r\\nThe Grammys need to stop bringing out athletes as presenters\",\n",
       "       'Tong Zou wasn’t a stereotypical crypto bro bent on accumulating flashy trophies such as Lamborghinis when he deposited his life savings into Quadriga CX’s digital exchange.\\r\\nThe 30-year-old software engineer, who’d been working in California for seven years, just wanted to save a few bucks on transfer fees after deciding to move to Vancouver. It proved to be a $560,000 (US$422,000) mistake.\\r\\n“It’s all my savings, so I’m just living on what little I have left and trying to start over,” Zou said in a phone interview Friday from Vancouver, where he has been living out of an AirBnB for the past month. “It pretty much took everything away from me.”\\r\\nZou is one of Quadriga’s 115,000 clients who are out of luck after the sudden death of the firm’s founder left $190 million in cryptocurrencies protected by his passwords unretrievable. The exchange has halted operations and was granted protection from creditors on Feb. 5 in Nova Scotia Supreme Court in Halifax.\\r\\nZou considers himself “one of the largest affected individual users” — according to an affidavit he filed as part of the court proceedings. He bought Bitcoin in the U.S. and transferred it over to Quadriga CX and immediately sold it for Canadian dollars, which was supposed to be deposited into his Canadian bank account. That was in October. He’s still waiting.\\r\\n“I wasn’t using it for trading — I just wanted to move my money over to my Canadian bank account,” Zou said in the interview. “What I didn’t know was that my withdrawal would be pending or incomplete and it never got deposited in my bank account. I’ve been waiting four months so far.”\\r\\n“A lot of other people are in the same situation as me,” he said.\\r\\nQuadrigas 115,000 clients are out of luck after the sudden death of the firms founder left $190 million in cryptocurrencies protected by his passwords unretrievable.Chris RURL\\r\\nThat money was going to help him settle back in Canada, after being away for years. Zou, who grew up in Orillia, Ontario, had moved to the U.S. after graduating from the University of Toronto in 2011. He spent the next seven years working as a software engineer around San Francisco at companies including BitTorrent Inc., Walmart Inc. and Spigit Inc.\\r\\n“I was going to use that money for a deposit on an apartment, but now I can’t do that anymore,” Zou said. “And now I’m currently searching for a job, so it’s kind of a bad time for me.”\\r\\nZou has been coordinating with other affected users online and through the Telegram messaging app, and turned to Bennett Jones LLP and McInnes Cooper to represent him and others in Quadriga’s creditor protection proceedings in Halifax.\\r\\n“I just got caught up in this at the wrong time, I guess.”\\r\\nOther affected customers have since come forward, filing competing submissions to be represented by other law firms including Miller Thomson LLP working with Cox & Palmer, and Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP working with Patterson Law. The matter is scheduled to be heard in Nova Scotia Supreme Court on Feb. 14.\\r\\nBloomberg.com',\n",
       "       'The factory workhorses are a barometer of the manufacturing sectors fitness. Changes in demand can ease or worsen concerns about China. The Reading, Pa., maker of batteries that power forklifts said those sales in China fell in the latest quarter after rising 10% or more earlier in the year.Weve seen a slowdown, said Michael Schmidtlein, EnerSys finance chief. Given that forklifts are a good indicator of economic activity, their general economy has slowed, and maybe far greater than the authorities are indicating.\\r\\nFourth-quarter results from U.S. companies highlight the many and varied ways that Chinas cooling economy affects American business, and, in turn, offer a glimpse of whats happening inside China. The indications are that slowing growth there is broad, if still modest. \\r\\nFor U.S. businesses, the repercussions extend well beyond slowing sales at companies with the biggest exposure to Chinas vast economy.\\r\\nCompanies like EnerSys are struggling with weaker demand from export manufacturers in China, which are pulling back amid fears that trade tensions will worsen. Retailers and other companies catering to Chinese consumers face signs of weakness among the countrys growing middle class. They are buying fewer cars, phones and are traveling less.\\r\\nSome analysts expect that Chinas slowing growth, and its effects on U.S. companies, will worsen in the first quarter. A recent business-sentiment survey from Oxford Economics found that many North American and European businesses see elevated risks of a sharp global downturn, with many citing Chinas economy and its policy response as significant risks.\\r\\nThe expectation is that Q1 is going to be brutal, said Brad Setser, former deputy assistant Treasury secretary for international economic analysis in the Obama administration, and now a senior fellow in international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations.\\r\\nChinese exports slowed in December and are likely to decelerate more sharply in the first quarter, Mr. Setser said, especially if trade tensions with the U.S. arent resolved: The question is, will the trade truce plus Chinas internal stimulus put Chinas economy back on a stable path?\\r\\nU.S. and Chinese officials will meet this week for trade negotiations ahead of a March 1 deadline. President Trump in early December delayed plans to increase tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25% from 10%, giving the two sides time to strike a comprehensive trade deal.\\r\\nThe uncertainty over the path of Chinas economy has gripped the attention of U.S. executives and Wall Street analysts. They mentioned China 225 times during investor conferences and calls for current S&P 500 companies through the first full week of Februarythe most over the same period in at least a decade, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of transcripts from FactSet.\\r\\nGeneral Motors Co.\\r\\nreported a 25% decline in the number of vehicles it sold in China in the fourth quarter compared with a year earliera grim turn in a year with a 9.8% sales drop. GMs sales shrank faster than those of the industry as a whole, which declined 20% in the fourth quarter and about 6% for the year.\\r\\nGM attributed its weaker performance largely to its lower-margin Wuling and Baojun brands in smaller Chinese cities, where a softening real-estate market has soured consumer sentiment. The companys luxury Cadillac brand, however, rose 17% last year over 2017, driven by sales in Chinas largest and most affluent cities. \\r\\nOne bright spot comes from continued spending by wealthy buyers.\\r\\nEstée Lauder Co\\r\\ns. said sales in the Asia-Pacific market, led by China and Hong Kong, rose 20% in the second half of last year. Chief executive Fabrizio Freda said in an earnings call last week that high-end beauty products are a relatively affordable luxury that younger Chinese shoppers keep buying, despite a decelerating national economy.\\r\\nJeweler\\r\\n\\ufeffTiffany & Co.,\\r\\nwhich rings up as much as 30% of its sales from Chinese consumers, said sales in China rose by more than 10% in the two-month holiday period ended Dec. 31.\\r\\nOutside China, the prospects look less cheery. Analysts say most of Tiffanys sales to Chinese consumers are from Chinese tourists shopping in Hong Kong, Europe and elsewhere. That business hasnt held up as well. Chinese tourists bought less in the Americas and in Hong Kong in the quarter that ended in late October, the company said.\\r\\nTourism sales also slipped over the holiday period, Tiffany said in a mid-January report. The company traces softened tourist sales to a stronger dollar, which raises travel and overseas shopping costs for Chinese consumers.\\r\\n Gene Ma, head of China research for the Institute of International Finance in Washington, D.C., said government rules to stem capital outflows, including tighter ATM withdrawal limits, likely depressed sales to Chinese tourists abroad, among other factors.\\r\\nChinas girth\\r\\nDespite slowing, China still posted economic growth above 6% last year, easily surpassing the U.S. and Europe.\\r\\nThe countrys 1.4 billion people and rising middle class bought nearly $52 billion worth of iPhones and other\\r\\nApple Inc.\\r\\nproducts in the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 29. Rapidly expanding megacities such as Shanghai are dotted with\\r\\nStarbucks\\r\\ncoffee shops, and new buildings ferry passengers on Otis elevators made by\\r\\nUnited Technologies Corp.\\r\\nChinas size and rapid growth in recent years, together with the expansion of American businesses within its economy, mean even a modest slowdown can be felt along supply chains that stretch world-wide.\\r\\n As more companies flagged economic weakness in China in their fourth-quarter results, investors and analysts have worked to untangle the impact on U.S. companies and economic sectors. Many companies disclose sales in Asia, and to a lesser extent in China, but exposure to the Chinese economy is much broader.\\r\\nCompanies such as\\r\\nMastercard Inc.,\\r\\nfor instance, have no direct business within Chinas domestic economy. Yet it can see the effect of slowing growth, Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga told analysts in a Jan. 31 conference call. Given the size of the Chinese economy, it does impact the global economic picture.\\r\\nAbout a third of companies in the S&P 500 generate no direct revenue from China, according to estimates by FactSet, based in part on company disclosures. Another third generate at least 3% of sales in China. About 60 of the biggest U.S. companies generate 10% or more of sales there. \\r\\nMany are technology and industrial companies that sell components to manufacturers that make products in China for export elsewhere, limiting their exposure to a slowing Chinese economy.\\r\\nEverything is built in China but it doesnt necessarily stay in China, said Christopher Rolland, a semiconductor analyst at Susquehanna International Group. Sales numbers, he added, can be an overrepresentation of true Chinese demand.\\r\\nNot all business problems in China are driven by tariffs or slower growth there.\\r\\nTupperware Brands Corp.\\r\\n, which markets its plastic food containers through a network of individual sellers, last month said revenue and profit across several of its units were below internal projections. The company, in part, blamed weakness in China. The companys shares fell 27% that day.\\r\\n Doug Lane, who runs a boutique investment research firm, said other direct sellers havent mentioned similar problems in China. When companies are reporting numbers below expectations, they tend to blame a lot of things, he said.\\r\\nTupperware said it generated more than $200 million in revenue in China in 2018, or about 10% of its sales, through 6,700 independent retail locations. It declined to comment.\\r\\nUnder pressure\\r\\nEnerSys, the Pennsylvania-based battery maker, is feeling pressure from all sides: a slowing Chinese economy, new government rules and the China-U.S. trade battle.\\r\\nThe company generates about 5% of its total sales in China and about 60% come from the Americas. But it makes some of its batteries in China, and the company competes with Chinese battery makers that sell backup power supplies.\\r\\nEnerSys said sales in Asia in its most recent quarter fell 11% from the prior quarter. A government mandate prompted one of its largest Chinese customers to use more recycled batteries. \\r\\nIn response to slowing sales, EnerSys had planned to use a Chinese factory to produce more products for export to the U.S. That idea was scrapped when the U.S. imposed tariffs on batteries imported from China. EnerSys says now it will export from its Chinese factory to other countries.\\r\\nThe cooling Chinese economy has driven down the price of raw materials, including the lead used to make batteries, but it isnt much of a silver lining. \\r\\nOur inputs are cheaper but the broad demand for our product is less, said Mr. Schmidtlein, the EnerSys finance chief.\\r\\nOther companies are benefiting from lower-priced raw materials on the one hand, and getting pinched by U.S. tariffs on the other. \\r\\nMasco Corp.\\r\\n, which makes Delta faucets and Hansgrohe shower heads, said it was poised to benefit from lower copper and zinc prices in the second half of last year. Masco also faces increased costs of about $150 million if the U.S. follows through on its threat to raise some tariffs on Chinese imports to 25% this year, the company said in its annual report filed Thursday.\\r\\nIf forklift demand is one rough gauge of economic growth, microchips are another. Consumer appetite for high-price electronics, including smartphones, has slowed. So has construction, which means fewer appliance sales. Both are bad news for semiconductor makers, whose chips span all those products. \\r\\nIs Your Business Affected by Tariffs?\\r\\nClick here to tell us how. The WSJ wants to hear from readers whose business or job is affected by tariffs.\\r\\nIndustrial and consumer end markets have been especially weak in greater China, Keith Jackson, chief executive of ON Semiconductor Corp., said.\\r\\nChinese manufacturers are cutting back orders of microchips to avoid being left with unsold goods, in case the U.S.-China trade dispute yields higher tariffs, and demand for Chinese-made goods falters.\\r\\nTheyre risk averse. Theyre not going to take any chances. Theyre not going to hold inventory, Thad Trent, the financial chief at Cypress Semiconductor Corp., said Jan. 16 at a conference. We see customers waiting at the last minute to place orders.\\r\\nChip makers link Chinas slowing growth with the U.S.-China trade fight. Trade is the problem why Chinese economy is weakening so much, said Steve Sanghi, CEO of Microchip Technology Inc., which makes microcontrollers used in electronic and industrial components.\\r\\nSome executives and analysts have said economic softness would dissipate if the trade issues were resolved. Others arent so sure.\\r\\nThere are some underlying economic and end-demand issues in China that still need to be dealt with and resolved, said John Vinh, a semiconductors analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.

       "       \"The dust-up between\\r\\nAmazon.com Inc.\\r\\n AMZN 0.21%\\r\\nfounder Jeff Bezos and National Enquirer parent American Media LLC has raised questions about the media companys connections to Saudi Arabia. American Media has had plenty of contacts with Saudi Arabia in recent years, including seeking financial backing from Saudi investors to fund acquisitions and producing a magazine celebrating the countrys new crown prince. It also sought advice last year from the U.S. Justice Department over whether the publisher should register as a foreign agent, a person familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal.\\r\\nThe issue of the ties came up last week when Mr. Bezos took to the internet to push back against what he said was an extortion attempt by the National Enquirer against him over an extramarital affair that the tabloid reported on last month featuring photos and texts. He said he launched his own probe into how the publication obtained his texts as well as its motives and wrote that the Saudi angle seems to hit a particularly sensitive nerve.\\r\\nAn attorney for American Media Chief Executive David Pecker on Sunday denied the company had engaged in extortion and said the source of the information for the coverage was not Saudi Arabia.\\r\\nDavid Pecker, the publisher of the National Enquirer, is facing accusations from Jeff Bezos involving blackmail and political favors. WSJs Jason Bellini breaks down the genesis of Pecker's recent controversies. Photo: Getty\\r\\nAdel al-Jubeir, a Saudi government official who was in Washington Friday, characterized the dispute between Mr. Bezos and American Media as a soap opera, Asked whether the kingdom played a role, he said, as far as I know: flat no.\\r\\nIn recent years, American Media sought Saudi financial backing to finance a failed effort to acquire Time magazine, Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money, the Journal reported last year. \\r\\nAmerican Media confirmed the contacts but said the only deal that has ever been discussed with Saudi investors was the expansion of the Mr. Olympia bodybuilding competition, which American Media owns, into the Middle East and North Africa.\\r\\nThe lawyer for Mr. Pecker, Elkan Abramowitz, on Sunday on ABC said American Media sought financing from the Saudis, but never obtained any.\\r\\nAmerican Media also produced a promotional magazine about Saudi Arabia. To commemorate Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salmans visit to the U.S. in March 2018, American Media published 200,000 copies of a 97-page, advertisement-free glossy magazine titled The New Kingdom, promoting the country and its young prince, then 32 years old.\\r\\nIn a sign American Media was concerned its connection to Saudi Arabia could become an issue, the company sought advice from the Justice Department last year about whether it should register as a foreign agenta status under which any organization engaged in public relations under the direction or control of a foreign government may fallaccording to a Justice Department letter to the company responding to its inquiry. The publisher wrote to the Justice Department after several news outlets wrote about the publication of the pro-Saudi magazine.\\r\\nThe Justice Department posted its response in redacted form. Although American Media isnt named in the letter, the details clearly reference the media company. \\r\\nA person familiar with the matter confirmed American Media wrote to the Justice Department after publishing the magazine celebrating Prince Mohammed. Frankly, it was done to kiss his ass when he came to visit in the hopes hed invest in the company and it didnt work, the person said of the magazine. There was nothing more to it than that.\\r\\nJustice Department officials wouldnt confirm that the redacted entity is American Media and declined to comment beyond what was in their letter.\\r\\nThe publisher gave an adviser to Saudi Arabia a draft of the magazine and followed the advisers editorial suggestions, according to the letter, which was dated July 13, 2018.\\r\\nAmerican Media said in the past that Saudi officials played no role in the production of the magazine. \\r\\nThe company told Justice Department officials in the letter that although it followed the editorial and photography suggestions of the adviser, it wasnt under any contractual obligation to do so. The publisher also told the Justice Department that it didnt receive any foreign money to produce the magazine.\\r\\nBased on those assertions, the Justice Department said the media company didnt need to register as a foreign agent, noting that conclusion could change if the facts in the matter are different in any way from those depicted in your submission.\\r\\nThe magazine, which hit U.S. newsstands just ahead of Prince Mohammeds March visit and sold for $13.99, drew attention at the time because of the close relationship that Mr. Pecker and President Trump had. The special issue, which remained on sale for three months, included a glowing editorial about Saudi Arabia by Kacy Grine, a French financial adviser who people familiar with the matter said visited Mr. Trump at the White House in July 2017 with Mr. Pecker and American Media Chief Content Officer Dylan Howard. Mr. Grine didnt respond to a request for comment.\\r\\nAsked on This Week Sunday if the magazine was published in an attempt to curry favor with Saudi Arabia, Mr. Abramowitz said it was published for journalistic reasons.\\r\\nAt the July 2017 meeting, Mr. Trump alluded to the Enquirers positive coverage of his election campaign and presidency.\\r\\nEditor man, editor man, how many more covers of the Enquirer have I been on than Arnold Schwarzenegger? Mr. Trump asked Mr. Howard, according to people familiar with the matter.\\r\\nA White House official said that Mr. Trump recalled the Oval Office meeting with Mr. Pecker and others and that he called the American Media CEO a great guy, the Journal reported last year.\\r\\nMr. Pecker has admitted buying embarrassing stories about Mr. Trump and burying them, a practice known as catch and kill. In exchange for immunity, the publisher and Mr. Pecker last year agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors investigating former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who arranged payments during the 2016 campaign to silence two women who alleged sexual encounters with Mr. Trump. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are examining whether the Enquirers dealings with Mr. Bezos violated the nonprosecution agreement, according to people familiar with the matter\\r\\nThe crown prince visited Mr. Trump at the White House during his March 2018 trip.\\r\\nSince the crown princes visit, his reputation and the relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have frayed. In October, Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi was killed at a Saudi consulate in Turkey, which the CIA has concluded was likely ordered by the crown prince. The Saudi government has contested the findings.\\r\\nThe Posts essential and unrelenting coverage of the murder of its columnist Jamal Khashoggi is undoubtedly unpopular in certain circles, Mr. Bezos wrote in his blog post Thursday.

       "       \"With their two young kids in tow, Juston and Kristen Herbert drove to a Target near their home outside Scottsdale, Arizona. It was time to get to work.\\r\\nThe Herberts were on the hunt for all of the Contigo water bottles the store had in stock, and kept the camera rolling for their 6,400 YouTube subscribers. Within minutes, an employee pulled out 32 two-packs — sold on clearance for US$5 each — from a back storage room. For two people who recently left their jobs in finance, the blue-and-black plastic bottles might as well have been made of gold. The Herberts would resell the two-packs on Amazon for US$19.95. Subtracting some taxes and fees, they’d clear US$6.16 in profit. All told, the Herbert’s 10-minute Target run earned them US$198.\\r\\nJuston, 30, and Kristen, 28, estimate they can reel in US$150,000 this year from their newest gig: retail arbitrage. The basic idea is to buy up a bunch of the same item — from water bottles to vacuums to Monopoly boards — and then resell them online for a handsome profit.\\r\\nFor some, this is just a lucrative side hustle — perhaps to climb out of debt or save up for a Disney World vacation. For others, it has become their primary way of earning a living. And beyond that, the Herberts say, this work is helping them build up US$50,000 so they can adopt a child.\\r\\n“If we’re showing that you can come up with big money for an adoption,” Kristen said, “you can come up with big money to get yourself out of a hole, credit card debt or a house payment.”\\r\\nWhile the idea to buy something cheap and sell it at a higher price is age-old, the concept of retail arbitrage has emerged in the digital age.\\r\\nIn between stops at different stores, the Herbert family often takes breaks to play in the park.Dominic Valente / \\r\\nFor The Washington Post\\r\\nChris Green wrote one of the go-to how-to books on the topic, titled “Retail Arbitrage.” And he’s helped popularize the moniker.\\r\\nThe term seems to be having a moment. In December, according to Google Trends, searches for “retail arbitrage” spiked on YouTube, where aficionados post videos of their shopping and reselling sprees. (One reseller, who has more than 52,000 YouTube subscribers, filmed his 22-hour buying binge through 17 Walmarts. He filled his trunk with 182 Monopoly games and flipped most of them in one night for US$2,500.)\\r\\nIn the early 2000s, resellers started flipping products on eBay. But Green’s guide focused on the engine behind many of these small businesses: Fulfillment By Amazon, or FBA.\\r\\nI see money everywhere. If I walk into a store, it's just like a dollar sign sitting on the shelf\\r\\nThrough FBA, people can add their own products to Amazon’s vast online catalogue. Sellers package their products and ship them to Amazon warehouses, where they are stored until an order comes in. Amazon takes it from there — pulling an item off the warehouse shelf and getting it to the customer’s door.\\r\\nGreen, who’s been dubbed the “godfather of retail arbitrage,” used to be a sales representative for Bosch Power Tools. He started reselling power tools on eBay in the early 2000s.\\r\\nThen, with the rise of Android and iPhone apps that can scan products and track down major sales, Green realized retail arbitrage could work for anyone, even those who didn’t know the inner workings of an industry.\\r\\n“I used to teach grandmas to do it,” Green said.\\r\\nFor Mike “Reezy Resells” Rezendes, retail arbitrage has been a kind of salvation. Rezendes said he grew up in a troubled household and was married with a child by 16. As a teenager, he noticed commercials for eBay on TV and started selling whatever he could rummage around the house, like his Nintendo and its games and controllers.\\r\\nNow, Rezendes, 34, has been reselling items online full-time for 14 years. His YouTube channel, “Reezy Resells,” has more than 85,000 subscribers (Rezendes calls his followers “Reezy’s ninjas.”) He runs his company with his best friend from high school and oversees a small team who buy up goods from stores like Nike, Marshalls and Ross.\\r\\nJuston Herbert fixes his daughters sandal after theyve loaded the car.Dominic Valente / \\r\\nFor The Washington Post\\r\\nLast year, the company saw US$800,000 in gross sales for about US$240,000 in profit. In January, he got more than US$8,000 in ad revenue from YouTube.\\r\\nOne day last month, Rezendes had more than 100 pairs of Nike shoes in his garage that he planned to ship to Amazon. He was working on a YouTube video breaking down how he bought 100 Nerf guns from Target.com and flipped them for US$1,500.\\r\\nRezendes, who lives in Santa Cruz, California, said retail arbitrage has kept him from having to fill a 9-to-5 desk job. But he also knows online resellers and small-business owners like him are crucial to Amazon’s model.\\r\\nAmazon “needs people like me to fill all the holes in the marketplace,” he said.\\r\\n“We’re literally flesh-and-blood robots for Amazon,” Rezendes said.\\r\\nThe retail giant hasn’t shied away from promoting its small businesses: In 2018, the number of small and medium-size businesses that passed US$1 million in sales in Amazon stores worldwide grew by 20 per cent. Third-party sales are growing at a faster rate than first-party sales online, the company said last month.\\r\\nYou’ll find Shane Myers on YouTube as the “Rise N Grind Picker” — with 15,000 YouTube subscribers.\\r\\n(Amazon) needs people like me to fill all the holes in the marketplace\\r\\nMike 'Reezy Resells' Rezendes\\r\\nThree years ago, with US$20 in his savings account, Myers started reselling thrift store merchandise on eBay. He turned to Amazon in August. By September, Myers had churned out more than US$2,000 selling used books alone. In his first three months back on retail arbitrage, he’d paid off all his credit card debt and car payments.\\r\\nMyers, 31, pays US$30 a month for an app called BrickSeek, which helps him find markdowns at big-box stores like Walmart and Target. A few weeks ago, Myers hit multiple Walmarts within a 150-mile radius and came home with 218 packages of lightbulbs. He found them on clearance for US$2 each. He marked up the price and netted US$4 to US$5 on each package.\\r\\nThe grand total: more than US$1,100 in profit.\\r\\nMyers hopes that within the next year and a half he can move to retail arbitrage full time and will have paid off his house. And he hopes he’ll never miss his daughter’s birthday again for work, like when he was clocking in at his old day job in retail.\\r\\n“I see money everywhere,” Myers said. “If I walk into a store, it’s just like a dollar sign sitting on the shelf.”\\r\\nThe Washington Post\",\n",

Because when using an Amazon app, watching Prime TV, or you\\'re on the main site via mobile device, signing out of Amazon actually isn\\'t that easy. \\r\\n Why is it hard to sign out of Amazon? Well, first of all, Amazon is trying to make things easy for you. What a pain to have to sign in every time you want to buy some socks or watch a show or listen to music! If you stay logged in, all that stuff is just a tap or click away. \\r\\n Second, it\\'s in Amazon\\'s interest to have you stay logged in — after all, a lot of that stuff that\\'s a tap or click away makes them money. The added step of the login might give pause, preventing the impulse buy. \\r\\n The good news is that the power is in your hands: once you know where to find the sign out spot on an Amazon page or app, the whole process takes mere seconds. \\r\\nHow to sign out of Amazon\\'s website\\r\\nA desktop sign-out is pretty straightforward.\\r\\n Steven JURL Insider \\r\\nAssuming you\\'re using a computer — meaning a desktop or laptop, and not a tablet or app, e.g. — then signing out of Amazon is blissfully simple. \\r\\n Move your cursor to hover over the words \"Accounts & Lists\" near the top right of the page. \\r\\n At the bottom of the drop down menu labeled \"Your Account,\" click on \"Sign Out.\" \\r\\nThat\\'s it, you\\'re out. \\r\\nHow to sign out of Amazon on a mobile browser\\r\\nSigning out differs a bit on a mobile web browser.\\r\\n Steven JURL Insider \\r\\nThe sign-out process on a mobile web browser is similarly straightforward, but differs slightly from a desktop sign-out. \\r\\n Click the three horizontal bars at the top left corner of the browser page. \\r\\n Scroll down to the \"Help & Settings\" section. \\r\\n Click \"Sign Out.\" \\r\\nHow to sign out of the Amazon app on Android or iPhone\\r\\n Signing out of Amazon\\'s app on a mobile device is a bit trickier, but only because the button with which to sign out takes a few taps to find. \\r\\n Open the app, and tap the \"Menu\" at the top left corner of the screen. \\r\\n On the menu that appears, tap \"Settings.\" \\r\\n On the next menu, tap \"Not NAME? Sign out.\" \\r\\nAnd... you\\'re out. \\r\\nHow to sign out of the Amazon app on iPad\\r\\n Getting signed out of Amazon on an iPad is similar to Android and iPhone, but it starts slightly differently. \\r\\n From the app\\'s main screen, tap \"Hello NAME.\" \\r\\n Then, tap \"Sign out.\" \\r\\nNow you know — protect your account by taking the few seconds to sign out of Amazon.',\n",
       "       \"IT IS a story even a supermarket tabloid could not make up. The worlds richest man, Amazon boss Jeff Bezos, has accused David Pecker, who runs the National Enquirer and other tabloids, of trying to blackmail him over intimate photographs of Mr Bezos and his mistress. Mr Pecker is a close friend of President Donald Trump.\\r\\nThe lurid saga began on January 9th when the Enquirer said that it would publish an exposé\\xa0of Mr Bezoss extramarital affair, which included racy text messages. The report hit news-stands days later. Mr Bezos then hired investigators to look into the source of the leaks regarding his private life. On February 7th he struck back with a long post on Medium, a publishing website. In it he accused the National Enquirer of blackmail, claiming that it had threatened to make public photographs of him unless he agreed to drop his dispute with the Enquirer.\\r\\nGet our daily newsletterUpgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\\r\\nMr Bezos made a point of mentioning Mr Peckers reported business ties to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, whose regime is accused of murdering Jamal Khashoggi, a columnist for the Washington Post, which Mr Bezos owns. Mr Bezos wove a web of intrigue over roughly 1,000 words that enveloped the White House, the Saudi royal family, federal prosecutors, Amazon, one of the countrys most venerable newspapers and perhaps its least venerable, the Enquirer. And, at the centre of it all, Mr Bezos himself.\\r\\nIt will take time for investigators to untangle precisely who did what and why, and whether crimes were committed. On February 10th the Daily Beast reported that the leak inquiry looked into whether Michael Sanchez, the brother of Lauren Sanchez, Mr Bezoss mistress, might have leaked the couples texts to the Enquirerand that Mr Sanchez believed the Enquirer pursued the story with President Trumps knowledge and appreciation. (Mr Sanchez has denied leaking the texts, according to media reports in America.) Mr Trump tweeted in mock sympathy for Jeff Bozo after the Enquirer first published its expose of the affair.\\r\\nFederal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York are reportedly examining whether American Media Inc (AMI), publisher of the Enquirer, broke the terms of an immunity and co-operation deal entered into in September, in connection with the prosecution of Michael Cohen, Mr Trumps former lawyer, for payments made by him on Mr Trumps behalf to aid his election. AMI admitted to helping Mr Trumps election effort in part by paying an alleged mistress of Mr Trump $150,000 for her story in order to bury it, a practice known as catch and kill. As part of the immunity deal, AMI pledged not to engage in criminal activity for at least three years.\\r\\nOn February 10th an attorney for AMI told ABC News that the company did nothing illegal, that the Enquirer merely reported on Mr Bezoss extramarital affair, and then conducted negotiations with Mr Bezos, in which both sides wanted something. (According to the e-mails Mr Bezos published, AMI wanted Mr Bezos to say that AMI was not politically motivated in its reporting on his affair). A lawyer experienced in tabloid litigation says that the case presents a murky legal question, in part because it is so unusual: Normally, someone says, Pay me money, or I will publish photos. This is a bit of a different situation. Laws and their interpretation can vary from state to state as well. Under Federal law, a threat can count as extortion if it seeks to extract something of value.\\r\\nBeyond its legal implications, the story holds foreboding lessons about the nature of power in the modern world. The first is about its fragility when privacy is increasingly at risk. In tabloid high jinks of yesteryear, a private eye might hope to get a snapshot outside a celebritys bungalow, but he could not hope to get a dick pic. Mr Bezos was able to stare down Mr Pecker, his alleged antagonist. But who else in powerful positions might feel more vulnerable to pressure? What cases of successful blackmail might the public never learn about?\\r\\nThe second lesson compounds the worries presented by the first: power is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few global titans. Mr Bezos is a prime example, with his control of a technology platform that has become a formidable player in every space it operates, and which, via Amazon Web Services, provides cloud infrastructure for many of the worlds businesses. Even AMI appears to be an Amazon cloud client.\\r\\nCritics of Mr Trump have fretted that he could be unduly influenced by the likes of Russia or Saudi Arabia, where his family has had business dealings, or that he could be the victim of kompromat held by Vladimir Putin. But the concentration of technological and market power threatens to turn people like Mr Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg into potential single points of failure that could be as worrying. A successful attempt at blackmail of Mr Bezos in a decade, when, say, Amazons Alexa devices are more widespread, would give the blackmailer a powerful media platform.\\r\\nThe irony is that the media platform that allegedly held the power in this affair, the Enquirer, would seem all but crumbling. Its print circulation has fallen precipitously from 2.6m in 1996 to 218,000 at the end of 2018, according to the Alliance for Audited Media. Its parent company, AMI, lost $138m from 2013 to 2015 and reported a profit of $17m in the fiscal year ending March 31 2016, while holding $394m in debt, according to a securities filing. In January the company managed to refinance its debt, raising $460m, after reportedly having difficulty doing so.\\r\\nA British media executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, wonders whether any of the financing could have come from Saudi Arabia, which under Prince Muhammad bin Salman, the crown prince, has shown interest in Western media investments. In 2018 Mr Pecker reportedly sought backing from Saudi investors to make a bid for Time magazine. Last year AMI also published a glossy propaganda magazine extolling the virtues of Saudi Arabia under the princes leadership. But in announcing its latest refinancing, AMI did not disclose to whom it owes its most recent debts. Another mystery in a very 21st-century American drama.\",\n",

       "       'A measles outbreak is spreading across a Washington county known for choosing not to vaccinate its children, and health officials have declared a public health emergency.\\r\\n USA TODAY\\r\\nBy correcting one potential error, health officials in Ventura County, California,\\xa0accidentally made another and jeopardized vaccines given to thousands of people.\\r\\nCounty health officials, concerned that vaccines were getting too warm while being transported to clinics, changed their protocol in 2017. But a routine audit found that the ice packs they were using might have frozen some of the medicines and reduced their effectiveness.\\r\\nOfficials offered to re-immunize anyone who received a vaccine that was delivered in faulty packaging.\\r\\n\"There\\'s no way to tell whether or not they were ineffective, said Jason Arimura, director of pharmacy Director of Pharmacy Services\\xa0at Ventura County Medical\\xa0Center. Out of an abundance of caution, he said, we just notified everyone.\"\\r\\nThe number of patients affected: 23,000.\\r\\nIt\\'s not the\\xa0only case of vaccines feared to be ineffective reaching patients. In the past 13 months alone, 117 children at an Indian Health Service clinic in Oklahoma City received\\xa0vaccines against polio, meningococcal disease and the human papillomavirus that were refrigerated improperly.\\r\\nSimilar problems with temperature control prompted a health clinic in Indianapolis to send letters last year offering to revaccinate 1,600 people, according to local news reports.\\r\\nNow Kentucky officials say\\xa0potentially ineffective and contaminated vaccines were administered at multiple businesses across Kentucky, Ohio and Indiana.\\r\\nMore: What to know about the measles outbreak, affecting over 50 in Washington anti-vaccination hot spot\\r\\nMore: Measles outbreak grows in area with low vaccination rate, most patients unimmunized\\r\\nMore: Woman grows up to reject parents\\' anti-vaxxer belief, shares viral pic of shot record\\r\\nThe federal government sets standards on the storage of vaccines. But not all health care providers are accountable under those guidelines.\\r\\nThe federal Vaccines for Children\\xa0program, which offers these drugs at no cost to kids from low-income families, requires clinics, doctors and other providers to use state-of-the-art\\xa0equipment, such as devices that monitor temperature continuously,\\xa0and undergo annual audits. It also requires providers to report problems to federal authorities.\\r\\nMore than 44,000 doctors participate in the program, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They provide vaccines to 90 percent of the nation\\'s children.\\r\\nBut medical facilities outside of the program\\xa0 including\\xa0many pharmacies and internists with private practices have no comparable federal oversight. Protocols for storing vaccines and whether they report\\xa0cases of patients receiving ineffective drugs are left\\xa0largely up to their discretion.\\r\\nThe vaccines involved in the Ventura County recall were not part of the Vaccines for Children program.\\r\\nVaccination\\r\\n\\xa0(Photo: Sean GURL Images)\\r\\nAnalysts say most hospitals, clinics and doctors are vigilant in storing their vaccines properly. Research suggests that giving compromised vaccines to patients is not harmful.\\r\\nL.J Tan, chief strategy officer for the nonprofit vaccination advocacy group Immunization Action Coalition, said the nations vaccine stock is likely among the safest in the world.\\r\\nBut Dr. Julie Boom, a pediatrician and director of the immunization project at Texas Childrens Hospital, warned that handling these medications improperly means wasting expensive drugs, and using compromised vaccines could create a pocket of under-immunized individuals.\\r\\n\"We don\\'t want that to happen,\" she said.\\r\\nIn Ventura County, the temperature problems affected vaccines for flu shots, tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough and hepatitis B. Officials told patients who had received tuberculosis testing, and some who received penicillin to treat syphilis, that their medicines also might have been compromised.\\r\\nApproximately 1,200 had returned to be revaccinated through January, Arimura says. Revaccinating all 23,000 people would cost $1.3 million, he says.\\r\\nVaccines are extremely sensitive to temperature fluctuations. In some cases, Tan says, exposing a vaccine to the wrong environment once can effectively kill live viruses and harm proteins in the vaccines.\\r\\nGenerally, temperature problems occur during when\\xa0medicines are transported.\\r\\nWithout proper monitoring, Boom says, it\\'s nearly impossible to tell whether vaccines have been exposed to extreme temperatures.\\r\\nNurse practitioner Katherine Male prepares an influenza vaccination at the CVS Pharmacy store\\'s MinuteClinic on Oct. 4, 2018, in Miami.\\r\\n\\xa0(Photo: Joe Raedle, Getty Images)\\r\\nThe inspector general of\\xa0the Department of Health and Human Services studied\\xa0Vaccines for Children providers\\xa0in 2012.\\r\\nIn a two-week period, the inspector general found,\\xa0three-quarters of the 45\\xa0providers\\xa0sampled\\xa0exposed their vaccines to improper temperatures for at least five cumulative hours.\\r\\nIn a\\xa0separate study,\\xa0researchers at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found\\xa0that 23 percent of the vaccination errors reported to the federal surveillance system from 2000 to 2013 involved improper storage or the use of expired vaccines.\\r\\nSince these reports, the CDC put in place additional requirements for the childrens program, including recording the minimum and maximum temperature of the vaccine storage unit daily.\\r\\nDr. Paul Hunter, associate professor of family medicine and community health at the University of Wisconsin, said the federal oversight is very good.\\r\\nIn the big picture, they do it very consistently, he said.\\r\\nOutside the federal surveillance system, financial concerns can create an incentive for doctors and clinics to take special care with vaccines. One dose can cost hundreds of dollars.\\r\\nSanford Health, a South Dakota-based health care system with operations throughout the Midwest, is working to make the federal requirements the standard for vaccines among its health care providers.\\r\\nThe system started Vax Champ, a six-month training program that teaches nurses how to store and handle vaccines properly. The program requires participants to periodically take photos of their vaccine stocks and send in inventory lists for review.\\r\\nFunding for the program came from the vaccine manufacturer Sanofi Pasteur.\\r\\nAndrea Polkinghorn, immunization strategy leader for Sanford Health, says vaccine storage systems vary widely among providers. Purchasing pharmaceutical-grade storage equipment is costly, she says, and providers are in different phases of the upgrade.\\xa0\\r\\nBut when you compare that to the projected loss of vaccines, Polkinghorn said, the end is worth the means.\\r\\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

       "       \"The 2019 NFL draft needed Kyler Murray. A draft class is only as interesting as its quarterbacks, and outside of the 2018 Heisman Trophy winner, the available passers in this class are … basic.\\r\\nHow the sports world reacted to Kyler Murray choosing the NFL over MLB\\r\\nBy “basic,” I mean none of the top guys — Dwayne Haskins, Drew Lock, etc. — possess any truly special traits. Murray does, obviously. He’s got game-breaking speed and agility to go along with an arm that is capable of making throws like this…\\r\\nI would call Murray a once-in-a-generation quarterback prospect, but we just saw Lamar Jackson, the greatest running quarterback in the history of college football, so I won’t resort to such hyperbole. But while Murray is not the runner Jackson is (though it is close), he is more refined as a passer (and it’s not that close). Murray’s mechanics will need work if he’s ever going to develop into a consistently accurate passer, but he is a natural thrower who can complete passes from different arm angles — a trait shared by numerous quarterbacks with a background in baseball.\\r\\nBecause of the highlight-reel runs, some scouts and analysts may write off Murray as a scramble. And while scrambling is certainly is a major part of his game, the Oklahoma product showed he was willing to be patient in the pocket. He had to be against Big XII defenses that rushed only three defensive linemen and dropped eight defenders into coverage.\\r\\nMurray’s play style will not be the biggest issue for scouts, of course. It will be his height that gives NFL front office the most pause. Murray is listed at 5-foot-10 but even that seems generous. However tall he may be, the lack of height did not seem to be an issue for Murray, who was able to see downfield even in rapidly closing pockets.\\r\\nDespite the success of shorter quarterbacks in today’s era of wide-open offense — where skill has become more important than size and strength — some NFL teams will disregard all of the brilliant film Murray produced last season simply because he doesn’t meet their height requirement for quarterbacks and focus on the more prototypical prospects in this class.\\r\\nHaskins and Lock look more like quarterbacks\\xa0but there’s nothing special about them as players. Haskins broke all kinds of records at Ohio State but did so behind a dominant offensive line while throwing to wide-open receivers who could turn a simple screen pass into a long touchdown.\\r\\nWhen Haskins was forced to throw downfield and manage pressure in a condensed pocket, his accuracy fell off a cliff.\\r\\nLock is a better athlete than Haskins is — don’t tell Stephen A. Smith that — but he’s a reckless decision-maker whose physical ability does not make up for those lapses in judgment. The Brett FURL Mahomes mentality really only works for aliens like Favre and Mahomes.\\r\\nBuffalo’s Tyree Jackson has a special arm\\xa0but has the lowest floor of any of the top quarterback prospects in the class. Duke’s Daniel Jones is this year stock tall, white dude who gets old scouts all worked up. West Virginia’s Will Grier is the player Colin Cowherd thinks Baker Mayfield is. Boise State’s Brett Rypien could very well develop into a starter one day but will probably lead the league in interceptions if he ever does.\\r\\nThe No. 1 pick should be reserved for players with Hall-of-Fame potential. For special prospects who can carry a franchise for a decade. There is only one quarterback in this class capable of doing that, and that’s Murray.\\r\\nA lot has to break right for the 21-year-old to reach his potential. But if some team out there helps him do so, Murray will dominate the league. The same cannot be said for Haskins, Lock or any other quarterback in the 2019 draft class.\\r\\n2019 NFL Draft consensus big board: Where will Kyler Murray land?\\r\\nHow the sports world reacted to Kyler Murray choosing the NFL over MLB\\r\\nKyler Murray chose football right after A's exec Billy Beane said no decision had been made\\r\\nBrian Hoyer's Amazon and ESPN+ subscriptions helped the Patriots win Super Bowl 53\",\n",
       "       'Todays marketers are asked to leverage data and analytics while fostering ideas and innovationa challenging but rewarding juggling act.\\r\\nAs senior VP, group strategy director at IPG global brand experience agency Jack Morton, Ben Grossman works with clients in a variety of industries to develop marketing efforts that are fueled by creativity and the latest technologies. While no small task, balancing big ideas and big data comes naturally to Grossman, who had a passion for fine art and graphic design long before he set strategy for some of the worlds leading brands. Today, Grossman leads strategy across Jack Mortons clients and guides the agencys approach to business consulting, brand planning, communications architecture, and measurement.\\r\\nThis week at Deloitte University, Grossman will be speaking with up-and-coming marketing leaders about how to more effectively leverage technology. In this Q&A, he discusses how brands can better merge technology and creativity, make the most of their martech investments, and adopt an innovation mindset.\\r\\nWhen working on campaigns and experiences, how do you incorporate both the left- and right-brained sides of marketing?\\r\\nGrossman: It requires thinking differently about process, people, and performance. For process, the way we work is becoming less linear and more iterative. We now tend to approach creation, development, and execution in cycles, alternating between very expansive, creative thinkingidea generation that is as broad as possibleand more technical thinking that is focused on implementation and optimization. There is a constant push and pull. This is important, because without it, ideas and innovation could be stifled by the more technical aspects of marketing. We might, for example, start with a data-based business analysis, but then conduct wide-ranging research to understand what could motivate customers in the future. We could then cycle back to a more reductive exercise of identifying a core insight for the creative team before sending them off to generate lots of big ideas. Finally, we might then perform a more technical exercise of determining which channels and distribution strategies make sense. Every client is different, but the idea is that the back and forth leads to the best work.\\r\\nFrom a talent perspective, were increasingly looking for folks who have renaissance skill sets. They often are from unconventional backgroundsthe trained scientist who became a copywriter or the beauty blogger who ended up going into strategy. And, of course, in todays landscape were looking for people who are comfortable with data and know when to use it. Overall, we seek to create a diverse group of people who will think about the marketplace in new and unexpected ways.\\r\\nLast is performancetesting different combinations of the processes and people, and getting everything to work together for the best possible outcome. Once we feel we have methodologies and teams that are working, we invest in them and have those people work together more frequently.\\r\\nYou work with marketers in many different organizations and industries. Based on what youve seen, how do you recommend CMOs approach new technologies and platforms? How can they make more effective investments?\\r\\nMany brands are undergoing digital transformation, and they are having different degrees of success. My advice: Dont let perfection be the enemy of progress. Too many times, the teams that are responsible for the martech stackwhether led by CMOs, CIOs, or digital transformation workgroupsget carried away with their initial investment and buy or license a lot of marketing technology all at once. That can be very difficult to stand up.\\r\\nI recommend instead investing incrementally in technologies while having a long-term road map to ensure that all components will be compatible once theyre in place. To get the most out of those platforms, its also critical for organizations to spend not just on technology but also on resident subject matter expertise. Last, its important to have a business case for adopting each new technology and for the teams who will use the platform every day to understand that business case.\\r\\nWhat strategies or tactics can help foster an innovation mindset?\\r\\nInnovation happens when people think in new ways and create connections that werent there before. One effective tactic\\xa0we’ve used\\xa0is the right-brain workout. The idea is to expose people to stimuli they dont encounter every day. That could mean, for example, visiting a museum, listening to a Zen master speak, going on an architectural boat tour, or taking an improv class. We try to give people experiences that will provide a more varied palette of colors to paint with when they come back to ideate. It can be hard for everyone to get away from their daily responsibilities, so making the outings fun and giving them a name and a champion are good ways to increase participation.\\r\\nWe also appoint idea bodyguards to protect innovative ideas in their infancy. New ideas are very easy to kill, so identifying someone who is willing to defend an ideato guard it from the natural criticism it will get early onis important.\\r\\nFinally, it also can be very useful to study whats happening in other industries; a big part of my job is working across our clients to understand what best practices from one industry might be ported over to another.\\r\\nWhich technologies are exciting to you as a marketer?\\r\\nThere are several, but technologies that engage with humans using natural language, like chatbots and voice assistants, are particularly promising. I dont expect them to completely replace human interface, but there are so many service requests that can be answered much more easily and effectively by automated technology. For consumers, having the ability to type or speak a request into a phone in a conversational tone, for example, is very powerful. It could lead marketers to think more about how they can offer assistance, rather than how they can blast messages.\\r\\nSafeguarding creative ideas and advocating for new technologies requires CMOs to have strong relationships. Which stakeholder connections are important for marketers to foster?\\xa0\\xa0\\r\\nA strong relationship with the CIO is fundamental, especially as organizations seek to be responsible stewards of customer data. Second, because CMOs are increasingly expected to drive business value, close collaboration with the CEO is critical. This can help marketers ensure theyre truly aligned to business priorities.

Employees are slowly becoming free agents, which is good news for companies like Facebook.\\r\\nThe social media giant recently scooped up employees from start-up Chainspace, according to a report by Cheddar. Facebook confirmed to CNBC that it had hired a handful of employees but said it did not buy the company or its technology.\\r\\nChainspace is a crypto startup founded by PhD researchers from University College of London. Two of these founders are now listed as Facebook employees on LinkedIn. According to its website, the start-up is focused on \"giving people ownership of their personal data\" through a project called \"DECODE.\"\\r\\nIn a note to clients last week, RBC analyst Mark Mahaney highlighted blockchain as a threat to Facebook and other major tech companies. The Internet is still at the \"embryonic stages of a potential massive paradigm shift\" to computing on public blockchains, according to Mahaney. That shift \"could be a long term risk to Facebook\\'s underlying business model,\" he said.\\r\\nMahaney categorized Facebook\\'s move as an \"acqui-hire\" a popular Silicon Valley term for when a company acquires a company only to recruit its employees.\\r\\n\"On the surface, it may appear that Facebook purposefully hired the technical team related to DECODE. But we don\\'t believe this was the case,\" Mahaney said. \"Our view is that this was simply an acqui-hire to expand Facebook\\'s internal crypto team\\'s expertise.\"\\r\\nFacebook is on a growing list of tech companies testing out the blockchain space, with former PayPal executive David Marcus leading its charge. Amazon, IBM, Microsoft and J. P. Morgan are among others looking at use cases for the technology, which supporters call more transparent and more secure than existing data systems.\\r\\nBut like the internet, the best way to monetize it might not be obvious immediately. \"Acqui-hiring\" gives tech giants a way to quickly get blockchain experts that are already working together to find that use case, according to Satya Bajpai, head of blockchain and Digital Assets Investment Banking at JMP Securities.\\r\\n\"It will take some time,\" said Baijpai, who advises blockchain companies on early stage M&A. \"But as the technology matures and becomes more relevant to more customers, you\\'ll see a snowball effect with more public deals and partnerships.\"',\n",

However, the propensity of companies to use the trillions in cash they are holding has caused controversy and calls for legislators to limit the practice.\\r\\nSpecifically, Sens. Charles Schumer and Bernie Sanders recently proposed requiring companies to meet certain requirements before being allowed to do repurchases. Among the standards would be minimum employee pay of $15 an hour along with paid time off and health benefits.\\r\\nJones said he wasn\\'t sure if wanted to go that far. He said he has been speaking with Schumer, a New York Democrat, for over a year on his ideas about socially responsible investing.\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know if I want to see a legislative outcome for this,\" Jones said. \"I\\'d love to see this happen organically.\"\\r\\nBefore companies make buybacks, board members should ask whether their employees are making living wages, and should look into how much the companies are contributing to charity, he said.\\r\\nAs part of his push for more ethics in boardrooms, Jones touted the Goldman Sachs JUST US Large Cap ETF, which focuses on companies that comply with environmental, social and governance standards, or the so-called ESG investing philosophy.\\r\\nThe fund is up more than 8 percent so far in 2019, about in line with the broader stock market performance. The fund administrators rank Russell 1000 companies on how they stand regarding ESG metrics, then take the top companies and include them in the ETF. The top holdings include tech giants Amazon, Microsoft and Apple.\\r\\nJones is noted for making broad market calls and predicted the 1987 stock market crash. More recently, he warned at an investor forum in November of a \"global debt bubble\" that would be \"very challenging.\" \\r\\nIn June, he told CNBC that the stock market could go \"a lot higher at the end of the year,\" but the opposite happened.

The decision is the latest example of a big box retailer responding to new online competition by offering a range of services complementing its furniture assortment. \\r\\nOdd-jobs site Task Rabbit, a rival of Handy, was bought by Swedish furniture giant IKEA in September 2017. Determined to win over online shoppers, IKEA told Reuters it was expanding into interior design and looking at services such as furniture repair to gain an edge. \\r\\nFor now, Crate and Barrel customers will only be able to book a Handy worker while physically in the store and Handy installation is not currently available for Crate and Barrel products purchased online, a Handy spokesperson said. \\r\\nPrices for the handyman services range from $59 to $199, a Handy spokesperson said. Hanging wall art, for example, costs $65. Desk assembly costs $109. \\r\\nThis is the first time Crate and Barrel is doing business with Handy, which also offers home services such as furniture assembly and television mounting via partnerships with retailers Walmart, Wayfair Inc and eBay Inc. \\r\\nSeparately, Walmart Inc on Friday debuted an online-exclusive furniture brand dubbed “MoDRN” and said in a company blog post it would launch new furniture and decor seasonally. \\r\\nOver the past year, Walmart has seen a nearly 35 percent increase in visits to its home destination, with most customers spending more time on the site, according to the post. \\r\\nThe companies did not reveal financial terms of the partnership. \\r\\nReporting by Melissa Fares in New York; Editing by David Gregorio',\n",

Maybe it\\'s the LA smog somehow polluting the screen of my iPad— but it\\'s more likely to be general residue collecting on the screen when my iPad spends the day in my too-old backpack. \\r\\n Regardless, when I sit down to work and my iPad screen is dirty, it\\'s just distracting. At some point, I have a strong suspicion that there will be research proving that we\\'re more productive when our device screens are clean. (Up until now, no comprehensive research has been conducted on the subject, so you\\'ll have to trust my hunch on this one.) \\r\\n In hopes of becoming less distracted by a dirty screen, I try to clean my iPad screen with some regularity. However, you need to be careful when cleaning any device screen. It\\'s not something you can spray Windex on and hope for the best. That\\'s why we\\'re going to cover how to clean an iPad screen and what not to do when cleaning an iPad. \\r\\nWhat to avoid when cleaning your iPad screen\\r\\n Your iPad may seem unbreakable, but it\\'s still a fragile electronic. And that means it is easily damaged and needs to be handled with care — and without moisture. Here\\'s what you need to avoid when cleaning your iPad screen: \\r\\nUsing sprays of any kind. In fact, Apple Support advises that you \"don\\'t use aerosol sprays, solvents, or abrasives.\" Apple also reminds users of its devices to not \"get moisture into any openings\" of a device. \\r\\nLeaving your device plugged in. You\\'ll also want to make sure there aren\\'t any power cables attached to your iPad while you\\'re cleaning, according to Apple. \\r\\nUsing paper towels, hand towels, or any other abrasive cloths. If it feels like you shouldn\\'t use it on your iPad screen, trust that instinct. Apple says to \"avoid abrasive cloths, towels, paper towels, and similar items that might cause damage.\" \\r\\nHow to clean an iPad screen properly\\r\\nUsing a microfiber cleaning cloth is a great move.\\r\\n Maya Kachroo-LURL Insider \\r\\nMake sure your device is unplugged. \\r\\n Turn your iPad to \"sleep\" mode or power the iPad off entirely. \\r\\n Use a soft cloth that is entirely free of lint. A microfiber cleaning cloth that you can find on Amazon is ideal — and it\\'s $12 for a three-pack. \\r\\n With small circular motions, use the soft cloth to clean the iPad screen. \\r\\n If necessary, dampen the cloth (ever so slightly) with water. If you\\'re going to dampen the cloth, use extra caution so you don\\'t risk moisture entering the cracks of the iPad. (There are multiple sources that say a conservative amount of liquid is okay in the cleaning process. Some recommend a tiny amount of water, while others recommend cleaner solutions.) Either way, remember to not spray the liquid directly on the screen, but rather apply the liquid to the cloth before cleaning the screen with small circular motions. \\r\\n Do not use the damp cloth along the perimeter of the iPad. Only a completely dry, lint-free cloth should be used to clean the screen\\'s perimeter.',\n",

A conviction on the charges could have a crippling effect on SNC-Lavalin’s ability to work on government contracts.\\r\\nLast week, the Globe and Mail reported that Prime Minister’s Office pressured Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to strike a deal on the fraud charges with the company, which could play a key role in ambitious plans to revive aging Canada’s infrastructure.

The consequences of a conviction are too high for the company and all its stakeholders, he said.\\r\\n“Maybe these guys are toast, and there’s going to be massive layoffs and they’re going to have to sell off the company in pieces,” said Willemse.\\r\\nAlternatively, he said he thinks the company could endure a conviction and still emerge as a strong investment because it’s undervalued at its current price.\\r\\n“I don’t think people selling today are doing the math, they’re selling on sentiment not valuation,” said Willemse.\\r\\n Email: gfriedman@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GabeFriedz\",\n",
       "       'It\\'s usually not a good sign when someone stops talking about a bit of information that they frequently bragged about in the past. \\r\\n If your friends stop bragging about their dating lives, or how great things are going at work, you can probably bet that things have taken a turn for the worse. \\r\\n So much more is the case when it comes to companies. When they stop disclosing certain numbers they were all too happy to share in the past, there\\'s a good chance it\\'s because those figures no longer put them in the best light and may actually highlight the fact that something is going seriously wrong with their business. \\r\\n The tech industry of late has provided three high-profile examples of this truism. \\r\\n In recent months, Apple, Facebook, and Twitter each announced that they would no longer be reporting a key figure analysts and investors have used to track their businesses. In each case, the change not only threatens to make the company\\'s results more opaque, but it also seems to be an attempt to hide something unflattering about the firm\\'s underlying performance. \\r\\n Apple stopped reporting iPhone unit sales just before they plunged \\r\\n Apple, of course, is the most notorious case of the three. In November, it alerted investors and analysts that it would no longer report the number of iPhones or other devices it sold each quarter. \\r\\n Company-watchers had long scrutinized the figures, particularly for iPhone sales, seeing them as an important indicator of demand for Apple\\'s products, their share of their markets, and the relative success of the company\\'s business. But Luca Maestri, the company\\'s chief financial officer, said Apple\\'s competitors don\\'t disclose their unit sales figures, and he argued that the numbers aren\\'t \"necessarily representative\" of the health of its business. \\r\\nLuca Maestri, Apple\\'s chief financial officer, argued that its iPhone sales no longer indicated the health of its business.\\r\\n Apple \\r\\nApple is in new lines of business, such as its collection of services, that don\\'t depend directly on the number of devices it sells, he said. It also now offers devices at a wide range of price points, he said; the sale of a $1,000 iPhone X is obviously much more meaningful to its revenue than a $450 iPhone 7, but both would could as one unit sold. \\r\\n Investors and even some analysts immediately saw through that line of reasoning. The number of iPhones Apple sold barely grew in its 2018 fiscal year, and Apple watchers worried that the company\\'s real reason for ceasing its unit-sales reports was because it figured its iPhone sales were about to start to decline. Apple\\'s stock dropped 7% on the news. \\r\\n Those fears were soon validated. Within a couple weeks of Apple\\'s announcement, the first reports started trickling out that it was seeing weak demand for its latest phones and was already starting to cut production. Although company officials initially tried to reassure nervous investors that sales were doing just fine, CEO Tim Cook eventually had to bow to reality, publicly acknowledge that sales were poor, and warn that that would translate into disappointing financial results. \\r\\nRead this:Hey Tim Cook, there\\'s a simple solution to your iPhone sales problem\\r\\n Now analysts — working, admittedly, with much less data than they used to have — are forecasting a big drop in iPhone sales this year, and potentially further declines on into the future. \\r\\n They\\'re also refuting the notion that unit sales are no longer important to Apple\\'s business, arguing convincingly that even the revenue the company gets from its services is closely tied to the number of iPhones it sells, given that so many of those services are exclusive to Apple devices. With iPhone sales expected to decline, many are now reducing their expectations for Apple\\'s service business. \\r\\n Facebook and Twitter investors should be concerned \\r\\n The Apple experience is instructive for investors and analysts hoping to make sense of similar moves by Twitter and Facebook. Both companies announced they would no longer disclose certain numbers about their respective user bases. Each attempted to justify the move by saying other numbers were more relevant to its business now. And in each case, there\\'s good reason for investors to worry about what they\\'re hiding. \\r\\nJack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, which announced it will no longer be sharing its monthly usage numbers.\\r\\n Getty \\r\\nTake Twitter. That company announced that it will no longer be reporting its number of monthly active users. Instead, it will disclose its number of monetizable daily active users; i.e. the average number to which it can show ads each day. Company officials didn\\'t offer much of an explanation for the dropping the monthly number; Ned Segal, Twitter\\'s chief financial officer, said merely that the daily number and its growth were \"the best ways to measure our success.\" \\r\\n But like Apple with the iPhone sales figure, Twitter had good reason to mask the monthly user number — it\\'s been falling. After declining for three straight quarters, the company had 321 million monthly users in the holiday period. That was the least number of monthly users it had had since the end of 2016 and was down 4% since the first quarter. \\r\\n Not to worry, Twitter officials essentially said. Its daily user count has been growing consistently for years now. \\r\\n That may be the case, but the daily usage figure is problematic for multiple reasons. One of them is that the number is relatively small — just 126 million. At least nominally, that\\'s 48% fewer than the number who use Snapchat on a daily basis. And it\\'s less than 10% of Facebook\\'s daily user base. \\r\\n A second shortcoming is that Twitter says the number isn\\'t necessarily comparable to other companies\\' daily usage figures and isn\\'t determined by \"any standardized industry methodology.\" That makes it kind of a black box — who knows how Twitter is actually calculating it? It also means that investors can\\'t directly compare Twitter\\'s performance with those of its social-networking peers. \\r\\n Another problem with the figure is that it gives a very narrow window to view Twitter\\'s usage. It would be best to be able to use it in tandem with the monthly figure to get a sense of how well Twitter is doing growing its overall user base and convincing them to use the site more regularly. Like Apple shareholders, Twitter investors didn\\'t seem thrilled with the change. The company\\'s stock dropped nearly 10% on the day of its report, even though its results beat Wall Street\\'s expectations. \\r\\n Facebook is still reporting its usage numbers — for now \\r\\n But even Facebook plans to get into the hidden figures game. In recent quarters, company officials have been touting usage of its family of services, including not just its core Facebook app, but also Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. The point officials have been trying to make is that the number of people who interact with at least one of its services daily is significantly higher than the number that just use Facebook. Additionally, the wider number has helped illustrate the growth of Instagram in particular. \\r\\nMark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, which said it will eventually stop reporting usage of its core service and app.\\r\\n REUTERS/Leah Millis \\r\\nSoon, though, company officials plan to only release the combined usage number and to cease reporting the Facebook-only figures. Again, the reason they gave was that the wider figure is a better indication of the health of the overall company. \\r\\n \"We believe these numbers better reflect the size of our community and the fact that many people are using more than one of our services,\" Dave Wehner, Facebook\\'s chief financial officer, said on a conference call with investors. \\r\\n As with Twitter and Apple, though, Facebook has an incentive to stop reporting usage of its main app — user growth on that service has slowed markedly. In the fourth quarter, daily and monthly usage of Facebook each grew by less than 9% from the same period a year earlier. As recently as the fourth quarter of 2016, monthly usage was growing at nearly a 17% annual clip and daily usage was growing by more 18%. \\r\\n The broader figure will likely obscure that flagging performance. That\\'s a problem because even though Instagram in particular has been growing rapidly, the core Facebook service still caters to the vast majority of users and brings in the bulk of the company\\'s revenue and profit. \\r\\n So keep a close eye on companies that stop reporting certain data. What they\\'re hiding almost certainly isn\\'t good news.',\n",

In the last 45 months, she has undergone numerous surgeries, dealt with complications of C5 spinal injuries, like two bouts of pneumonia and autonomic dysreflexia (sudden onset of high blood pressure), which caused her to black out, as well as a right knee issue.\\r\\nShe continues to rehab on an outpatient basis at Spaulding Rehabilitation in Framingham, and in Florida, where she lives part of the year with her grandmother. Picard has found the warm weather very beneficial.\\r\\nThrough it all, Picard, 23, has remained determined, defiant, confident, inspiring and unwavering in her faith.\\r\\nShe has progressed from wheelchair to walker to cane to yes! walking on her own. She remains paralyzed below her right knee her lovable yellow Lab, Benny, drops her three lower-leg braces on her bed every morning but has regained a little bit of plantar flexion in her right foot.

As she went to slide head first and Fordham shortstop Allie Bradian came across to cover, both at full speed, Picard\\'s head and Bradian\\'s knee collided.\\r\\nPicard was knocked out and taken to the hospital.\\r\\n\"This is what you see in a football game, not on a softball field,\" Bradian recalled of that chilling instant.\\r\\nAfter the games, Bradian walked over to the nearby Walgreens to get Picard a card. They didn\\'t know each other, so Bradian wasn\\'t sure what to write, but she gave the card to the St. Joe\\'s coach the next day. No details of Picard\\'s condition had been made public yet.\\r\\n\"I don\\'t remember when I officially realized, \\'This is bad,\\' \" Bradian said. \"It was just sitting in my heart really heavy.\"\\r\\nTime went on, their lives went on.\\r\\nBradian, a pre-med student at Fordham, sent Picard a couple more notes and a Christmas card in 2017.\\r\\n\"Something sparked in me like, \\'Wait, this might be something God is pointing at,\\' \" Picard said.\\r\\nThey soon connected on Facebook, talked on the phone and set up a time to meet, on April 18, the three-year anniversary of the accident, at Fordham\\'s field.\\r\\n\"It was like a movie,\" Picard said. \"It was pouring rain. It was just us and we were like, \\'We\\'re really doing this.\\' \"\\r\\nThe field was covered in tarp.\\r\\n\"The first thing I said to Allie is that\\'s so symbolic,\" Picard said. \"(What happened) is dead and buried. We both started crying.\\r\\n\"She said, \\'I just have to say that I\\'m sorry,\\' \" Picard said, \"and I was like, \\'Oh, my gosh. Stop.\\' But for her, for me to forgive her, she needed that. That was healing for her.\"\\r\\n\"I did need that forgiveness from her,\" Bradian said. \"Once I got it from her, I needed to forgive myself. I know it wasn\\'t my fault, but at times life happens, you get busy and I think I just needed to forgive myself for forgetting at times. I couldn\\'t forgive myself because I just felt like I wasn\\'t living my life good enough for what had happened and what didn\\'t happen to me.\"\\r\\nHonestly, Picard said, there was nothing to forgive.\\r\\n\"All those cards and with everything she was doing,\" Picard said, \"if I could go back and tell her, \\'Hey, I\\'m probably not going to talk to you much because life is pretty crazy, but I\\'m making this full recovery for you. We\\'re going to do this.\\' If I could go back and say that, I think that would have helped her with her feelings over the years.\"\\r\\nPicard and Bradian have become close friends.\\r\\n\"God is working in our lives every day,\" said Bradian, 25, of East Greenwich, New Jersey, who was visiting Picard last Friday, \"but it takes a really strong person to forgive to such an extremity where most people would get bitter. For her not to is just amazing. We talk all the time and if we were in each other\\'s shoes we would be doing the same thing.\"\\r\\nHer meeting with Bradian and their new-found friendship is the inspiration for Picard\\'s new video series #BRINGBACKTHERIGHTSIDEDIARY.\\r\\nPicard and Bradian made the video in November and December on ballfields here and near Bradian\\'s house in New Jersey. They played catch for the first time.\\r\\nEach chapter of the diary will feature an amazing person Picard has met since the accident that has made a significant impact on her life.\\r\\nChapter 2, which is near completion, is about Meredith Koch, the first friend Picard made during her two-month stay at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston. Denna Laing, the former professional ice hockey player who suffered a spinal cord injury in the 2016 Outdoor Women\\'s Classic, and Eric LeGrand, the former Rutgers football player who was paralyzed while making a tackle in a 2010 game, are planned for future chapters.\\r\\n\"The series had been in my head,\" Picard said, \"and then becoming friends with Allie it was God saying, \\'Do it.\\' My idea for #BRINGBACKTHERIGHTSIDEDIARY is you all know my story, I broke my neck diving into a base, was paralyzed on the right side and I\\'ve been fighting ever since. Now, let me motivate you with all the other people I\\'ve met who have not only done this, but who do that and not only do that, they\\'ve introduced this and make this whole process easier.\\r\\n\"When I finished Chapter 1 and posted it,\" Picard said, taking a deep breath, \"I was like, it helps.\"\\r\\nBradian, who works as a research fellow for Rothman Orthopaedics in Pennsylvania, has applied to med school but has recently begun thinking of a different career path.\\r\\n\"I did some soul searching,\" she said. \"I think I need a more personal connection. I don\\'t know if I want to be a surgeon anymore. I don\\'t know if I want to do the fixing, the first part. I think I want to not only fix the person\\'s body but also internally and mindfully help fix them. Some of the most important parts of recovery from injuries I\\'ve had was physical therapy and Bella talks, too, about her physical therapists. Without them, she wouldn\\'t be where she is.\"\\r\\nPicard has done some public speaking in Florida, and she and Bradian would like to talk to teams and at clinics here and around the country, share their stories and perspectives and help prepare young players for the mental aspect of softball and sports.\\r\\nPicard\\'s therapists at Spaulding in Framingham are working on her neck. \"The original problem,\" she said. \"You forget. The paralysis distracts everyone from \\'this broke,\\' so that\\'s been nice. It\\'s feeling better.\"\\r\\nThe title of Chapter 2 in the diary is \"Find Your Strength,\" and Picard does, every day, courageously and resiliently, through her faith, and with the love and support of her family and friends, and those who have been an incredible part of her extraordinary journey.\\r\\n\"In the video with Meredith,\" Picard said, \"I talk about how much she helped me and she talks about how much I helped her. It\\'s been healing. I never put a period on my story.

       "       'Spending on economic-development incentives in New York increased 17% over two years to $9.9 billion in 2018, according to a report released Monday by an independent watchdog.New Yorks use of corporate tax breaks has sparked fierce debate in recent months, as some local officials and residents have pushed back against a deal Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio reached to lure\\r\\nAmazon.com Inc.\\r\\nto Queens. The company has agreed to bring 25,000 jobs to the Long Island City neighborhood, where it plans to build a campus in exchange for $3 billion in state and city tax incentives. Local criticism of the deal has prompted Amazon executives to re-evaluate the project, people familiar with the matter said last week. State tax breaks and other incentives, such as grants and capital spending, increased 28% between 2016 and 2018 to nearly $4.4 billion, according to the report by the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit civic organization. Incentives from municipal and county governments grew at a slower pace of about 9% in the same period, to about $5.6 billion.\\r\\nRiley Edwards, a research associate for the commission, said it isnt clear whether New Yorkers have gotten a good deal from corporate tax incentives. She said the state should build a public database that compiles economic-development incentive data from local, county and state programs.\\r\\nTheres not really a centralized source of information on these things, Ms. Edwards said. Instead of looking at what were spending and making sure were getting what we want to get out of it, this number just keeps increasing.\\r\\nA spokesman for Mr. Cuomo said New Yorks recent job growth shows the Democratic governors economic-development approach is working. Mr. Cuomos office will discuss with state lawmakers in coming weeks several proposals to strengthen oversight and transparency around tax breaks, including a searchable database of deals that receive state incentives, the spokesman said.\\r\\nNew York has approved state tax breaks for a variety of programs ranging from tax credits for cleaning up and redeveloping old industrial sites to incentives for film and commercial productions.\\r\\nSome of the big-ticket projects that have been approved for state economic-development spending over the last two years include Moynihan Station in Manhattan, which is part of the Penn Station revamp, and Mr. Cuomos ongoing Buffalo Billion public-private development project. More than half of the estimated $5.6 billion in local incentive spending has been concentrated in New York City, according to the report.\\r\\nIn New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, has proposed scaling back corporate tax breaks. The state awarded nearly $11 billion in incentives to companies between 1996 and February 2018, according to a recently released audit by the state comptrollers office. Lawmakers are examining corporate incentives before two of the states biggest tax-credit programs expire this summer.\\r\\nWrite to Kate King at Kate.King@wsj.com',\n",

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who has accused AMI of blackmailing him with intimate photos, has questioned whether Saudi Arabia may have been involved, a claim the kingdom denies.\\r\\nA July 2018 letter from Justice Department lawyers to AMI and posted to a government website shows that the Justice Department\\'s National Security Division ultimately told the publisher that, based on AMI\\'s own statements, it did not need to register. Under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, people or entities that work to advance a foreign country\\'s political interests in the U.S. must disclose their specific activities and register as foreign lobbyists.\\r\\n\"Taking into account the facts stated in your submission, and limiting our evaluation only to the facts stated in your submission, we find that there is no agency relationship between [U.S. corporation] and any foreign principal,\" the Justice Department wrote, referring to AMI.\\r\\nAlthough the names of the parties are redacted in the publicly released version of the letter, the timing, facts and circumstances all line up precisely with AMI\\'s unusual publication of the magazine about Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his March 2018 visit to the United States. The person familiar with Saudi Arabia\\'s lobbying efforts confirmed to NBC News that AMI and the Saudi government are the entities referred to in the letter, which was first disclosed Monday by The Wall Street Journal.\\r\\nAmerican Media Inc.

The identity of the adviser mentioned is unclear.\\r\\nAMI\\'s potential ties to Saudi Arabia are under scrutiny after Bezos, in his Medium post accusing AMI of trying to blackmail him, raised the possibility that Saudi Arabia had been involved either in giving AMI the \"intimate text messages\" or in inducing AMI to target and humiliate him. Bezos specifically raised the example of AMI\\'s pro-Saudi magazine to point out that there have long been questions about whether its reporting is influenced by \"external forces.\"\\r\\nBezos wrote that a top AMI official had recently told him and his lawyers that AMI\\'s CEO, David Pecker, was \"apoplectic\" that Bezos had launched a private investigation into how AMI got his text messages.\\r\\n\"For reasons still to be better understood, the Saudi angle seems to hit a particularly sensitive nerve,\" Bezos wrote.\\r\\nPecker, through his lawyer, has said that Saudi Arabia was not the source of the text messages obtained by The National Enquirer, though AMI has declined to identify the source.\\r\\n\"The clear threat from Bezos\\' point of view is that we\\'re going to link you to Saudi Arabia, we\\'re going to say that you hacked all of these texts, we\\'re going to slander the publication as much as we can,\" Pecker\\'s lawyer, Elkan Abramowitz, said Sunday on ABC\"s \"This Week.\"\\r\\nSaudi Arabia, too, has pushed back on the suggestion from Bezos that it was involved in leaking his emails.\\r\\n\"As far as I know, flat no,\" Saudi State Minister Adel al-Jubeir told reporters Friday at the Saudi Embassy in Washington.

       "       'The Trump administration is proposing steps aimed at improving patients access to their own health data, bolstering efforts to bring information including insurance claims, hospital and doctor records to digital devices such as smartphones.Federal health regulators unveiled two major proposed regulations closely watched by health and technology companies, amid a growing flood of health data that has become an ever-more-valuable asset. The draft rules touch on a broad array of issues, including technology standards that are supposed to help unlock digital data stored in the electronic health records used by hospitals and doctors to track patients care.The new proposals could benefit a growing list of companies including\\r\\nApple Inc.\\r\\nthat are building tools for patients to store real-time health information on their digital devices. Federal officials said they want to prod health care toward the digital norm in other industries like banking, where consumers routinely tap records on their smartphones. Today, patients are often forced to carry printouts or physical discs to a new doctors office.\\r\\nPatients have really lost in the system, said Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, one of the agencies issuing the proposed rules. Today, instead of filing cabinets and paper silos, we now have electronic silos that make it difficult for patients to access their own health data.\\r\\nOne of the new proposals says that patients must be able to electronically access all of their health information held in a health-care providers electronic record, including details such as doctors notes, and the patient cant be charged for the material. The rule really is, OK, lets figure out how to get this information out technically and lets force it out, said Don Rucker, the national coordinator for health information technology in the Department of Health and Human Services.\\r\\nToday, hospitals generally offer online patient portals, but these often lack material such as doctor notes, imaging scans and genetic-testing data. Sometimes, hospitals and doctors charge for access to records, said Deven McGraw, a former federal official who is now an executive at Ciitizen, a startup creating an online tool for patients to pull together health data. Its very hard for individuals to get their health information today, she said, despite existing law that protects such access.\\r\\nTech giants like Amazon and Apple are expanding their businesses to include electronic health records, which contain data on diagnoses, prescriptions and other medical information. Thats creating both opportunities and spurring privacy concerns. Heres what to know. Photo Composite: Heather Seidel/ The Wall Street Journal\\r\\nThe new proposals would also require health insurers offering government-backed plans such as Medicare Advantage, managed Medicaid and Affordable Care Act exchange coverage to open up new digital pathways to claims data for consumers, including information on costs of services. That could allow such data to be integrated into tools like Apples. Other companies trying to help patients access their health information include Ciitizen, Seqster and PicnicHealth, as well as\\r\\nUnitedHealth Group Inc.,\\r\\nwhich is creating an individual health record. Insurers directories of doctors and hospitals would also need to be made available in that fashion.\\r\\nMs. Verma said she would encourage insurers to offer the same service in employer plans, and that if they dont, legislation might be needed.\\r\\nHealth information long kept in paper records has been moving into the digital realm, pushed by billions of dollars in federal incentives. Now, the federal government says that at least 97% of hospitals have electronic health records, which are used to document everything from doctor visits to imaging scans.\\r\\nSuch digital information carries huge value. It can help improve patient care and convenience. But it also serves business imperatives such as keeping patients tied closely to particular hospital systems, developing valuable new artificial-intelligence-powered health-care tools, and allowing drug-industry studies of the real-world effects of medicines.\\r\\nIn 2016, after a federal report found that some health-care providers and electronic-health-records vendors had choked off the exchange of health data, Congress passed a law that included financial penalties for such information blocking. However, regulations had to be written for it to take full effect. There have been roadblocks that prevent innovations and data from being widely shared where it could benefit patients, said Julia Adler-Milstein, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco.\\r\\nThe new proposal carves out seven exceptions to the laws mandate, when a company might legitimately decline to share data. Among them: when the health-data request would impose an unreasonable burden or violate health-privacy practices. The proposal would also impose new limits on health-data holders ability to charge other companies for access. They could still impose fees to recover certain costs they incur.\\r\\nThe 2016 law also said health-information-technology vendors such as electronic-medical-record companies couldnt block others from sharing information related to their products usability and security, among other topics. The new proposal fleshes that out, allowing some narrow exceptions, but says companies cant broadly ban sharing of screenshots. Safety experts have complained that prohibitions on such shots have sometimes limited efforts to communicate about problems.\\r\\nThe new proposal also includes a requirement for hospitals to provide digital notifications about patients who are admitted, transferred or discharged. These would go to other health-care providers that see those patients. The proposal makes such reports a condition of participating in the Medicare program, a very powerful regulatory hammer.\\r\\nCurrently, doctors often arent told when their patients are in the hospital, or when patients leave it, said Farzad Mostashari, a former federal health official who is now CEO of Aledade Inc., a company that helps doctors manage groups of patients. That can lead to problems, such as patients taking drugs they shouldnt get after receiving a prescription from a hospital doctor. Those can be really, really dangerous moments, he said.\\r\\nWrite to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com',\n",
       "       'Its good news, sort of, that since the end of the recession the amount of wealth in the country owned by the poorest 150 million Americans has spiked from almost nothing to more than 2 percent. That, according to data reported by The Posts Chris Ingraham last week, means that those 160 million people now have about $2 for every $3 held by the richest 400 Americans.\\r\\nNot the richest 400 million Americans. The richest 400 Americans as individuals, who have 50 percent more of the countrys wealth than those 160 million who make up the bottom 60 percent of the country in terms of wealth.\\r\\nThat disparity, which sees the richest 0.1 percent of the country holding more wealth than the bottom 80 percent, has become a recurring theme in American politics, from the Occupy Wall Street movement of nearly a decade ago to more recent policy proposals from prominent Democrats aimed at addressing the divide with a highly specific tool: taxes.\\r\\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) announced a new tax on the richest Americans last month, independent of the income tax. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) referred to the possibility of raising the top tax rate to 70 percent on income over $10 million last month, spurring any number of conversations about raising taxes on the very wealthy.\\r\\nFormer Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, a member of the latter class and a possible independent presidential candidate, insists that such a move is not what America wants. Hes mostly incorrect about that, given that polls generally show support for Ocasio-Cortezs idea. But more broadly, polls consistently show supporting for raising taxes on the wealthy in general terms.\\r\\nCNN recently polled on both Ocasio-Cortezs proposal and, in vague terms, Warrens. Surprisingly, the new tax of 70 percent on income over $10 million was more unpopular than popular, except among Democrats. The general tax on those earning $50 million or more saw broader support.\\r\\nThat view of Ocasio-Cortezs proposal didnt match other polls. Fox News, for example, asked Americans whether they supported raising taxes on everyone, on those earning at least $250,000, on those earning $1 million or on those earning $10 million.\\r\\nAlmost no one supported raising taxes on everyone, but wide majorities supported higher taxes on those earning at least $1 million.\\r\\nEven most Republicans here support taxing those earning at least $10 million a year.\\r\\nHow do we square that result with CNNs? The difference probably lies in the specificity of the CNN question. In the Fox poll, a vague Should they pay more? even got a thumbs up for those earning at least $250,000, a relatively low number. Had that, too, been accompanied by the 70 percent figure, the results would likely have been different.\\r\\nAfter all, people regularly misunderstand (or, sometimes, intentionally misrepresent) the proposal as mandating that the rich pay 70 percent of all of their income to the government; in reality, it would only apply starting at the 10 millionth dollar. That 70 percent seems intimidating, but we showed last month how it would affect the taxes paid by the very wealthy.\\r\\nThe gap between that black line and the diagonal green line is the income that the very rich would still get to keep.\\r\\nAn Economist-YouGov poll last month that asked specifically about Ocasio-Cortezs proposal and Warrens idea found that both have more support than not, although support for Warrens additional tax (at 2 or 3 percent) is more popular (and earns majority support) than Ocasio-Cortezs.\\r\\nIts almost as though the hard part of any solution is establishing the specifics to that solution. [Editors: Is there a more concise aphorism we can use here?]\\r\\nEven given numbers that have broad support from voters, its not clear that such legislation would ever pass Congress. After all, Americans have supported taxing richer Americans at a higher rate for literally decades, according to Gallup.\\r\\nFinding legislation that could pass Congress and get a presidential signature has proved elusive even as income inequality has grown. It seems particularly unlikely that legislation raising taxes on the wealthy would be signed into law by a billionaire president whos committed to cutting taxes.',\n",

The statement issued by House Speaker\\xa0Nancy Pelosi\\xa0and the rest of the Democratic leadership team followed the latest in a string of controversial comments from the freshman lawmaker -- as well as pressure from Republican leaders to speak out. ‘Anti-Semitism must be called out, confronted and condemned whenever it is encountered, without exception,’ the statement said. ‘We are and will always be strong supporters of Israel in Congress because we understand that our support is based on shared values and strategic interests.\\xa0Legitimate criticism of Israel’s policies is protected by the values of free speech and democratic debate that the United States and Israel share.\\xa0…’ Omar, in response, ‘unequivocally’ apologized, while reaffirming the ‘problematic role’ of lobbyists.”\\r\\nWilliamson: ‘The defining characteristic of our political discourse in 2019 is not that it is\\xa0polarized, but that it is\\xa0illiterate.’ -\\xa0National Review\\r\\nAn unhappy association for American liberals -\\xa0The Atlantic: “Her comments, and the backlash they provoked, show how fractured the American debate over Israel has become. Omar is the new face of anti-Israel criticism on the left, and yet her use of anti-Semitic tropes undermines her credibility. Her comments have provoked a cycle of outrage, amplifying the most extreme voices on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and limiting the chances for more nuanced debate over America’s support for Israeli policies. Instead of creating more space for critical debate about Israel, Omar has added credence to a common caricature of the anti-Israel left: that opposition to Israel is partly fueled by conspiratorial anti-Semitism.”\\r\\nTHE RULEBOOK: WELLLLLLL…“The process of election affords a moral certainty, that the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications.” –\\xa0Alexander Hamilton,\\xa0Federalist No. 68\\xa0\\r\\nTIME OUT:\\xa0LOOK, A SQUIRREL\\xa0The Paris Review:\\xa0“‘I read books to read myself,’\\xa0Sven Birkerts\\xa0wrote in\\xa0The Gutenberg Elegies: The Fate of Reading in an Electronic Age.

And we need more joy.’ The former San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general said legalization would have to come with some caveats, emphasizing a need for research on the effects of marijuana on the developing brain and a means for regulating use of the drug while driving.”\\r\\nKlobuchar says she’s tough enough -\\xa0[Minneapolis] Star Tribune:\\xa0“Against a wintry Minneapolis backdrop,\\xa0Amy Klobuchar\\xa0announced her run for President on Sunday with a vow to ‘heal the heart of our democracy’ and an emphasis on her Minnesota roots. ‘As president, I will look you in the eye,’ Klobuchar said, her hair thick with falling snow by the end of her speech at Boom Island Park. ‘I will tell you what I think. I will focus on getting things done. That’s what I’ve done my whole life.’ By officially joining the fray, Klobuchar enters into competition with a growing roster of Democrats who want to challenge President Donald Trump in 2020.

She said that replacing Mr. Trump, whose administration she called ‘the most corrupt in living memory,’ was only the first step in fighting back against a system tilted in favor of the wealthy. … The selection of Lawrence was symbolic: In 1912, a historic labor strike was started by a group of women at Everett Mill, where Ms. Warren made her announcement. The senator drew on the strike as a story of women, many of them immigrants, taking on a stacked system and triumphing by gaining raises, overtime and other benefits.”\\r\\nBennet may join the fray -\\xa0WaPo:\\xa0“Sen.\\xa0Michael F.

Before being appointed to the Senate in 2009, Bennet, an attorney, served as superintendent of Denver Public Schools and worked for a large private company.”\\r\\nBUDGET TALKS RESUME ON BORDER SECURITY\\xa0AP:\\xa0“Budget negotiators will meet Monday to revive talks over border security issues that are central to legislation to prevent key parts of the government from shutting down on Saturday, but an air of pessimism remains after talks broke down over the weekend. They collapsed over Democratic demands to limit the number of migrants authorities can detain, and the two sides remained separated over how much to spend on President Donald Trump’s promised border wall. A Friday midnight deadline is looming to prevent a second partial government shutdown. Key negotiators plan to meet on Monday, Democratic and GOP aides say, but for now the mood is not hopeful. Rising to the fore on Sunday was a related dispute over curbing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, the federal agency that Republicans see as an emblem of tough immigration policies and Democrats accuse of often going too far. Trump blamed Democrats in the migrant detention dispute…”\\r\\nNewsom to pull National Guard troops back from border -\\xa0NBC News: “California Gov.\\xa0Gavin Newsom\\xa0will announce plans Monday to pull back all members of the National Guard who have been deployed to the border with Mexico, saying the state would not be part of the Trump administration\\'s ‘manufactured crisis.’ The 360 National Guard troops in California will be redeployed to fight wildfires, expand the state\\'s Drug Task Force and collect intelligence on drug cartels, Newsom will announce. Newsom\\'s decision comes a week after New Mexico Gov. Michelle Grisham ordered most of her state\\'s National Guard troops back from the border, citing President Donald Trump\\'s ‘border fear-mongering’ as the only reason for their deployment. Former California Gov. Jerry Brown agreed to the deployment of the National Guard troops last year, but said they would not be used to enforce immigration laws. Brown, Newsom and Grisham are Democrats.”\\r\\nPergram: ‘Will stalled border security talks lead to the next government shutdown?’ -\\xa0Fox News:\\xa0“Here’s the other problem: the president isn’t going to get anywhere near $5.7 billion for a wall or a physical barrier, regardless of what you want to call it. In fact, he may not even score $2 billion. The number is more likely to clock in at $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in spending for a border barrier – although Fox News has heard figures well below those numbers. ‘It’s not going to be good no matter what they reach and he won’t sign it,’ said one source close to the president. There are limitations as to how much money border security conferees can allocate to the Department of Homeland Security bill. The total cost of the measure would likely hover around $49 billion to $50 billion for Fiscal Year 2019. If conferees were to really explode spending for the wall, they’d have to cut other DHS priorities.

       "       'Last year was open source software\\'s long-awaited spotlight moment, and the flash of excitement is now spreading to a broad group of startups betting that the business of giving software away is ready to explode. \\r\\n A series of high-profile open source deals filled the calendar in 2018, as Salesforce acquired Mulesoft, Microsoft acquired GitHub, VMware acquired Heptio, IBM announced it would acquire Red Hat, Cloudera and Hortonworks merged and Elastic went public. \\r\\n OSS Capital founder Joseph Jacks, whose venture capital firm focuses on open source startups, reckons that there was roughly $70 billion in mergers and acquisitions, private equity and IPOs involving open source last year. And he estimates that there\\'s been another $2 billion in funding for commercial open source startups in the past year, as startups like Confluent, Neo4j, HashiCorp and GitLab raised money. \\r\\n \"That\\'s an astronomically huge number,\" Jacks said. \"We\\'ve never seen that much activity, commercially speaking, from a business perspective. We\\'ve never seen that much activity in open source.\" \\r\\n Although open source software has been around for decades, the technology is suddenly hitting its stride as a business. \\r\\n Despite creating software that they give away for free, these startups have a recipe for success that they\\'re continuously improving and refining, along with a hungry clientele that\\'s clamoring for more. The developers and engineers that open source software is aimed at now enjoy more influence and clout within their companies than ever before. \\r\\n And many of the open source companies make bank. According to Jacks, who tracks these companies, there are now 40 commercial open source software companies that generate $100 million or more in annual revenue. Four years ago, only eight companies were in that club. \\r\\nAccel\\'s Dan Levine\\r\\n Accel \\r\\nIn the coming year, investors expect more growth in these types of startups, as well as more M&A, private equity, IPO\\'s and funding in that space. \\r\\n \"We\\'re as interested as ever in open source startups,\" Daniel Levine, partner at Accel, told Business Insider. \"We keep seeing it as a viable business model. There have been great results in the open source world recently in terms of acquisitions and companies going public. I think for a long time, we were always surprised at how little interest there was.\" \\r\\n Investors are excited because customers are excited \\r\\n Levine says that many investors grew up during a time when Microsoft was spreading the word that open source is bad for business. \\r\\n Now Microsoft has completely converted, and with its acquisition of GitHub it\\'s one of the companies that made a major play last year in the open source space. And there\\'s an uptick in open source interest — a turnaround for many investors. \\r\\n \"Developers want to see how many developers trust this software,\" Dave Munichiello, general partner at GV, told Business Insider. \"The open source software world is fantastic because you can quickly assess if software works for you.\" \\r\\n Investors are excited about open source because customers are excited about it. A growing number of companies are using open source alternatives like Kubernetes for their workloads, rather than spending money to buy proprietary software. And more companies are discovering open source as they move their operations to the cloud. \\r\\nRead more:Everything you need to know about Kubernetes, the Google-created open source software so popular even Microsoft and Amazon had to adopt it\\r\\n In fact, Jacks, of OSS Capital, is so bullish on the trend that he started his firm specifically to invest in commercial open source software startups. \\r\\n A counterintuitive business model \\r\\n Giving away software for free is an inherently counterintuitive business model. And there\\'s still plenty of hand-wringing and doubts about whether an open source company can really build a sustainable business around free software. \\r\\n In the past year, MongoDB, Redis Labs and Confluent have changed their licenses in response to cloud giants like Amazon and Baidu taking their software to sell on their clouds — a practice that\\'s completely legal. \\r\\nEric Anderson, principal of Scale Venture Partners\\r\\n Scale Venture Partners \\r\\nEric Anderson, principal of Scale Venture Partners, says that while he\\'s seen investors more excited about open source than they used to be, he\\'s also seen the opposite. \\r\\n \"Some investors have been wary for some time that it\\'s hard to turn on the monetization engine for open source,\" Anderson said. \\r\\nRead more:An influential group sponsored by the Silicon Valley tech titans warns that efforts are underway to \\'undermine the integrity of open source\\'\\r\\n But investors in open source startups counter that making software available as open source has advantages over proprietary software, and, they say, it\\'s often easier to build open source companies. \\r\\n \"I think it\\'s actually just as hard if not harder for traditional legacy proprietary software companies to make money,\" Jacks said. \"They\\'re arguably more capital intensive.\" \\r\\n That\\'s because the people behind the software don\\'t need to raise money to create value. Since anyone can contribute code to an open source project, the software can evolve much faster without a company needing to hire a team of developers. \\r\\n Nor does the company need to spend as much on resources like sales or marketing. Instead of paying salespeople to get customers, an open source company can acquire customers cheaply as the software itself is the sales tool. \\r\\n With open source software available for anyone to download for free, people don\\'t need to be persuaded to use it. They just need to try it out. If the product is good, a community can quickly emerge around it, spreading the word and building user loyalty. \\r\\n \"If you build something that\\'s compelling to software developers and engineers, you benefit from a network effect,\" Jacks said. \"If those projects were proprietary and you want to get a similar level of global adoption and level, it would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to get there.\" \\r\\n This applies to getting VC money, too. When investors see thousands of people using the software, they can already get a sense how much traction and demand the product has. By the time VC\\'s invest, the company has already found some success. And when they see all the exits that commercial open source startups have made in the past year, they get excited. \\r\\n \"We are excited about open source in general,\" Munichiello said. \"It tends to be cutting edge. As a result of it being open, some of the best developers have tested it. We get a sense of how they are able to create value.\" \\r\\n And sure, it can be hard to turn open source software into a business, but it\\'s tough to turn any kind of software into a business, Munichiello adds. \\r\\n \"In general, both investing and entrepreneurship are challenging,\" Munichiello said. \"There\\'s more open source companies being created, and investors are willing to put their money at risk. When investors are writing their investment theses, they\\'re thinking about the upside.\" \\r\\n A cloudy landscape \\r\\n In the coming year, investors expect more change and innovation around the way commercial open source companies license and monetize their software. This is a question that some companies are still wrestling with. \\r\\n Right now there isn\\'t one standard business license for these types of companies to use. One startup Tidelift was even built around finding an alternative way for open source developers to make money off of contributing to and supporting open source projects that enterprises rely on. \\r\\nTidelift\\'s founders Donald Fischer, Luis Villa, Jeremy Katz, and Havoc Pennington\\r\\n Tidelift \\r\\n\"I think we\\'ll see continuing spectrum as the polarized worlds of proprietary and open continue to erode to a spectrum,\" Anderson said. \"It will be interesting to see between all these new licenses, if one emerges as a standard.\" \\r\\n Levine says he\\'s not too worried about cloud providers becoming a threat to commercial open source startups. For the enterprise software that startups sell, they usually offer additional features that a company like Amazon can\\'t take. \\r\\n \"You have to work a little harder and compete, but that\\'s true of anything,\" Levine said. \"The key is you want to make sure your community is happy and [that they are] your customers.\"',\n",

People surmise that it must be difficult to cover Jeff and Amazon. But weve gone five and a half years with his ownership, and he hasnt once intervened in any way.\\r\\nThe clash between Mr. Bezos and The Enquirer began last month when the tabloid published an exposé of his extramarital affair with the television personality Lauren Sanchez. Mr. Bezos fought back in his remarkably revealing blog post on Medium, the online open platform. He accused David J. Pecker, the chairman of The Enquirers parent company, American Media Inc., of threatening through intermediaries to publish graphic photographs of Mr. Bezos if he did not publicly announce that The Enquirers reporting on his affair was not politically motivated.\\r\\nThe Post has traditionally focused on the nations capital, with not as many resources devoted to business coverage. That has started to change. The Post had previously said it would nearly double the number of journalists devoted to covering Silicon Valley to 25, including a reporter in Seattle who will focus on Amazon.\\r\\nIt also aggressively followed up on the revelation about Mr. Bezos private life.\\r\\nThe Post published a lengthy article on Feb. 5 about The Enquirers coverage of Mr. Bezos affair. It quoted Gavin de Becker, his longtime security chief, as saying the leak of evidence of Mr. Bezos infidelity to The Enquirer was politically motivated, designed to embarrass Mr. Bezos because he owns The Post. Mr. de Becker added that the effort could also involve figures from President Trumps campaign.\\r\\nEmails from American Media that Mr. Bezos included in his blog post referred to the Post article and demanded that he and the newspaper refrain from any statements or suggestions that politics played any part in its coverage of his affair with Ms. Sanchez.\\r\\nLike other newspapers, including The New York Times, The Post ran front-page articles on Mr. Bezos and American Media on Friday and Saturday. Those were not the only articles about his interests. The paper also published a report about Amazons potentially pulling out of its agreement to build a headquarters in New York City, as well as one about a lawsuit filed against Amazon by the director Woody Allen, who said its streaming service had improperly backed out of a four-movie deal with him.',\n",
       "       'To be perfectly blunt, I think it is disingenuous to say you would support a congestion-pricing plan and then talk about the number of carve-outs that youve suggested today, Mr. Carroll said.\\r\\nThat was immediately followed by a critique from another Democrat, Senator Diane J. Savino, who represents Staten Island and parts of southern Brooklyn, who said that many of her constituents, as well as residents of transit-starved sections of the Bronx and Queens, drove because they did not have the luxury of a one-seat ride via public transportation.\\r\\nNot everyone who drives to work is rich, Ms. Savino said.\\r\\nMr. de Blasios testimony also took place amid simmering tension between Mr. Cuomo and the Democratic-led Senate over the issue of a plan to put a corporate campus for Amazon in Queens, using billions of dollars in state and city tax incentives. On Friday, Mr. Cuomo accused the Senate of governmental malpractice in its approach to the plan, particularly the proposed appointment of a prominent Amazon critic, State Senator Michael Gianaris, to a board with potential veto power.\\r\\nMr. de Blasio found himself repeatedly defending the deal in the face of questions from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, including Senator John Liu, another newly elected Democrat who wondered aloud why Amazon was being given tax breaks potentially worth $3 billion when tech companies like Google have said they would expand their work force without such incentives.\\r\\nMr. de Blasio countered, saying the Amazon deal was pro forma. The vast majority of the subsidy that Amazon got was standing incentive programs, he said. At another moment, Senator Jessica Ramos of Queens, a former aide to Mr. de Blasio, suggested that the most logical option for a progressive leader would have been to raise taxes on Amazon, rather than to give it tax breaks.\\r\\nAnd so on. (Mr. de Blasio pointed out several times, seemingly to no avail, that state lawmakers, not he, had the power to make the changes they were requesting.)\\r\\nThen, too, there was the small issue of Mr. Cuomo, Mr. de Blasios most prominent and powerful critic here. Mr. de Blasios remarks made it clear that there were conflicts in his wanting more funding for education and the citys decrepit public housing.',\n",
       "       'Despite the will of the people, the Republican-controlled Congress clung to its do-nothing approach after the Parkland shooting and others like it. At the state level, however, there has been action. The private sector also got involved. Dicks Sporting Goods and Walmart both halted the sale of assault-style weapons in their stores, along with the sale of guns and ammunition to customers under age 21. Companies ranging from MetLife to Delta to Alamo Rent A Car did away with discounts for N.R.A. members.\\r\\nThe political world has sensed this shift in the wind. Of late, more lawmakers have seemed willing to boast about their poor ratings by the gun lobby. The 2018 elections were the first in which spending for gun-safety advertising exceeded that for guns-rights ads, and candidates backed by gun-safety groups enjoyed important victories.\\r\\nNot all of the change can be directly attributable to Mr. Trump, of course. But, much as womens frustration over his presidency helped drive the #MeToo movement, his administration has energized gun-safety advocates, who have put the gun lobby and its cause on the defensive.\\r\\nThis wont yield an imminent revolution on regulating firearms, especially within the overly cautious halls of Congress. The N.R.A. remains a political powerhouse, an increasingly conservative Republican Party still controls the White House and the Senate, and guns remain a centerpiece of the culture war.\\r\\nBut with a topic this polarizing, small steps deserve to be applauded and encouraged. When lawmakers held a hearing on the background-check bill last week, it was the first hearing in eight years to broach the subject of gun violence.\\r\\nWith a little luck and some political spine, more such actions will follow.

Of all those possible suspects, I\\'m the only one who never had access to below-the-belt selfies. So any attempt to implicate me in this is 100 percent false.\"\\r\\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE\\'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY\\'S HOTTEST STORIES\\r\\nThe source said Lauren Sanchez also shared a few innocuous Bezos texts and pictures with her brother, including a shot of the couple posing on a mountaintop, out of a sense of love and pride. Investigators did not ask to examine Michael Sanchez\\'s computer or phone.\\r\\nGavin de Becker, the prominent security consultant who is overseeing the probe for Bezos, declined to comment.\\r\\nDe Becker has interviewed Michael Sanchez as part of the leak probe, and for that reason has dismissed Sanchez\\'s disparaging comments about him. Bezos has called de Becker \"one of the smartest and most capable leaders I know.\"\\r\\nSanchez himself told Bezos and his sister when the story broke that he would have to be investigated because of his proximity to the couple. He specifically assured them that he is not the leaker.\\r\\nMichael Sanchez, a Hollywood talent manager, has tried, with little success, to play a peacemaking role. Days before the Enquirer published the story about Bezos\\' affair, the tabloid sent Sanchez a letter — with 44 bullet points — requesting comment.\\r\\nMichael Sanchez planned to fly to New York to find out what evidence the tabloid had and try to soften the story while pointing out factual errors. He made arrangements to sit down with Dylan Howard, a longtime friend who is the tabloid company\\'s top news executive. Sanchez kept in communication with the couple and de Becker about his intermediary role and planned a conference call with them once he was briefed on the details of the pending Enquirer story.\\r\\nBut Bezos decided to preempt the story by tweeting about his planned divorce from his wife, McKenzie. At that point, AMI executives refused to meet with Sanchez and soon published the piece.\\r\\nStill, Michael Sanchez kept trying to broker a cease-fire. He arranged a photo op with Lauren Sanchez as she went to a Santa Monica airport and got on a helicopter, with AMI\\'s Us Weekly running the \"exclusive\" pictures under the headline \"All Smiles: First Photos Show Jeff Bezos\\' Girlfriend Lauren Sanchez Carefree After Scandal.\"\\r\\nBut that limited cooperation imploded late last week when Bezos accused AMI of trying to blackmail him, posting a company email suggesting that his nude selfies could be published unless he stopped accusing the Enquirer of a politically motivated hit job.\\r\\nThe behind-the-scenes battle turns on fundamental questions about Bezos\\'\\xa0strategy. Is he a journalistic hero, praised by Bob Woodward, taking a brave stand against terrible tabloid tactics? Or, as Michael Sanchez has argued, has Bezos inflamed the situation and turned one embarrassing episode into a nonstop national soap opera?\\r\\nMichael Sanchez is a Trump supporter, and his connections to Trump World figures caught up in the Robert Mueller probe have also come under scrutiny in light of the well-known acrimony between the president and Bezos.\\r\\nSanchez has twice met Roger Stone, who has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges, and Carter Page once through a minor business deal. But he has been in touch with both men about the leaks and whether they might have involved hacking, according to electronic correspondence.\\r\\nIn fact, Michael Sanchez proposed that de Becker, and possibly Bezos himself, sit down with Page in a secure location to discuss the security aspects of the leak. De Becker seemed interested, but no meeting materialized. Sanchez told me that Bezos, his sister, and de Becker knew of every conversation he has had with Page and Stone. The Washington Post reported that both Page and Stone have denied any involvement in the Bezos leak.\\r\\nThe stakes are sky-high for all sides. AMI is under an immunity deal with federal prosecutors after Pecker acknowledged his involvement in hush-money payments to Trump accusers, and any finding of improper behavior now could have legal consequences.\\r\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\r\\nLauren Sanchez, a former L.A. television host, has been an entertainment reporter, host of Fox\\'s \"So You Think You Can Dance,\" and runs a film production company. She is married to Patrick Whitesell, co-CEO of powerhouse talent agency William Morris Endeavor.\\r\\nBezos is not only facing personal embarrassment, but his divorce could impact his Amazon fortune and perhaps the company itself.',\n",

       "       'The first tickets go on sale this week for Virgin Voyages, a Miami-based cruise operator aiming to launch the first of the four ships it is building early next year. Within days, a group of New York banks are expected to price a potential $3bn initial public offering of Virgin Trains, a new passenger rail service in Florida. \\r\\nBy the end of February a Virgin Hotel will open in San Francisco and a Virgin Galactic space aircraft hopes to make its second test flight from California’s Mojave desert to the edge of space. The Long Beach-headquartered Virgin Orbit plans to celebrate the launch of its first commercial satellite by the summer.\\xa0\\r\\nAs it prepares to mark the 50th anniversary of Sir Richard Branson founding Virgin as a mail order records business in 1970, the executive who now runs the company is laying out ambitious plans to push into a US market where the brand has been far less well-known — and lucrative — than in the UK.\\xa0\\r\\nJosh Bayliss, a Slaughter and May-trained New Zealander who stepped up from general counsel to chief executive in 2011, says he has tried to bring focus to a private group that still spans 68 companies in 34 countries.\\xa0\\r\\nHOTELS\\r\\n© Bloomberg\\r\\nThe first Virgin Hotel opened in Chicago in 2016, with Branson-esque touches such as a louche “shag room”, but the Miami-based management team have been tinkering with the model before rolling it out further.\\xa0\\r\\n“It took a long time to get to the end of the beginning,” Josh Bayliss concedes, but the team has now settled on a concept, pitching the offering as “a home away from home” — particularly for women. Rooftop bars, performance spaces to attract local musicians and restaurants designed to attract locals as well as tourists are all part of the new formula.\\xa0\\r\\nThe Chicago hotel is now “highly profitable”, Mr Bayliss says. Further openings are planned for San Francisco, Nashville and Dallas this year, followed by a branch in New York and a rebranding of the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas.\\r\\nAt times in Virgin’s first 49 years, it has seemed unclear what held its portfolio together other than the whims of its founder. Mr Bayliss says Virgin is now “more deliberate” about where it applies its brand than in the days when Sir Richard was launching cola, vodka, cosmetics and bridal wear under the motto “screw it, let’s do it”.\\xa0\\r\\n“There’s a misconception of Richard as someone who [just] slaps the brand on things,” he adds, contrasting Virgin with another brand-focused multinational that was fronted for years by a stunt-loving billionaire: “It’s very different from the way the Trump Organization works.”\\r\\nVirgin has also become more focused on finding financial partners with longer-term investment horizons, such as sovereign wealth funds and pension funds, and on picking industries where it sees the potential to build multibillion-dollar businesses by offering a better experience for “underserved” consumers.\\xa0\\r\\nThe US, as the world’s largest consumer market, has obvious appeal. But it took an apparent retreat to fund its current advance: in 2016 Alaska Air paid $2.6bn for Virgin America, the domestic airline the UK group had launched in an earlier bid for bigger US revenues.\\xa0\\r\\nSir Richard, with just over 30 per cent of what was then a public company, lamented that he was powerless to stop the sale and later implied that Alaska had “castrated” the carrier by dropping the Virgin name. But the transaction provided Mr Bayliss with capital to explore other opportunities for the brand in the US, and the pending £220m sale of a 31 per cent stake in Virgin Atlantic to Air France-KLM will add further resources.\\xa0\\r\\nVirgin has invested $2.3bn since 2008 in the US, Mr Bayliss says — most of it in Virgin America. The recent ramp-up of investments means Virgin is losing money in the US, but it expects a substantial payback over the next five years. Virgin Voyages, the cruise business backed by Bain Capital and GIC, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, has required $150m-$200m. It has also put $75m-$100m into Virgin Hotels, which so far has only one property opened in Chicago but plans to open nine in the next three years, from Nashville to Las Vegas.\\r\\nListing documents for the Fortress-backed Virgin Trains, in which Virgin will have no more than a 2 per cent stake, suggest its investment there could be $50m-$60m. And then there are the much delayed space launches, into which Sir Richard said last year he had poured about $1bn of his own money and which Mr Bayliss says could still require “significantly more capital”.\\r\\nIt is difficult to confirm such sums from the published accounts of offshoots of Virgin Group Holdings, the private parent company which is registered in the tax efficient British Virgin Islands where Sir Richard resides. However, they offer a picture of a group that is still heavily dependent on the UK, 35 years after the first Virgin flight across the Atlantic.\\xa0\\r\\nIn the latest accounts for Virgin Enterprises Limited, for example, the subsidiary that oversees the high-margin licensing of the Virgin brand made £40m of its £73m turnover from the UK in 2017 and only £7.3m from North America — less than the sum it generated in Australia and New Zealand.\\xa0\\r\\nSuch accounts note the companies’ vulnerability to any decline in the perception of the Virgin brand, and the group’s efforts to crack the US have had to overcome the shock of a fatal crash of an earlier Virgin Galactic test flight in 2014. \\r\\nCRUISES\\r\\nThe 278-metre long Scarlet Lady, destined to hold almost 2,800 passengers, floated out of Fincantieri’s Genoa shipyard last week, ready to be fitted with interiors designed to attract a crowd that defies cruise stereotypes.\\xa0\\r\\nThe first of four ships Virgin and Bain Capital have ordered for their Virgin Voyages venture over the next four years, it will test how keen “urbane, young, experience-led” millennials are to spend their time off at sea. “It is classic Virgin territory. We definitely think we can shake things up,” Mr Bayliss says, adding that Virgin Atlantic is already Europe’s biggest reseller of cruise holidays.\\r\\nVirgin Voyages is tapping a growing market: the Cruise Lines International Association projects 6 per cent growth for the industry in 2019, which would take it to 30m travellers, up from 17.8m a decade earlier. But Virgin is chasing a relatively new demographic.\\xa0Under-18s will not be allowed, Mr Bayliss notes, and “there won’t be a buffet”.\\r\\n“It was a terrible, terrible accident from a human point of view” and cost the business “hundreds of millions of dollars” to rebuild the spacecraft, Mr Bayliss says, but he argues that it also made the team more resilient.\\xa0Sir Richard owns 80 per cent of the US company, with Mubadala of Abu Dhabi owning the rest, so the entrepreneur bore most of the estimated $300m-$400m cost of the crash.\\r\\nAfter many delays, Mr Bayliss will not predict when the first passengers will be able to gain a new perspective on our planet, but he notes that one person — an oil executive making weekly trips from London Heathrow to Lagos — has earned a free flight to space by racking up 1m air miles on Virgin Atlantic.\\xa0\\r\\nVirgin and Delta Air Lines announced last year that they would combine the UK airline’s Flying Club loyalty programme with Virgin Red, which offers rewards to people spending money with companies in the group, from Virgin Media to Virgin Balloon Flights. “Now you’ve got not just a membership club but a currency,” says Mr Bayliss, who sees the new programme creating more “connectivity” between the group’s businesses.\\xa0\\r\\nIt could also extend the brand further if Mr Bayliss achieves another of his goals: to find a partner for a US version of Virgin Money, the financial services brand it operates in the UK with Clydesdale Bank, in Australia with Bank of Queensland and in South Africa with Absa Bank.\\xa0\\r\\n“They’ve been great businesses for us to invest in. That’s the sort of thing we’d look to replicate in North America,” he says, skipping over an earlier, shortlived foray into US peer-to-peer lending using the Virgin Money brand.\\r\\nVirgin is actively looking at financial services opportunities in North America, with a preference for building on an existing current account platform where it can improve the experience for customers wanting “something a little more exciting and interesting”, Mr Bayliss says. He hopes to seal a Virgin Money US deal this year, but the group has not yet found a likely partner.\\xa0\\r\\nWith Virgin’s longer-term aspirations for the US including radio stations and hyperloop transportation systems, it adds up to a dizzying wish list, but Mr Bayliss insists its US expansion can be coherent.\\xa0\\r\\n“We have got huge amounts of skin in lots and lots of games, all of which, I think, link to one another in a sensible way,” he says.\\r\\nTRAINS\\r\\n© Bloomberg\\r\\nVirgin and Stagecoach were stripped last year of the franchise for operating train services on the UK’s East Coast route between London and Scotland after breaching a financial covenant. Passenger railways in the US are also “not what they were”, Mr Bayliss observes, yet Virgin sees a growth opportunity in a country where the car has long reigned over public transport.\\xa0\\r\\nIn November it announced a strategic partnership with Brightline, the only private intercity passenger rail service in the US. Late month the renamed Virgin Trains USA announced plans for an initial public offering on Nasdaq which could value it at $3bn, despite losses of $87m on revenues of $5.2m in the first nine months of last year. \\r\\nThe company only began running trains between Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach last year but plans to extend its service to Orlando and Tampa with an eye to hitting annual revenues of $810m within five years. It is also looking at routes including Los Angeles to Las Vegas, Dallas to Houston and Boston to Washington.',\n",
       "       'The latest panic about artificial intelligence is that it will deal a blow to women in the workplace. Women accustomed to gloomy headlines may have met this one with a fatalistic shrug. But it is worth interrogating why on earth it might be true.\\r\\nThe concerns are legitimate enough, but they fail to appreciate the big ways in which the world of work is going to change. In fact, it is quite possible the age of AI will belong to women. Men are the ones in danger of being left behind.\\r\\nThere are admittedly some reasons to worry about women. Some AI tools may be biased against them — a risk for any group that has been historically under-represented in the workplace. Because machine learning tends to learn from historical data, it can perpetuate patterns from the past into the future. Amazon reportedly discovered a few years ago that an experimental recruitment tool, based on 10 years’ worth of job application data, had taught itself to penalise CVs that contained the word “women’s”, such as “captain of the women’s hockey team”. \\r\\nOn top of that, data from LinkedIn profiles suggests 78 per cent of the people working in AI are men. Not only are they shaping the future, they are also occupying some of the best new jobs to be created in recent years. A hiring war has sent the salaries of people with machine learning PhDs into the stratosphere.\\r\\nIt is right to pay attention to these problems and work on solutions. Algorithms shouldn’t be given power without transparency, accountability, and human checks and balances. Top AI jobs should be held by a more diverse set of smart people.\\r\\nBut it is also important to remember that only a small number of the jobs of the future will actually involve creating algorithms. Far more of us will find our work reshaped and revalued by them. And it is here that women may have the advantage.\\r\\nAs machines become better at many cognitive tasks, it is likely that the skills they are relatively bad at will become more valuable. This list includes creative problem-solving, empathy, negotiation and persuasion. \\r\\nAs Andy Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England, has put it, “the high-skill, high-pay jobs of the future may involve skills better measured by EQs (a measure of emotional intelligence) than IQs”. There is no reason why men should not excel at these, but historically such skills have been more identified with — and encouraged in — women. \\r\\nIndeed, a new research paper from the University of Zurich argues the trend predicted by Mr Haldane has already begun. In the US since the 1980s, the probability of a college-educated man ending up in a highly skilled cognitive job has fallen, while the probability of a college-educated woman achieving the same feat has increased.\\r\\nThe author argues this is connected to increasing demand in these jobs for supplementary skills such as emotional intelligence, which has given women an edge. \\r\\nIt is important not to get too carried away. The trend identified in the paper has only gone some way to closing the gender gap in top jobs. And there is no sign yet of a reappraisal of the value of emotional skills in jobs such as social care, which remain some of the worst paid in the economy.\\r\\nBut as the AI era dawns, it is the right moment to overhaul the way we value these skills, and the way we teach them. With an eye on the demands of the future, we are trying to persuade girls that coding is not just for boys. So why aren’t we also trying to persuade boys that empathy is not just for girls? \\r\\nWe could start by changing the language we use. For too long we have talked about “soft skills”, with connotations of femininity and a lack of rigour. Let’s call them what they are: “robot-proof skills” that neither men nor women can afford to face the 21st century without.\\r\\nsarah.oconnor@ft.com',\n",

       "       \"(Reuters) - Walmart Inc and logistics firm Deliv pulled the plug on a key same-day grocery delivery partnership, dealing a setback in the retailer’s race against rival Amazon.com Inc to deliver groceries to customers’ homes. \\r\\nThe world’s largest retailer began bolstering its partnerships with third-party courier firms to reach consumers in 100 U.S. cities last year, after failing to use Uber and Lyft to deliver groceries, and struggling in its attempt to use its own employees to deliver goods. \\r\\nDeliv, which was one of Walmart’s earliest partners with pilot programs in Miami and San Jose, served the retailer with a 90-day termination notice, and the two companies stopped working with each other in late January, according to two people familiar with the situation. \\r\\nWalmart confirmed the previously unreported decision, and said it still partners with seven delivery firms, including DoorDash and Postmates, four of which it signed up in January. \\r\\nPeople familiar with the Walmart partnership with Deliv said the Deliv drivers had to frequently wait 40 minutes or more to collect grocery orders when they showed up at the store. One reason for that, they said, is because Walmart gives a priority to customers over delivery drivers during regular hours, which complicated the partnership. \\r\\nThe store operations at Walmart “were a huge problem,” said one of the people with direct knowledge of the matter, adding the retailer could not “process online grocery orders fast enough.” \\r\\nDeliv declined to comment. Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman told Reuters the retailer and Deliv mutually decided to end the partnership. “As with any pilot, the intent is to learn. And we ultimately came to the conclusion with Deliv that while their platform is a good delivery option, it was not the best fit for our program at this time.” \\r\\nBlakeman said same-day grocery delivery is currently available in 800 of its more than 5,000 U.S. stores and warehouse clubs, and the retailer plans to add 800 more this year. \\r\\nDeliv offers scheduled same-day deliveries through gig drivers, a model which can work well with faster order processing and a better ability to predict demand and robust volumes. Walmart is now working mostly with restaurant delivery firms that deliver an order as and when it is generated, one of the sources said. \\r\\nBoth sources said order volumes were low in many markets, and one source said orders had to be delivered over large distances, resulting in both Deliv and Walmart losing money. \\r\\n“When the partnership with Deliv was struck, the hope was that demand will be stronger than it is now,” one of the sources said. \\r\\nDeliv operates in 1,400 U.S. cities, tapping into networks of local freelance drivers to deliver packages same-day for a fee for a range of retailers, from Home Depot Inc to Kohl’s Corp. \\r\\nIn October, it raised $40 million in a new round of financing from investors, including Alphabet Inc’s Google and United Parcel Service. In December, it signed up 20 new U.S. retailers including Nike Inc and Nordstrom. \\r\\nDeliv can process and deliver thousands of orders in an hour. Walmart in San Jose was sometimes generating only a hundred orders a week, and there were problems processing that volume through stores, one of the sources said. Walmart is working to fix the problems at its stores to process orders faster, the source added. \\r\\nBlakeman said there were no problems with order volume in the market. \\r\\nThe sources also told Reuters that Walmart has ended a separate grocery delivery test from 2017, in which it partnered with smart security company August Home and Deliv for keyless entries to shoppers homes, to deliver groceries directly to their refrigerator. \\r\\nReporting by Nandita Bose in Washington; Editing by Vanessa O'Connell and Edward Tobin\",\n",

       "       '\"He sees things from the top.\" \\r\\n That\\'s how billionaire investor Ray Dalio describes his idol, Paul Volcker— the former Federal Reserve chair who\\'s commonly viewed as one of the most important and influential figures in US economic history. \\r\\n It was that zoomed-out perspective that helped Volcker rescue America from the skyrocketing inflation that afflicted it in the late 1970s and early 1980s. His tight monetary policy was unpopular in the short term, but he was proven correct by 1983. Inflation came down, growth surged, and the US enjoyed a decade of economic prosperity. \\r\\n And while that\\'s arguably Volcker\\'s crowning achievement, he stayed active for decades after leaving the Fed in 1987. \\r\\n One prime example was his stint as chairman of the Economic Recovery Advisory Board under former president Barack Obama, a position he held for roughly two years from 2009 to 2011. As part of that role, he unveiled the so-called Volcker Rule, which was intended to scale back risky behavior by banks. \\r\\nRead more: Legendary billionaire Ray Dalio told a crowd at Davos that the next economic meltdown scares him more than anything — here\\'s what he said, and why he\\'s so worried\\r\\n Volcker recently sat down to chat with Dalio, who\\'s become a legend himself by founding Bridgewater Associates, the world\\'s largest hedge fund. The two titans of modern finance discussed everything from broad economic principles to the current US political situation. \\r\\n Dalio was particularly interested to hear about Volcker\\'s guiding principles — the ones that he\\'s used to make important decisions and assess the environment around him. After all, Dalio led the discussion by saying he views Volcker as the \"most principled person\" he knows. \\r\\n The conversation came several months after the release of Volcker\\'s new book, \"Keeping At It: The Quest for Sound Money and Good Government,\" which hit shelves on Oct. 30, 2018. \\r\\n Here\\'s a summary of three principles Volcker laid out, which — in the spirit of his book — are specifically geared towards what makes a strong government. \\r\\n (1) Effective governance \\r\\n \"Alexander Hamilton put it all in a nutshell. He\\'s an old Treasury guy, a financial guy. He restored the credit of the United States, so he\\'s a hero of mine.\" \\r\\n \"He said the true test of good government is its ability to administer, not to create policy. Can they carry out the policies effectively and economically? Good government is not just high policy, it\\'s making a machine work, day after day, efficiently.\" \\r\\n \"The faith of the American people in our government today is really distressing. We have a real challenge.\" \\r\\n (2) The economization of family spending \\r\\n \"When you talk about principles, they go down in the family. And we were not a family that spent money easily. We liked to economize and be sure how we were spending money. I \\'d like to think I carried this over when I had some responsibilities in government, to try to do it sufficiently. Not only as accurately, but as efficiently as possible.\" \\r\\n \"My father took over as city manager of this bankrupt town in 1930, and lasted for 20 years. He became the principle figure in town. He was a fanatic for disclosure. He would do a very detailed budget every year, and distribute it to everyone in town.\" \\r\\n \"He was a bug for not spending more than he had to spend, but spending what was necessary for a professional organization.\" \\r\\n (3) A strong class of civil servants \\r\\n \"I\\'m with Alexander Hamilton. The true test of effective government is the ability to get something done efficiently. We lapse in that respect. You have to have a great feeling of commitment to whatever you\\'re doing, whether it\\'s as an economist, or a civil servant.\" \\r\\n \"Look at this present change in government. I think there are 700 or more potential presidential appointments in the new government. About one-third of those offices are filled. But nobody\\'s paying attention. Who\\'s running those departments?\" \\r\\n \"Civil servants left there may be in good form, maybe not, but they\\'re essentially leaderless. That\\'s no way to run a government. That\\'s just one example of the difficulties we\\'re having these days.\" \\r\\n \"Countries like France and Germany had very disciplined, very prestigious civil service. So did the UK. That\\'s disintegrated a lot in recent years because it\\'s considered too elitist, too far removed from the public. It\\'s a great trick — how can you get the expertise and leadership you need and still respect the popular desire?\"',\n",
       "       'SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The collapse in China of a complex web of debt guarantees involving several private firms highlights risks in its financial system and opens up a potentially hazardous front for an economy in the grip of its slowest growth in nearly three decades. \\r\\nIt is the last thing Beijing needs as it tries to fight off intensifying pressure on growth from a months-long trade dispute with the United States. Yet, as the government steps up economic support measures and moves to loosen gummed-up funding, it might be inadvertently inflaming financial risks with its call on state banks to sharply boost lending to the private sector. \\r\\nThe warning bells are already sounding in the once-prosperous eastern city of Dongying, a hub for oil refining and heavy industry in Shandong province. Here, at least 28 private companies are seeking to restructure their debts and avoid bankruptcy, mainly due to souring loans that they guaranteed for other firms, court rulings seen by Reuters show. \\r\\nAmong the 28 firms are Shandong Dahai Group and Shandong Jinmao Textile Chemical Group, which were on the 2018 top 500 best-run private enterprises in China. \\r\\nFor a private firm to get bank loans in China, especially those in traditional, capital-intensive industries, it often needs substantial collateral or the guarantee of another company. The guarantor itself is very likely to have taken on loans guaranteed by other firms. \\r\\nThe private sector mess in Dongying highlights the inherent dangers in cross-guaranteeing of debt, with defaults quickly cascading across the system when one loan goes bad, threatening to disrupt local financial systems and new lending. \\r\\nThe concern is that Dongying is just the tip of the iceberg as cross-guaranteeing of loans is a common practice across China. \\r\\nPrivate firms’ funding options are somewhat constrained because banks are reluctant to lend to the non-state sector, said Yang Zaiping, secretary-general of Beijing-based Asian Financial Cooperation Association, which comprises financial institutions from about 30 countries. \\r\\n“There is a severe imbalance between private companies’ contribution to the Chinese economy and the financing that they get. They account for 50 percent of taxes, 60 percent of GDP, 80 percent of urban jobs and 90 percent of new hires, but only receive 25 percent of loans disbursed,” Yang, a former Chinese banking regulatory official, told Reuters. \\r\\n“If private companies don’t have other sources of funds to repay their debts, or collateral, they have to find guarantees, which will add 2 to 3 percentage points to their financing costs,” he said. \\r\\nSTING OF CHEAP CREDIT \\r\\nAs of end-June, Shandong Dahai had outstanding guarantees on 2.67 billion yuan ($394 million) of debt for 14 companies, according to a company filing in August. The total amount of guarantees was equivalent to 48 percent of its net assets. \\r\\nSix of the firms have run into financial or legal trouble and two have been blacklisted by courts as “dishonest debtors” for their lack of creditworthiness. \\r\\nResource-rich Dongying, the site of China’s second-largest oilfield Shengli, used to be one of the country’s richest cities thanks to its vibrant private economy, boasting the highest income per capita in Shandong in 2017. \\r\\nBut excessive lending to local companies during boom times saw firms diversify into non-profitable, non-core businesses. So when credit conditions later tightened as Beijing embarked on a years-long deleveraging campaign, a series of loan and bond defaults in the region followed. \\r\\n“Bad loans are often extended during good times,” said a Shandong-based official, who declined to be named. \\r\\nThe consequences are now clear. Two Dongying banks - Guangrao Rural Commercial Bank and Dongying Bank - have been hit by a sudden surge in non-performing loans. \\r\\nOver 95 percent of Guangrao Rural’s bad loans were backed by guarantees, but the back-stop is mostly useless now because it was provided by firms that were heavily indebted and some had suspended production, according to a ratings report in May. \\r\\nIn Dongying, the local government has come to the rescue of the private companies by pushing through debt restructuring to avoid bankruptcy, said the Shandong-based official. \\r\\nThe Dongying government’s finance bureau did not respond to a request for comment. Officials at Shandong Dahai and Shandong Jinmao declined to comment. \\r\\nTO LEND OR NOT TO LEND? \\r\\nChina’s top banking regulator Guo Shuqing, one of the most powerful men in the financial sector, wants banks to double their funding allocation to private companies in three years - to 50 percent from 25 percent. \\r\\nBut faced with the rising default risks of private borrowers in cyclical sectors, and given their unsafe financing practices - from share-pledged loans to cross guarantees - banks are wary of lending to them. \\r\\nSeveral bankers told Reuters they are keen to avoid repeating excessive and riskier lending that followed Beijing’s 4 trillion yuan stimulus package a decade ago. \\r\\nEven though China has cut banks’ reserve requirement ratios five times since January last year, banks would rather use this freed up liquidity to buy “bonds at any cost” than give out loans, said a bank executive at the financial markets department of a joint-stock bank. \\r\\nPrivate players are heavily concentrated in manufacturing and real estate whose bad loan ratios in these sectors have been much higher than the industry-average. Private companies were also the biggest defaulters last year, accounting for 126 of the total 165 bond defaults, according to Guotai Junan Securities. \\r\\nAnd, as the economy brakes in the face of domestic and external pressures, with growth slowing to a 28-year low in 2018, the fear is that the cross guarantee practice exposes China’s financial system to a bad loan crisis. \\r\\n“As growth slows and pressure increases on the economy, financial risks easily become contagious,” the Shandong official said. \\r\\n($1 = 6.7762 Chinese yuan renminbi) \\r\\nReporting By Shu Zhang in SINGAPORE, Additional Reporting by Meng Meng in BEIJING, Li Zheng in SHANGHAI and the Shanghai Newsroom; Editing by Shri Navaratnam',\n",

       "       'Breaking News Emails\\r\\nGet breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\\r\\nSUBSCRIBE\\r\\nFeb. 12, 2019, 10:00 AM GMT\\r\\nThis story was originally published by The Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, nonpartisan investigative news organization in Washington, D.C.\\r\\nSIDNEY, Ohio Toward the end of last summer, managers at global giant Emerson Electric Co. called an employee meeting at its air conditioning and refrigeration factory in this county seat of 21,000 people west of Dayton. They had big news: Each employee would get a $1,000 \"special contribution\" to a 401(k) retirement account.\\r\\nThe reason for the generosity? The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act congressional Republicans had passed, and President Donald Trump had signed in late 2017, Emerson executives told the Sidney plant employees.\\r\\nWith the announcement, Emerson joined hundreds of companies as many as 750 by one count that issued similar statements to show they were sharing the wealth of a $150 billion cash windfall firms were estimated to receive in the first year from the then newly enacted tax law. On an employee bulletin board, Emerson explained in bold type that the contribution \"Affirms Emerson\\'s Core Value to Support our People and to Help Them Prepare for Retirement!\"\\r\\nEmerson\\'s and other companies\\' payments were a publicity bonanza for the Trump administration and the then-Republican-controlled Congress. Back in 2017, as the tax bill moved on the Hill, lawmakers claimed the cut they proposed in the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent would trickle down to workers in the form of higher wages and bonuses. Emerson\\'s action, and similar bonuses and wage increases, trumpeted by hundreds of companies like AT&T Corp. and Walmart Corp., provided proof the Republicans had their economic theory right.\\r\\nOr did they? For many of those same companies, a tiny fraction of the total number of U.S. businesses, executives haven\\'t yet announced another round of bonuses or wage increases with the same fanfare even though the tax law continues to mean billions for their bottom lines. Several advocacy groups that tracked the announcements said no new proclamations have been issued. Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative anti-tax group run by Grover Norquist which boasted last year of ongoing \"good news\" in bonuses and benefit increases, hasn\\'t reported any announcement for three months. Americans for Tax Reform didn\\'t respond to requests for comment.\\r\\nAt the Emerson Electric plant in Sydney, Ohio, mangers announced last year savings from the 2017 tax law allowed them to deposit a $1,000 bonus into each employee\\'s 401(k) retirement account. The company doesn\\'t plan to give another bonus this year.Kathryn Kranhold for the Center for Public Integrity\\r\\nMost American businesses that announced bonuses and wage increases seem to be more like Emerson, which has \"no plans to make an additional 401(k) contribution this year,\" a company spokeswoman said.\\r\\nThat\\'s what has made the promise of higher compensation so far elusive. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported nominal wages increased 3.2 percent in January year over year, and by less than one percent three cents to $27.56 month over month. While some economists have voiced enthusiasm about the improvement, other economists note that wages must grow for a sustained period to offset decades of stagnation. \"The problem has not been solved,\" said Seth Harris, deputy secretary of the Labor Department in the Obama administration.\\r\\nBonuses have registered less of an impact, increasing just 2 cents an hour in the first nine months of 2018, according to Lawrence Mishel, former president of the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning research group.\\r\\nThe increase was \"imperceptible,\" Mishel wrote in December on EPI\\'s blog. \"Whatever growth in bonuses has taken place is not necessarily attributable to the tax cuts, rather than employer efforts to recruit workers in a continued low unemployment environment.\"\\r\\nBy all accounts, companies poured a hefty portion of the tax windfall into buying back shares, a move designed to at least temporarily boost stock prices, which benefits executives and other large stockholders. And buybacks, evidently unlike bonuses or wage increases, will certainly continue; Goldman Sachs estimates corporations spent a record $770 billion in 2018 on repurchasing stock with their increasing piles of after-tax profits and will increase that to $940 billion this year. Other chunks of the cuts went to dividends or reducing debt. Companies pay for ongoing stock buybacks primarily through after-tax profits that got a boost with the corporate tax cuts.\\r\\nA promise of \\'more money\\'\\r\\nBack at Emerson, as managers unveiled the news at the Sidney plant, longtime employee Lerouise Rupert, 32, said she was excited at first. \"I\\'m thinking, \\'This is going to be good.\\' They told us, \\'We\\'re going to give you a $1,000 bonus,\\'\" Rupert said recently while sitting with her three children in a nearby Wendy\\'s restaurant.\\r\\nThen Emerson managers explained the details. The bonus wasn\\'t being awarded in cash because \"\\'it would get taxed a lot,\" recalled Rupert, whose job runs from driving a forklift and loading the assembly line to building electrical boxes. So instead, they said, \"We\\'re going to put it in a 401(k) for you.\\'\"\\r\\nThe contribution has had little tangible benefit for Rupert, who has a company pension but did not have a 401(k) account at the time, and for many of her co-workers. Their real need is for money immediately to pay bills, or in Rupert\\'s case at the time, the chance to buy presents for her children instead of signing up for a local charity gift program.\\r\\n\"I was looking forward to this check for Christmas,\" she said.\\r\\nClick here to read the Center for Public Integrity\\'s version of this story\\r\\nRupert\\'s experience provides a stark contrast to how Trump and Republican lawmakers sold the tax law. \"You\\'re going to start seeing a lot more money in your paycheck,\" Trump said a year ago at an event in Nashville, Tennessee. A couple months earlier, Trump, and then-House Speaker Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., boasted the tax law would likely give typical households a $4,000 a year wage hike, with the White House reporting wages could even increase by more than $9,000 a year.\\r\\nManufacturing executives were particularly vocal, arguing that the lower corporate tax rate would not only increase wages, but also allow their companies to be more competitive globally and bring back jobs. David Farr, chief executive of Emerson Electric and former chairman of the powerful National Association of Manufacturers, helped lead the tax-cut effort and pushed for a lower 15 percent corporate tax rate.\\r\\nLerouise Rupert, whose job at Emerson Electric runs from driving a forklift and to loading the assembly line to building electrical boxes, has been trying to withdraw the cash in her retirement account but hasn\\'t gotten far with her inquiries.Courtesy of the Rupert family\\r\\nEmerson, based in Ferguson, Missouri, employs approximately 87,500 people worldwide, with about 24,000 employees in North America.\\r\\nLast May, five months into the new law, Farr told Congress, \"Tax reform is helping strengthen communities, build new career opportunities and increase paychecks for the men and women of America\\'s manufacturing workforce.\"\\r\\nAn Emerson spokeswoman said Farr was not available for an interview.\\r\\nEmerson\\'s tax rate fell to 17 percent in 2018, according to its annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and company executives estimate a rate of 24 to 25 percent this year, boosting profits. Farr told investors in an August presentation that the tax law allowed the company to increase wages and improve the company\\'s health plan, parental leave and paid time off.\\r\\nBut Emerson reported it received $189 million in tax savings, of which it spent $24 million, less than 13 percent on its 401(k) bonus contributions a payment that brought financial benefits to the company as well. Emerson also spent $1 billion more than 40 times the amount it spent on the retirement bonuses in its fiscal 2018 buying back its own shares.\\r\\nAnd for those on the ground, Emerson\\'s largesse appears limited.\\r\\nThat\\'s what employees say at Ridge Tools, an Emerson subsidiary in Elyria, outside Cleveland. The company has a commanding presence in the struggling town of 54,000, with its own water tower emblazoned with the word \"Ridgid,\" the brand name of the power tools the company makes.\\r\\nSeveral Ridge Tool employees, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Center the corporate tax cuts have not increased their salaries. They have received the same annual increase in their wages as in past years: less than 3 percent. Emerson recently increased the vacation time to three weeks from two weeks for employees who have been employed for at least five years, they said. Hourly wages at Emerson\\'s Sidney plant that make Copeland Scroll branded products increase by 3 percent a year under the union contract. An Emerson spokeswoman said the company is spending $3 million annually on improved benefits but declined to provide details. The spokeswoman said the company provides \"market-based pay increases.\"\\r\\nRidge Tool workers also received that $1,000 retirement contribution, and not all were disappointed. Joe Neudenbach, a longtime employee, said he had planned to withdraw the money immediately at 61 years old he can without paying a penalty to buy a new recliner to watch the Super Bowl. \"The $1,000 was cool. I didn\\'t see it coming,\" said Neudenbach.\\r\\nStill, the one-time bonuses and one-time 401(k) contributions have been widely panned as public relations stunts that are not financially sustaining like annual wage increases. Longtime pensions and retirement expert J. Mark Iwry said, \"It would seem appropriate for employers to share their tax savings with their workers.\"\\r\\nBonuses, then layoffs\\r\\nSome claim the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was indeed a windfall for employees in 2018. The conservative Americans for Tax Reform group kept a running tally of corporate announcements through last October and listed as many as 750 examples of \"pay raises, charitable donations, special bonuses, 401(k) match hikes, business expansions, benefit increases, and utility rate reductions attributed to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\"\\r\\nBut shareholders have fared far better than employees under the tax law. Companies spent $929 billion on stock buybacks compared to $7.1 billion on wage increases and bonuses, according to Americans for Tax Fairness, a left-leaning nonprofit group that tracked announcements by Fortune 1000 companies.\\r\\nAnother report by the nonprofit Just Capital, which tracks the Russell 1000 Index, which includes the largest U.S. public companies, found that 145 companies in the index announced plans for spending the cash windfall, and only 6 percent of spending was allocated to workers, \"more than half of which takes the form of one-time bonuses, as opposed to permanent raises or benefits.\"\\r\\nAmong the first companies to come out with announcements of bonuses and pay raises because of the tax law were Walmart and AT&T. On Jan. 11, 2018, Walmart announced it was giving out $1,000 one-time bonuses to eligible employees and increasing starting hourly wage to $11 an hour. The same day, Walmart filed notices to lay off thousands of workers. A Walmart spokesman said the company has no current plans for a 2019 company-wide bonus. He said the hourly employees\\' average total compensation and benefits is more than $17.50 an hour.\\r\\nRidge Tools, an Emerson subsidiary in Elyria, has a commanding presence in the struggling town of 54,000, with its own water tower emblazoned with the word \"Ridgid,\" the brand name of the power tools the company makes.Kathryn Kranhold for the Center for Public Integrity\\r\\nOn Dec. 20, 2017, two days before Trump signed the tax law, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson announced the tax law would allow the company to give one-time bonuses of $1,000 to each of its workers at a cost of $200 million about 1 percent of the estimated $20.4 billion tax windfall the company recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. While handing out the bonuses, AT&T was in the middle of laying off thousands of workers.\\r\\nAn AT&T spokeswoman said the company would not be handing out another bonus this year.\\r\\nBy this time last year, a number of companies including The Walt Disney Co. and Southwest Airlines had announced they would use a portion of the tax windfall to give one-time employee bonuses. Southwest said it would use $55 million of its $1.3 billion tax windfall on bonuses. At the same time, it spent $2 billion on buybacks in 2018. Disney received a $1.7 billion benefit and paid out $125 million on employee bonuses and $3.6 billion on share repurchases. None of the companies have announced another round of bonuses. Southwest said it had no plans to give bonuses this year and Lowe\\'s did not respond to requests for comment. Disney referred the Center to its January 2018 announcement.\\r\\nWill it work later?\\r\\nTo have the tax cuts translate into increased wages, the theory goes, several factors need to align. Republicans and corporations argued the tax cuts would lead to increased investment in factories and machinery. That would create more productive and valuable workers, which \"would bid up the wages,\" said Mark Mazur, head of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington. But for that to happen, \"every linkage has to work,\" he said.\\r\\nMeanwhile, in Sidney, Rupert is still trying to cash out her $1,000 retirement contribution, which was the only deposit in her 401(k) account because she didn\\'t have one when Emerson gave out the bonuses last year.\\r\\nRupert said she is willing to pay the penalty for an early withdrawal but she hasn\\'t gotten far with her inquiries.\\r\\nA frustrated Rupert said the last time she checked her account the balance was just $867, a likely victim of the stock market fluctuation.\\r\\nThe Center for Public Integrity is a nonprofit, nonpartisan investigative news organization in Washington, D.C.\\r\\nKathryn Kranhold is a contributing reporter with the Center for Public Integrity and part of the Centers team writing about the economic effects of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\\xa0Kranhold is a former staff writer for\\xa0The Wall Street Journal, where she covered General Electric, utilities and anti-trust.

       "       'Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman is to arrive in Pakistan as soon as this week with the promise of billions of dollars in cash, subsidies and investment for the kingdom’s cash-strapped ally.\\r\\nHis expected visit, the exact date of which has yet to be confirmed, comes as Pakistan’s finance minister, Asad Umar, said his country had “come very close to having an agreement with the IMF” following talks on a multibillion support package between Prime Minister Imran Khan and the IMF’s Christine Lagarde in Dubai on Monday.\\r\\nAny agreement with the IMF would help to allay fears that the $14bn those planning the trip expect Saudi Arabia to pump in to Pakistan will come with strings attached. Some observers say Saudi Arabia could push for a more extreme form of Islam in the country and upset the delicate balance of power in the region. “The network of Madrassas across Pakistan has flourished with money from the Middle East with the largest chunk coming from patrons in Saudi Arabia,” one western diplomat explained.\\r\\nSaudi Arabia might have less sway than it would usually expect, however, because of US progress in talks with the Taliban about ending the war in Afghanistan. The negotiations, in which Pakistan’s role is vital, has given the country political clout that could make it less reliant on its conservative Sunni Muslim ally and give it more leverage with other potential sources of funding including China and the International Monetary Fund.\\r\\n“This is a new chapter for Pakistan,” said Vali Nasr, dean of the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University in Washington DC, who recently returned from a visit to the country. “Any Afghani settlement needs Pakistan. Pakistan is playing ball with the US and that means Pakistan is in a position to make demands as well.”\\r\\nIn addition, the economy is under less pressure today thanks to the decline in oil prices, which has slowed the pace at which Pakistan was running out of foreign exchange reserves. Pakistan’s currency has also dropped by around 30 per cent against the US dollar since late 2017, making the country’s exports more competitive. \\r\\n“Today, Pakistan is in a much better place economically than six months ago,” said Taimur Baig, chief economist for DBS in Singapore. “It will be pragmatic and end up taking a little from everyone.”\\r\\n“Today, everyone is talking to everyone,” added one Pakistani banker. “Pakistan is returning to the diplomatic fold.”\\r\\nStill, not everyone shares this more optimistic view of Pakistani prospects. Earlier this month, for example, Standard & Poor’s downgraded Pakistan’s long-term sovereign rating to “B-”, citing diminished growth prospects. “While Pakistan has secured financial aid from bilateral partners to address its immediate external financing needs, we believe that fiscal and external imbalances will remain elevated,” the agency said.\\r\\nSome analysts believe it is precisely financial aid from countries such as Saudi Arabia that has kept Islamabad from adopting reform measures that may prove painful in the short run but are necessary for longer-term stability.\\r\\n“Mideast funds only offer temporary liquidity support. While these could eventually generate both exporting capacity or reduced imports, the short-run impact will not be positive for Pakistan’s external position,” noted Johanna Chua, head of regional economics for Citigroup in Hong Kong in a report entitled “Kicking the Can Down the Road to the IMF”. “Mideast support is allowing the government to take more time to negotiate an IMF programme.”\\r\\nSaudi Arabia, however, remains a longtime ally of Pakistan. The Pakistan Army provides 15,000 soldiers to protect its royal family in exchange for $5bn annually, according to Mr Nasr. Moreover, there are about 1m Pakistanis working in the kingdom and hundreds of thousands more scattered throughout the UAE and Qatar — whose remittances have helped to narrow Pakistan’s current account deficit in recent years.\\r\\nPakistan has only about $8bn in foreign exchange reserves, enough to last it for about two months. The $14bn Saudi Arabia plans to commit includes $6bn in a loan to beef up liquid foreign reserves and in deferred payments for Saudi oil shipments to Pakistan. The remaining $8bn will go towards financing a multibillion-dollar refinery at Gwadar, a coastal city with a deep seaport near the Iranian border, according to senior government officials responsible for monitoring foreign investments in Pakistan.\\r\\n“They [Saudis] need friends now more than at any other time and Pakistan needs investments,” said retired Major General Mahmud Durrani, a former national security adviser.',\n",

       "       'Whole Foods is raising prices again. Amazon.com Inc.\\r\\n AMZN 0.18%slashed prices at Whole Foods after acquiring the natural grocer in 2017, aiming to counter its reputation for high costs. Now, pressure from consumer-product makers to cover rising costs for packaging, ingredients and transportation has led Whole Foods to raise prices on hundreds of products, according to internal communications viewed by The Wall Street Journal. The natural grocer raised prices this month on dozens of items from Dr. Bronners soaps to Häagen-Dazs ice cream, according to an email viewed by the Journal. A separate company email in December listed 550 additional price increases on products including crackers, olives and cookies. \\r\\nWhole Foods said in the December email that suppliers were charging more for those products due to inflation. The separate price increases this month followed the expiration of annual contracts to sell about 700 goods at low prices, Whole Foods said. Those contracts wont be renewed, the chain said, and the increases add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars a week in additional revenue. \\r\\nSeveral consumer-goods companies, including\\r\\nProcter & Gamble Co.\\r\\nand\\r\\nClorox Co.\\r\\n, have recently raised prices or pledged to do so, to offset the higher costs of raw materials and boost profits. Nearly half of 52 consumer-goods manufacturers surveyed recently by consulting firm Acosta raised prices last year.\\r\\nMondelez International\\r\\nand\\r\\nHershey Co.\\r\\nlast month said they would raise prices this year. \\r\\nThe inflation-based increases at Whole Foods range from 10 cents to several dollars, a price list reviewed by the Journal shows. Soaps, detergent, oils and nut butters have some of the highest increases. The average hike was 66 cents, according to the list. \\r\\nSupermarkets have resisted passing along the price increases amid intensifying competition in their industry. Some are starting to relent. California-based\\r\\nSmart & Final Stores Inc.,\\r\\na warehouse-style grocer, has received requests from hundreds of suppliers to raise prices and expects costs to continue to rise this year. Some supermarkets are also agreeing to stock new brands and sizes that bring food makers more profits.\\r\\nAt Whole Foods, a basket of 40 select items purchased from their stores cost $191 last month, according to the Telsey Advisory Group, up more than 3% from what the same basket of goods cost last fall. \\r\\nA Whole Foods spokeswoman said on Monday that some of the grocers suppliers have raised prices due to higher material, labor and freight costs. Whole Foods has passed along part of those increased costs and absorbed the rest, the spokeswoman said. The chain stopped selling nearly half of 700 products with expiring contracts and instituted new deals on 100 more, she said. Prices increased on about 50 of the 700 items, she said, adding that Whole Foods is now putting more items on sale, based on customer purchasing habits. \\r\\nWe also offer hundreds to thousands of sale items daily and were continuing to lower prices for all shoppers and Prime members, Whole Foods said on Monday, referring to Amazons subscription program. \\r\\nThe e-commerce giant began adding discounts at Whole Foods and free, rapid delivery from its stores for Prime members last year. Amazon raised Prime membership fees 20% to $119 last April.\\r\\nWhole Foods updates the discounts for Prime subscribers each week. New discounts for all customers are introduced less frequently, records show. \\r\\nSome customers said they have noticed higher prices at Whole Foods this year and feel discounts exclusively for Prime members are unfair.\\r\\nI am no longer likely to go to my local Whole Foods, said Will Armstrong, a 37-year-old software developer from San Francisco, who is not a Prime member.\\r\\nOther shoppers like the membership discounts. Prime promotions were the top reason 1,168 shoppers surveyed by data firm Numerator last fall gave for visiting Whole Foods more often.\\r\\nWhole Foods has raised prices on nine of\\r\\nHain Celestial Inc.s\\r\\nplant-based Dream beverages. Hain, a major supplier of natural and organic products to Whole Foods, said Thursday that higher costs contributed to its unexpected loss in its latest quarter. \\r\\n Michael Bronner, president of California-based Dr. Bronners, said the natural-products company is increasing the price of soaps it sells to Whole Foods,\\r\\nTarget Corp.\\r\\n,\\r\\nCostco Corp.\\r\\n,\\r\\nWalmart Inc.\\r\\nand other retailers by 3%. Prices for the organic, fair-trade coconuts used to make those products have risen recently, Mr. Bronner said, motivating him to pass the higher costs to customers. \\r\\nPeople may opt for smaller sizes but they usually come back, Mr. Bronner said. \\r\\nWhole Foods is raising prices on 18 Dr. Bronners soaps by up to several dollars per item, the grocers communications show. Prices for some Natures Way coconut oils are also rising by several dollars. A spokeswoman for Nestlé SA, Häagen-Dazss parent company, said list prices havent increased at Whole Foods, and the company doesnt oversee any price increases made by retailers. \\r\\nWrite to Heather Haddon at heather.haddon@wsj.com',\n",

Engagement is typically defined by interactions with content such as likes, comments, clicks or shares. Engagement rates can be found by adding up all engagements on a post, dividing it by follower counts and multiplying by 100. \\r\\nHennessy equates the audience element to buying an album from your favorite musician.

Nearly five years in, her self-published cookbooks account for more than 50 percent of her income. And shes seen more emails and diverse opportunities from marketing agencies in her inbox in the last year. In December, Royal Caribbean paid for her to go on a seven-day cruise to highlight their dining options.\\xa0\\r\\n\"My work with Royal Caribbean was specifically because of how engaged my audience is,\" Davis said. \"They really\\xa0noticed, \\'You actually talk to people and are having conversations\\xa0on a daily basis.\\'\"\\r\\nBrand payouts\\r\\nThe advantages for brands seem\\xa0obvious:\\xa0direct access to target audiences for a fraction of what they\\'d pay in the traditional space.\\r\\nContent creators routinely value their work at a much lower rate than marketing professionals expect to pay, according to marketing software company IZEA. In 2018, marketers surveyed said they estimated paying more than $3,000 for a sponsored video, while content creators expected to charge $471.\\xa0\\r\\nBecause influencers bake the creative costs of producing advertorial content into their fees, even the high end of influencer rates can seem like a deal.\\r\\nYou have to recognize that for a marketer to get that same photo from an ad agency, theyre going to pay 10 times that, said Ted Murphy, founder and CEO of IZEA. When someone from an ad agency takes a picture, theyre paying a food stylist, paying people for a recipe, shooting location, a photographer, a project manager and photographer rights. Thats why theres still a lot of room for growth here.\\r\\nAnd ROIs can be as much as 11 times that of traditional digital marketing like banner ads, Nielsen Catalina and influencer marketing platform TapInfluence found by tracking in-store sales\\xa0through loyalty cards.\\r\\nMuch of that is directly\\xa0attributed to the look and feel of sponsored posts, and the way they seamlessly blend with an influencer\\'s organic content.\\xa0\\r\\n\"A lot of these brands that are spending money with influencers are also spending money on paid media. And these brands are seeing much higher engagement rates, much higher ROIs on influencers, because content the influencer is creating is not looked at as an ad, it\\'s very much look at as content,\" said Krishna Subramanian, co-founder of Capitv8. \"People recognize the individual within the content as much more authentic and thats whats really driving that ROI.\"\\xa0\\r\\nPlatforms that connect influencers with brands (and vice versa) back up the effectiveness. IZEAs State of the Creator Economy report found that one in three consumers have purchased a product after seeing it used by an influencer. According to a 2017 study by Olapic, an influencer marketing platform, 31 percent of consumers said they have purchased a product or service based on a social influencer post.\\r\\nBut calculating exact returns can be tricky. Native platforms like Instagram provide only certain metrics, which don\\'t get at conversion rates.\\xa0\\r\\nMore: Report: Instagram designing \\'creator accounts\\' for artists, celebs and digital influencers\\r\\n\"What they dont show is how many people went into a store to make a purchase based on the influencers recommendation, or how many people bought the product or booked the hotel at a later time,\" Silberman said.\\r\\nSilberman says she screenshots direct messages from followers who buy\\xa0$300 face creams or\\xa0five-day honeymoons based on her recommendations.\\r\\nDannia\\xa0Hakki, founder + CEO of MoKi Media, a boutique PR firm, said it\\'s now routine to include\\xa0social media placements in press reports to clients, right next to outlets\\xa0like The Washington Post and Conde Nast Traveler.

It may also be its undoing.\\xa0\\r\\nFyre Festival, the ill-fated greatest party that never happened,\\xa0is often cited as the ultimate example of this dynamic.\\xa0The 2017\\xa0event back in the news this year after the release of two documentaries, Netflixs Fyre and Hulu\\'s\\xa0\"Fyre Fraud,\"\\xa0 was promised to be a luxury\\xa0experience before it\\'s epic implosion from mismanagement and fraud.\\r\\nOrganizers paid a bevy of celebrity influencers\\xa0to\\xa0shoot extravagant\\xa0promotional material\\xa0and\\xa0spread the word on social media, including a reported\\xa0$250,000 Instagram post from model Kendall Jenner. Most\\xa0did not follow Federal Trade Commission guidelines that require sponsored content to be clearly labeled as such, and have resulted in ongoing legal battles.\\r\\nThe FTC\\xa0issued educational letters to 90\\xa0influencers\\xa0in 2017 reminding them to follow the guidelines for disclosing endorsements. It sent 21 of those a follow-up warning letter citing specific posts that broke compliance.\\xa0The impact on influencers who do not heed the FTC\\'s warning could be dramatic, experts warn. \\r\\nBecause influencers build their audiences and reputations on content perceived to be authentic,\\xa0their followers expect that they are true supporters\\xa0of the brands they pitch and will disclose when a monetary action is involved.\\r\\nFrom the consumer perspective, its really challenging because the disclosures for most people arent very clear and ultimately that erodes the trust with the creator and erodes the trust with the brand,\"\\xa0said Murphy.\\xa0\"Thats the whole trick to this space. If all of a sudden theres no trust between consumers and people producing this content then overall effectiveness is going to plummet and there will be no opportunity.\\r\\nMurphy says theyre still seeing 30 percent of marketers asking influencers not to disclose sponsored content. In their State of the Creator report, they also found two in three consumers might unfollow an influencer if they suspect them of not disclosing a paid relationship.\\r\\nThere are a lot of people skirting the rules right now that dont understand the long-term\\xa0implications of what theyre doing, Murphy said.\\r\\nEvery influencer who spoke with USA TODAY stressed the importance of authenticity with their audiences, particularly when it comes to sponsorships.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\r\\nI make a point of being as transparent as possible with my followers about everything influencer-related because theres so much mystery surrounding this business,\" Silberman said.\\xa0\"During a Q&A on my story, someone asked me what influencers get paid for a post I thought about just telling everyone what my rates are for the sake of being honest, but I also didnt want to limit my ability to negotiate for future deals.\\r\\nSilberman says some brands are solely looking for quick hits. She turned down a skincare company she was unfamiliar with that didn\\'t want to wait for her to\\xa0test their products before completing the deal.\\r\\nTo me, it just felt like a transactional, inauthentic exchange.\\r\\nMany influencers interviewed said they\\'ll only work with companies\\xa0whose products they like and use without payment.\\r\\nJeanne Grey, who started her blog The Grey Layers in 2011 and now has 470,000 followers, said she saw\\xa0success after learning\\xa0to\\xa0say\\xa0no.\\r\\n\"I started seeing growth\\xa0when I\\xa0really found my aesthetic and mastered what kind of brands we wanted to align ourselves with, instead of saying yes to everything,\" Grey said. \"Initially it was like, \\'Everything works for us!\\' But\\xa0no, that\\'s\\xa0not necessarily true.\"\\r\\nThe Holy Grail: Real money moves, then your own brand\\r\\nInfluencers say developing long-term relationships with\\xa0brands\\xa0not only builds audience trust, but it\\'s also where they\\xa0can make real money moves.\\r\\nI would call it working smart instead of working harder. Better in quality instead of volume, Grey said.\\r\\nBrands often restrict influencers they\\'ve partnered with from subsequent work with their competitors, but if that exclusivity is costing the influencer potential deals, she can use it to negotiate an increase in her contract.\\r\\nIf theyre being offered $10,000\\xa0to do a Revlon campaign, then that means they cant work with competitors Almay or Covergirl. So youre like, \\'well, off of all of these brands I normally work with Im going to lose $50,000\\xa0in the next six months.\\' Now that brand has to pay you an extra $30,000, said Hennessy.\\r\\nInfluencers can also charge more depending upon the length of time brands want to use their content and how they use it. If that brand\\xa0wants to turn a video from the influencer into an ad on TV\\xa0or in stores, and run it for several weeks, that\\'s an\\xa0additional cost.\\xa0\\r\\nIf she was only charging $10,000\\xa0for campaign, then you add in usage and exclusivity, and she could easily walk away with $80,000. \\xa0\\r\\nAt the very top of the influencer pyramid sit traditional endorsement campaigns and ambassadorships, the likes that have long kept actors well-heeled as they pursue less lucrative passion projects. Those can include print ads, billboards, in-person appearances, TV commercials and the like.\\xa0\\r\\nIn 2017,\\xa0Bare Minerals reportedly paid\\xa0more than $500,000 for beauty YouTuber Ingrid Nilsen to be the face of two flagship foundations one of the\\xa0largest known contracts between a blogger and brand at that time, according to Women\\'s Wear Daily.\\xa0Hennessy says she wouldn\\'t be surprised if Nilsen could charge $1 million today.\\r\\nThose types of deals represent the gold standard but are still few and far between.\\r\\nWe may do, like, four\\xa0of those every year,\" said Lisa Filipelli, manager for\\xa0vlogger Amanda Steele and a\\xa0partner at\\xa0Select Management.\\xa0\"Theyre really hard to get.\"\\r\\nSteele\\xa0started on\\xa0YouTube when she was 11, signed with Filipelli at age 13 and now has 2.7 million YouTube followers.

       "       'In his first State of the Union address before a divided Congress, President Donald Trump called on Washington to work together for the good of the country. But he outlined few new policy ideas and no clear path for collaboration. (Feb. 6)\\r\\n AP\\r\\nFor years, Andrew Gehrt, of Greenville, S.C., bounced among several low- and mid-wage jobs in food services, retail and sales until he was laid off from a position as a sales rep for a water filter company.\\r\\nBut after being unemployed for a year, the 29-year-old landed a job in September as business development manager for a technology company, at a salary of about $60,000.\\r\\nI felt stuck, he says. Now, I have a very hopeful outlook for the next five to eight years.\\r\\nIn his State of the Union address last week, President Trump vowed the country can make its middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before.\\r\\nDespite economists longstanding laments of a shrinking, hollowed-out middle class, Trumps pledge didnt seem so quixotic, at least judging by recent history. The vibrant economy, juiced further by the Trump-led tax cuts and federal spending increases, has lifted employment and wages for workers at all levels, including the middle class. The manufacturing, construction and oil industries traditional middle-class bastions -- have enjoyed revivals the past couple of years. And the replacement of many middle-wage workers with technology has slowed.\\r\\nYet analysts say Americas middle class will soon resume its long-term decline, largely as a result of automation and the continued offshoring of factory jobs, unless policymakers take dramatic steps to alter that course.\\r\\nFor the first time in decades, the middle class isn\\'t shrinking.\\r\\n\\xa0(Photo: Getty Images)\\r\\nThe trend, left to its own devices, is going to get worse, says Richard Reeves, director of the Future of the Middle Class Initiative at the Brookings Institution. A growing, prosperous, confident middle class is no longer going to happen automatically.\\r\\nTax season tips: Tax refund advance loans are often too good to be true. Here\\'s what you should know\\r\\nMinimum wage: From California to New York, states are raising minimum wages in 2019 for 17 million workers\\r\\nJeff Bezos news: American Media lawyer denies attempt at blackmail, extortion of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos\\r\\nEconomist Adam Kamins of Moodys Analytics agrees, adding. I think its a major concern for the U.S. economy.\\r\\nMid-wage jobs, defined as paying $14.18 to $23.59 an hour, are expected to grow by 4.45 percent from 2018 to 2023, compared with\\xa0about 6.26 percent growth for both low- and high-wage jobs, according to a CareerBuilder study. Fifty-eight percent of jobs lost during that period will be mid-wage, the report says.\\r\\nMiddle class makes recent advances\\r\\nThe recent trend has been positive. Median U.S. household income which includes paychecks as well as Social Security, public assistance and investment income -- rose 1.8 percent to an all-time high of $61,372 in 2017, according to the most recent Census Bureau figures. That followed gains of 5.2 percent in 2015 and 3.2 percent in 2016. Yet after adjusting for inflation, that income roughly equaled the level in 2007, before the start of the Great Recession.\\r\\nIts making up for lost ground but it doesnt really get people ahead, says Elise Gould, senior economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.\\r\\nFrom 2010 to 2018, inflation-adjusted pay rose 1.5 percent for the middle quintile of workers based on earnings, compared with\\xa06.5 percent for the bottom quintile and 2.9 percent for the top, according to figures from Brookings and the Labor Department. That data defines mid-wage slightly differently than CareerBuilder.\\r\\nTop earners, who overwhelmingly have four-year college degrees, are benefiting from a job market that places a growing premium on higher skills, Reeves says. And low-paid workers have advanced as a result of state minimum wage increases and social safety net programs such as welfare and food stamps, say Reeves and Jay Shambaugh, director of Brookings Hamilton Project.\\r\\nMiddle-wage workers are, well, caught in the middle. Their struggles, Shambaugh says, have been compounded by well-known forces: the plunge in manufacturing employment as a result of both offshoring and automation; the sharp decline of unions that used to ensure higher wages for factory and other workers; stagnating teacher pay; and the meager growth of state and local government jobs amid budget cuts and depleted pension funds.\\r\\nHeres the good news: The fortunes of the middle class have brightened recently amid a strong economy and labor market. Employers added an average 223,000 jobs a month last year, up from 179,000 in 2017. And unemployment sank to a near-50-year low of 3.7 percent before ticking up recently, leaving businesses struggling to find qualified workers.\\r\\nWeve finally got to the point where firms are being forced to bid up for workers, so youre seeing a little bit more for the middle class, Shambaugh says. Average U.S. wages climbed\\xa03.3 percent in 2018 after being stuck at 2.5 percent to 2.7 percent for several years.\\r\\nTrump deserves some credit. His tax cuts and spending increases boosted economic growth by seven tenths of a percentage point last year to 3 percent, says economist Greg Daco of Oxford Economics. And Trump slashed hundreds of regulations on businesses, further bolstering corporate confidence along with investment and hiring, says Wells Fargo economist Mark Vitner. While the\\xa0initiatives also prompted\\xa0longer-term concerns such as swelling the budget deficit and dismantling consumer protections theyve sparked the labor market in the short term.\\r\\nAndrew Gehrt\\r\\n\\xa0(Photo: Handout)\\r\\nBefore he got his business development job, Gehrt says he noticed a surge in openings last year.\\xa0He has resumed dining out and is finally able to sock some money away so he can eventually buy a house.\\r\\nIndustries that employ middle-class workers in particular are benefiting. Manufacturers have added about 450,000 jobs since Trump took office, the largest two-year total in decades, amid an improving global economy and a rejuvenated oil industry. The number of factory jobs reshored, or shifted to the U.S. from overseas, by both American and foreign companies, hit a record 170,000 in 2017 and notched a still-strong 131,000 last year, according to the Reshoring Initiative, which tracks the data. Harry Moser, who heads the group, largely credits Trumps pro-business policies.\\r\\nThe oil and natural gas drilling sector itself added 11,000 jobs in 2018 while boosting pay nearly 4 percent as a result of a surge in oil prices for most of the year. And construction has added 1.8 million jobs since the housing recovery began in late 2011, with average pay increasing 3.6 percent last year.\\r\\nYet Kamins notes the near-term prospects for such middle-class jobs are mixed. Trumps trade war with China is expected to curtail factory employment gains this year. And oil prices have fallen sharply from their early October peak, though theyve rebounded from late December lows. And while the housing market is forecast to slow this year as a result of higher home prices and borrowing costs, mortgage rates have moderated since the Federal Reserve recently signaled it may not raise its benchmark interest rate\\xa0in 2019.\\r\\nOutlook for middle class bleak -- unless\\r\\nThe longer-term outlook for the middle class is dimmer. Manufacturers are likely to continue offshoring jobs in large numbers, with reshoring simply limiting the decline, Kamins says.\\r\\nAnd automation could wipe out up to 73 million jobs by 2030,\\xa0according to a 2017 McKinsey report. High-level workers have analytical and managerial skills that machines cant replace. And low-wage workers cost less and are often not worth supplanting with technology, the study said. Others\\xa0work in health care or other service industries that rely on human interaction.\\r\\nMiddle-wage jobs, in turn, are most vulnerable, the report says. Besides factory employees, that means\\xa0workers who originate mortgages,\\xa0do paralegal or accounting work, drive trucks and handle maintenance and repair. While some can be easily shifted to other tasks, as many as 54 million Americans will need to be retrained, the study says.\\r\\nReeves credits Trump for spending more on apprenticeships, but says government at all levels has fallen woefully short in rolling out programs to upskill workers, in many cases to work alongside\\xa0robots or artificial intelligence. The federal tax cuts and spending increases are substantially widening the deficit over the next decade, making it even tougher to devote more money for retraining, Reeves says.\\r\\nOther Trump administration policies also may squeeze the middle class. Trumps conservative appointments to the National Labor Relations Board and Supreme Court are likely to further hobble\\xa0unions, Shambaugh says. And while the tax cuts help middle-class Americans, the vast majority of benefits will go to the top 1 percent\\xa0of income earners, according to the Tax Policy Center.\\r\\nNew policies can change the dynamic, Shambaugh\\xa0and Reeves say, such as expanding the earned income tax credit to more filers\\xa0and reversing state funding cuts that have hurt public colleges. But such reforms need to happen soon, Reeves says.\\r\\nA robust, resilient and happy middle class is one of the things that makes America America, he says. If the middle class loses confidence...it \\xa0becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.\\r\\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Tuesday President Trump\\'s proposal for new middle income tax cuts is \"doable,\" though the plan \"may not surface for a while.\" (Oct. 23)\\r\\n AP\\r\\nRead or Share this story: https://URL',\n",
       "       'BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Finance ministers from smaller European Union states on Tuesday opposed a plan to limit governments’ power to block EU reforms on tax matters, in a move that further reduces the chances of introducing an EU levy on large digital firms. \\r\\nEU countries with smaller populations have for years blocked efforts to narrow loopholes that allow tax evasion and in some cases even money laundering in the bloc. \\r\\nMany of them defend their right to decide their own tax laws and attract foreign business by offering sweeteners. \\r\\nIn an attempt to break the deadlock, the EU executive commission proposed last month to gradually remove the veto power that states wield on the overhaul of tax rules. \\r\\nBut at the meeting in Brussels, Luxembourg, Malta, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Sweden called for maintaining their veto power. The opposition of only one of them would be sufficient to block the planned overhaul in the whole 28-nation bloc. \\r\\nThe Commission had proposed to gradually move to majority voting on some minor tax issues, but crucially permitted states to decide on this structural reform by unanimity. \\r\\nThe Commission, led by Luxembourg’s former prime minister Jean-Claude Juncker, declined to use a neglected rule that would allow tax reforms to be adopted by a majority, a move that could have effectively ended the veto power when competition is distorted. \\r\\nLuxembourg’s Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna was among the most vocal of those against the reform proposed by the Commission. He told reporters that to preserve the unanimity on tax decisions was “extremely important”. \\r\\nThe tiny state wedged between Germany and France for years blocked EU anti-tax evasion rules that require the exchange of information on bank accounts held by foreign citizens. \\r\\nIt is also one of the staunchest opponents to the introduction of a common tax base in the EU that would limit countries’ power to offer sweeteners to large corporations. \\r\\nOther smaller states, led by Ireland, have blocked a common tax on digital revenues. This has pushed several countries, including France, Italy and Spain, to adopt similar levies at national level, despite risks this could weaken the EU market. \\r\\nA new attempt for a watered-down EU-wide digital tax could be made in coming weeks, but has little chance of succeeding. \\r\\nIn proposing an EU-wide digital tax last year, Brussels said the levy was needed to restore fair competition in the bloc and end practices that allow large multinationals such as Google, Facebook or Amazon to cut their tax bills by moving their continental profits to low-tax countries such as Luxembourg or Ireland. \\r\\nGermany and France, the two largest states in the EU, supported the commission’s plan to decide by majority on some tax matters. In a joint news conference with his French peer, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said the reform was needed to improve decision-making in the EU. \\r\\nReporting by Francesco Guarascio; Editing by Alison Williams',\n",

       "       'How compatible are fashion and tech? \\r\\n It\\'s a question that\\'s been increasingly asked as both billion-dollar industries eye potential ways to cash in on the other. Upon first glance, it may seem obvious the two are interwoven: iPhones line the front rows of fashion shows now more than ever before. \\r\\n At Christian Siriano\\'s runway show Saturday during New York Fashion Week, we saw the pairing in full force ... kind of. \\r\\n The designer, from Project Runway fame, teamed up with global software giant SAP to feature a \"live-voting\" app, where attendees and remote viewers could \"like\" and \"love\" the various looks in real-time. \\r\\n Siriano\\'s show at 30 Rockefeller Plaza drew celebrities, influencers, and industry elites. Before taking the elevator 67 stories up to The Top of the Rock, where the show was held, attendees passed SAP employees handing out flyers for the Runway App. Many just walked right on by, totes and tiny sunglasses in tow. \\r\\n A few days before the show, 360-degree photos are taken of each look (Siriano had 57), which helps the app\\'s machine-learning tools recognize the outfits through a phone\\'s camera as they come down the runway day of. The app then prompts the user to give it a thumbs up or a heart. \\r\\n As of right now, there is no \"see now, buy now\" feature, though SAP sees it as a potential asset later. \\r\\n Yet, it\\'s what the app offers to designers that may be its best quality: Designers can also use the Runway App to go back and review the feedback data to determine what could work in department stores as consumers head to the racks. According to SAP, the app helps \"brands to increase margins by understanding what\\'s loved in real-time and avoid investment in unpopular designs.\" \\r\\n The primary capacity of SAP\\'s Runway App for users is the favoriting feature. But how is that any different than taking a photo of a look that stands out to you? \\r\\n The app is attempting to break a convention already set in stone, one rather already simplistic nonetheless, in the fashion world: the camera function. Why go through an app when you can merely swipe left on your iPhone\\'s home screen? A fashionista\\'s camera roll is already a collection of her favorites. Without the \"see now, buy now\" option, the app\\'s appeal to the average runway attendee seems uncertain. \\r\\n Not to mention, SAP\\'s Runway App design is rather primitive in nature and battery-draining: I had to quickly shift to low-battery mode during Siriano\\'s show while using the app and ended up with 1% at the end. For someone attending more than one show, this would be a buzzkill. \\r\\n Similar to how the fashion houses experiment with new looks during fashion week, SAP seems to be doing the same thing with its software — trying to better understand how to appeal to consumers while helping out the businesses behind the experience. The company did not immediately respond when asked how many people used the app during Siriano\\'s show Saturday. \\r\\n Whether stars like Christina Hendricks, Mariska Hargitay, or Deborah Messing, who were in attendance, were using the Runway App is unknown... but seems unlikely. Unlike the rest of the attendees, their phones remained relatively out of sight. \\r\\nTake a look at how SAP\\'s Runway App works:',\n",

       "       '(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own)\\r\\n* Chartbook: https://URL\\r\\nLONDON, Feb 12 (Reuters) - U.S. sanctions on Venezuela\\'s state-owned oil company are tightening the global oil market and sending refiners around the world scrambling to find replacements for the country\\'s diesel-rich heavy and extra heavy crudes.\\r\\nVenezuela\\'s heavy crudes, such as Merey, have few close substitutes, with the nearest being grades such as Brazil\\'s Marlim, Mexico\\'s Maya, Canada\\'s Bow River and Cold Lake, or Iraq\\'s Basra Heavy.\\r\\nMost of those crudes have an even higher sulphur content than Venezuela\\'s, which will require extra processing to make fuels of acceptable quality, and in any event the quantities are limited in the short term.\\r\\nVenezuela sanctions have arrived in a market that was already likely to be short of medium and heavy crudes because of U.S. sanctions on Iran and OPEC\\'s output cuts.\\r\\nThe major oil exporters in the Middle East Gulf (Saudi Arabia, Iraq, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iran) market mostly medium and heavy crudes.\\r\\nU.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, together with OPEC\\'s output cuts, have therefore removed mostly medium and heavy oils from the market, leaving lighter grades relatively unaffected.\\r\\nThe result is that prices of medium and heavy crudes have surged relative to their lighter counterparts since the middle of January.\\r\\nMars, a medium crude grade from the U.S. Gulf, has moved to a rare premium over Louisiana Light Sweet. Oman, another medium crude, has moved to a premium over Brent, a light one.\\r\\nDECADES OF FAILURE\\r\\nVenezuela has the world\\'s largest proven oil reserves, amounting to around 300 billion barrels, ahead of Saudi Arabia on 265 billion and Canada at 170 billion (\"Statistical review of world energy\", BP, 2018).\\r\\nBut the country\\'s oil industry has been in relative and absolute decline for the last 50 years as problems of producing and marketing its heavy crudes have been compounded by an unattractive investment regime and mismanagement.\\r\\nVenezuela\\'s crude production slumped from 3.8 million barrels per day in 1970 to just 1.7 million bpd in 1985, recovering to 3.4 million bpd in 1998 before slumping again to 2.1 million bpd in 2017.\\r\\nVenezuela accounted for 16 percent of OPEC output and 8 percent of world production in 1970 but those percentages had fallen to just 5 percent and 2 percent respectively by 2017 (https://URL\\r\\nThe country\\'s very dense crudes, some of which barely float on water, are complicated to process and sell for a large discount compared to other producers.\\r\\nProduction has been hampered by corruption, political interference and lack of foreign investment and technology to maintain existing fields and develop new ones.\\r\\nLike Iran, another founding member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Venezuela\\'s oil industry has been blighted by mismanagement, unrest, political instability, diplomatic isolation and sanctions.\\r\\nOutput has gone into free fall as the country\\'s isolation has increased, shrinking from 2.4 million bpd in 2016 to 2.0 million bpd in 2017 and 1.5 million bpd in 2018, according to the Joint Organisations Data Initiative.\\r\\nVenezuela was once a major oil exporter to the United States, but shipments have fallen from 1.4 million bpd in 1998 to around 500,000 bpd in 2018 (\"Petroleum supply monthly\", EIA, Jan 2019).\\r\\nVenezuela\\'s diminished importance in the global oil market and as a supplier to the United States has emboldened the U.S. administration to take a tough approach in attempting to oust the government of Nicolas Maduro.\\r\\nSanctions announced last month prohibit U.S. corporations and persons from financial transactions with state-owned oil company PDVSA.\\r\\nThe U.S. Treasury\\'s guidance, which appears deliberately unclear, has left many third-country buyers uncertain about whether they can do business with PDVSA without also falling foul of sanctions.\\r\\nHEAVY OIL SHORTAGE\\r\\nThe U.S. administration likely calculated any fallout from sanctions on oil prices would be small given the limited volumes of crude involved and the expectation that the standoff would be resolved quickly.\\r\\nBut while Venezuela\\'s crude now accounts for a very limited share of the global oil market, it plays a much more important role in the niche market for heavy crude.\\r\\nVenezuela accounted for 1 million bpd of heavy-sour crude production out of a worldwide total of 7 million bpd in 2017 (\"World Oil Review\", ENI, 2018).\\r\\nHeavy crudes are much harder to refine and tend to contain significant quantities of sulphur and other impurities that are costly to remove, which is why they sell at a hefty discount to medium and light oils.\\r\\nFor refineries that have invested in delayed coking units, however, heavy crudes can yield large volumes of middle distillates (gasoil, diesel and jet fuel).\\r\\nMiddle distillates are used mostly in freight transportation as well as manufacturing, mining and farming, and are particularly valuable late in the business cycle when economic activity is near to the peak.\\r\\nMid-distillates are especially prized at the moment with the forthcoming introduction of new bunker fuel regulations by the International Maritime Organization from the start of 2020.\\r\\nIn effect, sanctions have shifted the balance of global oil production in the direction of lighter crudes, at the same time that the economy and forthcoming regulations are pushing refinery demand towards heavier grades.\\r\\nThe sudden embargo on Venezuela\\'s exports has therefore sent refiners in the United States and elsewhere scrambling to find alternative supplies compatible with their equipment.\\r\\nIf refiners are unable to source enough heavy and extra heavy crude, they will buy the next best alternative, in this case medium density crudes, so the impact of sanctions is rippling through the entire oil market.\\r\\nRelated column:\\r\\n- OPEC cuts make global crude supply lighter and sweeter (Reuters, March 17, 2017) (Editing by David Evans)',\n",

       "       'Costco can be a great place to find good deals on the foods you eat every day. But there are a few areas where your local grocery store or a big box store like Walmart and Target can offer better value for your money.\\r\\ndiv &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child\"&gt;\\r\\nThat\\'s especially true when it comes to size. Because Costco generally sells products in bulk, to get the most out of your purchase, you need to make sure you can consume the larger quantities of a product before it goes bad. For ordinary families or individuals, that can be a high bar to clear.\\r\\nThat\\'s primarily why Charlene Haugsven, founder of MyFrugalAdventures.com, tells CNBC Make It, \"Just because Costco has it doesn\\'t mean it\\'s a bargain.\"\\r\\nHere are the eight types of groceries she and other experts suggest that the average shopper should think twice before buying in bulk at Costco:\\r\\nBreakfast cereal\\r\\nGround coffee\\r\\nCondiments and sauces, such as soy sauce\\r\\nFlour\\r\\nMilk\\r\\nEggs\\r\\nFresh fruits and vegetables\\r\\nSpices\\r\\nIf you compare these items, especially the Kirkland brand, to similar products you\\'d find at the grocery store simply on price, Costco usually wins. However, the reason grocery experts put these items in the \"don\\'t buy\" category comes down to the size.\\r\\nThe containers or packages are simply too big to end up being a good value for the average person.\\r\\nSure, some folks with big families, an extra freezer or lots of pantry space may think these are a good deal. In many cases, though, you\\'ll end up throwing a good portion of the food away or struggle to find room for it in your home.\\r\\n\"A normal family is just never going to get through the quantity you have to purchase,\" Haugsven says. That\\'s especially true on items like soy sauce, spice mixes and produce. If you live by yourself, springing for Costco\\'s 1-pound container of fresh spinach, for example, may not make sense, though it is a steal at $4.99. That\\'s because, even if it\\'s stored properly, fresh spinach will usually only last 5 to 7 days in the refrigerator, according to shelf-life guide site StillTasty.com.\\r\\nLarge quantities can also be unwieldy to store. Though grocery stores usually sell flour in 5-pound sacks, Costco sells it in 25-pound packages, and it can be difficult to find space for all of that. \"I would never want to store 25 pounds of flour. That\\'s a whole year\\'s worth of flour in advance,\" Haugsven says.',\n",
       "       'Robert Mueller, then the FBI director, arrives for a speech at the bureau\\'s headquarters in 2009. (Brendan SURL News)\\r\\nWith Joanie Greve and Mariana Alfaro\\r\\nTHE BIG IDEA:\\xa0Americans across the partisan divide believe strongly and overwhelmingly that special counsel Bob Muellers final report on his investigation should be made public in its entirety, and a 56 percent majority trusts Muellers version of the facts more than President Trumps, according to a new Washington Post-Schar School poll.\\r\\nThe survey finds that 81 percent of adults nationally believe Muellers report should be released, including 79 percent of Republicans. Overall, 64 percent of respondents said they feel strongly that the report must be made public. Just 15 percent think it should not be published.\\r\\nThese numbers are striking because Trumps attorney general nominee, William Barr, who is poised to be confirmed by the full Senate this week on a largely party-line vote, has pointedly declined to commit to releasing Muellers report. Barr has said his goal will be to provide as much transparency as he can consistent with the law, but hes also said that Muellers conclusions will be handled as a confidential document and emphasized that Justice Department guidelines discourage the disclosure of negative information about people who are not being charged with crimes. (DOJ guidelines say that a sitting president cannot be indicted.)\\r\\n-- The new poll finds that a 61 percent majority of Americans would support Congress impeaching the president and trying to remove him from office if Muellers report says Trump authorized his 2016 campaign to coordinate with the Russian government. That includes 29 percent of Republicans. Overall, 33 percent would oppose impeaching Trump even if Mueller finds that Trump authorized collusion with Russia, which the president vigorously denies, including 67 percent of Republicans and 30 percent of independents.\\r\\n-- Right now, 51 percent approve of Muellers handling of the investigation, with 34 percent disapproving. Thats essentially unchanged from a similar question asked a year ago. Meanwhile, 35 percent approve of Trumps response to Muellers investigation, with 52 percent disapproving. There are a significant number of people keeping an open mind about what the report will ultimately conclude, said Mark Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University, which partnered with The Post on the poll.\\r\\n--Attitudes toward Trump and Mueller contrast sharply with views of President Clinton and Ken Starr before the independent counsel released his report 20 years ago, Scott Clement and Matt Zapotosky note: An August 1998 Post-ABC poll found 61 percent of Americans said Starr was mainly interested in hurting Clinton while 35 percent said he was mainly interested in finding the truth. The new poll finds views of Mueller are flipped in the positive direction, with 57 percent saying he is mainly interested in finding the truth compared with 36 percent who say hes mainly interested in hurting Trump. Both polls today and in 1998 show people who affiliate with the presidents party overwhelmingly see investigations as politically motivated, but independents lean differently this year. A 57 percent majority of independents think Mueller is mainly interested in finding the truth, compared with 1998, when 59 percent of independents thought Starr was mainly interested in causing political damage to Clinton.\\r\\n-- The publics desire for transparency and Barrs unwillingness to promise hell provide it sets the stage for a potentially titanic clash between Congress and the executive branch in the months to come.\\r\\nLowell Weicker, who as a Republican representing Connecticut was a member of the Senate Watergate Committee, says Congress must be willing to go to the mat to force the release of the report if Barr stonewalls. This decision should not be left to the attorney general alone, even if it means using congressional tools from subpoena power to the appropriations process to make the report public, Weicker, now an independent, wrote in an op-ed last week. I dont know what Mueller has found or will find But I know that if the president is as innocent as he has argued from day one, then he should want Muellers report to be public and transparent, rather than rebutted and censored as Rudolph W. Giuliani, the presidents lawyer, has suggested he will do.\\r\\nThe Posts Editorial Board has endorsed legislation introduced by Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Dick Blumenthal (D-Conn.) that would require public reports from Mueller and every other subsequent special counsel. The Special Counsel Transparency Act would require that a report be sent to Congress at the conclusion of an investigation or within two weeks of a removal, transfer, or resignation. It would need to include all factual findings and underlying evidence.\\r\\nThe Mueller probe is not just another criminal investigation, an editorial noted\\xa0over the weekend.\\xa0It is also an inquiry into a foreign attack on the nations democratic system, the details of which are the publics to know, and an inquest into official malfeasance at some of the highest levels of government. If the air can be cleared, it must be. To be clear, not every potentially unflattering detail Mr. Mueller dredges up needs to be on the record. But core conclusions and evidence must be. And because special counsel investigations are rare and involve serious questions of official wrongdoing, the public will have a similar interest in transparency in later special counsel probes, as well. The bill should pass and quickly.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost\\'s morning briefing for decision-makers.Sign up to receive the newsletter.\\r\\nThe Post-Schar School poll was conducted by cell and landline telephone Feb. 6-10 among a random national sample of 841 adults and has an overall margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.\\r\\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\\r\\n-- Former NASA astronaut Mark Kelly announced this morning that he will challenge Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) next year. Kelly is married to former congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who survived an assassination attempt in 2011. Watch the video he posted on Twitter:\\r\\nA DEAL IS REACHED:\\r\\n--\\xa0Key lawmakers reached a tentative\\xa0compromise\\xa0last night to avoid another government shutdown at the end of the week.\\xa0Hurdles remained, and Trumps ultimate backing was in doubt after quick opposition emerged from conservatives,\\xa0Erica Werner, Damian Paletta and Sean Sullivan\\xa0report:\\r\\nThe deal includes $1.375 billion for 55 miles of fences along the border, compared with $5.7 billion Trump had sought for more than 200 miles of walls. The deal omits a strict new cap Democrats had sought on immigrants detained within the United States as opposed to at the border. At the same time, it limits overall levels of detention beds maintained by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, although GOP aides said ICE would have enough money and flexibility to maintain its current detention levels and add more when needed. ...\\r\\nWhite House officials were reviewing the terms of the deal, and [Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.)] said he was hopeful Trump would be supportive. But Fox News host Sean Hannity, a Trump confidant, immediately called the shutdown deal a garbage compromise. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus who talks regularly with Trump, said that it fails to address serious threats. ... At a rally in El Paso on Monday night, Trump told a crowd of supporters that he was briefed on the conference committees progress as he was walking onstage. Just so you know were building the wall anyway, Trump declared to the audience.\\r\\n-- Nancy Pelosi signed off on the agreement, per House Appropriations Committee Chairman Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.).\\xa0\\r\\n-- This deal would fund all government operations through September.\\xa0\\xa0\\r\\n-- If a shutdown still occurs on Friday night, though, the administration reassured Americans yesterday that\\xa0they will still get their tax refunds. CNNs Donna Borak reports: If funding lapses again on Friday, the IRS will follow [a] contingency plan put in place in January, including a revised protocol to accommodate the tax filing season.\\r\\n-- Trump and potential 2020 candidate Beto ORourke staged dueling rallies in El Paso last night. In a meandering, 75-minute speech, Trump tried to paint an image of crime and lawlessness on the border while claiming falsely that violent crime went down in El Paso after a wall was built, Philip Rucker, Toluse Olorunnipa and Jenna Johnson report. Pausing to listen to chants of Build that wall!, Trump sought to correct his supporters: Now, you really mean finish the wall, he said, claiming that his promised border wall was already under construction. He referred to ORourke several times during the rally, calling the former congressman a young man whos got very little going for himself.\\r\\nAbout a mile down the road, several thousand demonstrators gathered at a high school carrying American flags, rainbow banners, Beto for President flags, and flags for Mexico and Texas. There were also signs decrying Trump and his border wall such as Trump made America hate again and chants from the crowd that included Make tacos, not walls!\\r\\n-- A Trump supporter attacked a cameraman during the presidents rally, per the BBC: Sporting a Make America Great Again cap, the man shoved and swore at the BBC\\'s Ron Skeans and other news crews before being pulled away. Mr Skeans said the very hard shove came from his blindside. Mr Trump saw the attack and confirmed Mr Skeans was well with a thumbs up after it happened. A campaign official for Mr Trump afterwards suggested the attacker was drunk.\\r\\nMore than 50 polar bears have come ashore on an Arctic archipelago in northern Russia, causing chaos.

(Stephanie KURL Images)\\r\\nTHERES A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\\r\\n-- The National Enquirers parent company, American Media, sought advice last year from the Justice Department over whether it should register as a foreign agent after publishing a magazine celebrating the Saudi crown prince. The Wall Street Journals Julie Bykowicz and Lukas Alpert scoop: The company told Justice Department officials in the letter that although it followed the editorial and photography suggestions of [an adviser to the Saudis], it wasnt under any contractual obligation to do so. The publisher also told the Justice Department that it didnt receive any foreign money to produce the magazine. Based on those assertions, the Justice Department said the media company didnt need to register as a foreign agent, noting that conclusion could change if the facts in the matter are different in any way from those depicted in your submission.\\r\\n-- Former White House aide Cliff Sims is suing Trump after the presidents attorneys\\xa0claimed Simss new book violated a nondisclosure agreement. Josh Dawsey and Felicia Sonmez:\\xa0Mark Zaid, a lawyer representing Sims, said [Trump] is trying to use a nondisclosure agreement from the campaign to punish Sims for discussing his time in the White House. ... The lawsuit accuses Trump of having his campaign serve as \\'an illegitimate cutout and step into the shoes\\' of the government in an attempt to silence Sims, in violation of his First Amendment rights. ...\\xa0It claims that the U.S. government, \\'for the first time ever through the use of private surrogates, is seeking to unconstitutionally censor and punish a former federal employee for disclosing unclassified information outlining what he saw and observed during his time in the White House.\\' ... Sims signed an NDA during his time working for the Trump campaign but does not know whether he signed an additional White House agreement regarding \\'confidential\\' information, according to the lawsuit, which states that Sims is operating under the assumption that he did sign such a document.\"\\r\\nTHE NEW\\xa0CONGRESS:\\r\\n-- Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) apologized after a number of her Democratic colleagues, including Pelosi, rebuked her over a tweet widely criticized as anti-Semitic. Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade report: The Minnesota congresswomans Sunday evening tweet Its all about the Benjamins baby, a reference to $100 bills drew immediate denunciations from Republicans and fellow Democrats, especially Jewish members of Congress. Within hours, [the speaker] and the leadership issued a joint statement calling Omars use of anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israels supporters deeply offensive and insisted on an apology. In response, Omar said her intention was never to offend my constituents or Jewish Americans as a whole. This is why I unequivocally apologize. The firestorm exposed deep divisions within the Democratic Party over the unquestioned U.S. support of Israel, pitting long-standing Democratic backers of the Jewish state against the partys newest lawmakers and several 2020 presidential candidates who have spoken out in favor of Palestinian rights.\\r\\n-- Rookie mistake: The publication and subsequent retraction of a fact sheet from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezs office about the Green New Deal\\xa0has given ample fodder for the president and conservatives to mock her resolution and the 2020 Democrats who have endorsed it. Jeff Stein and David Weigel report: Ocasio-Cortezs staff posted online and sent to reporters a list of frequently asked questions about the Green New Deal. Those pages included language and policies not included in the resolution itself such as providing economic\\xa0security to those unwilling to work and ruling out nuclear power as part of the solution to the climate crisis. None of the lawmakers or candidates signed off on the FAQ, which was prepared by Ocasio-Cortezs staff to explain the separate Green New Deal resolution but was accidentally released prematurely with unfinished language. The confusion over the document complicated the rollout of the Green New Deal plan, as more than a dozen media outlets, particularly in the conservative media, reported on policies in the FAQ page that the co-signers of the resolution have not agreed to support.\\r\\n-- Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) said he would no longer put his assets in a blind trust despite doing so for eight years as governor. The Tampa Bay Timess Steve Contorno reports: Scott said Monday that instead he will report his assets to the public in annual financial disclosure forms required of all members of Congress. Scott, the former head of a health care company before a scandalous exit, was the wealthiest governor in state history. His state financial disclosure report filed late on a Friday evening last June showed Scott had a net worth of more than $232 million at the end of 2017.\\r\\nRICHMOND IS REELING:\\r\\n-- Four members of his staff\\xa0resigned after Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D) refused to do so himself following two sexual assault allegations against him, leaving him with a skeleton crew as he fights for his survival.\\xa0Laura Vozzella, Gregory S. Schneider and Fenit Nirappil have the latest:\\xa0An attempt by Del. Patrick A. Hope (D-Arlington) to introduce articles of impeachment against Fairfax was shut down by House Democrats after an emotional conference call Sunday night, in which they debated the proper procedure and viability of such a plan, given that the alleged offenses which Fairfax describes as consensual did not take place during his tenure as lieutenant governor The law firm where Fairfax has been a partner since September, Morrison & Foerster, has hired an outside firm to conduct its own investigation into the allegations, and Fairfax has taken a paid leave of absence while it is pending. ...\\r\\nMembers of the Black Caucus, who have called on [Ralph] Northam to step down, said the first test of the governors rhetoric [that he is now committed to racial justice] is the spending plan the biggest legislation they face this year. And, they said, it doesnt measure up. Where Northam had initially proposed increasing the amount of Earned Income Tax Credit returned to low-income working families, the compromise deal eliminates that idea. The budget proposals tied to the package are stingier in many categories that affect low-income and minority communities ... With that, all 16 members of the Black Caucus voted against the tax bill, joined by a handful of other Democrats to deprive it of the 80 votes needed to go into immediate effect ...\\r\\nMembers of the Black Caucus met with Republican leadership including Speaker Kirk Cox (R-Colonial Heights) and eventually swung around and supported the House version of the bill. But they said they did so only after securing verbal commitments to pursue funding in the state budget for areas that affect low-income and minority populations. That could happen either through amendments to the budget bill, the tax bill or in budget negotiations between the two chambers.\\r\\nNeomi Rao testifies during her confirmation hearing last week. (Zach GURL Images)\\r\\nTHE #METOO MOVEMENT:\\r\\n-- Neomi Rao, Trumps nominee to replace Brett Kavanaugh on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,\\xa0apologized for her controversial writings about date rape in college that gave some Republican pause. Seung Min Kim reports: In a letter Monday to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Rao condemned \\'sexual assault in all forms\\'\\xa0as \\'abhorrent\\' and stressed that she \\'particularly regret[s] the insensitivity demonstrated in my remarks on rape and sexual assault.\\'\\xa0She said that in college, she was \\'sheltered\\'\\xa0and that her perspective on the issue evolved as she grew more mature and became a mother to two children. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), who recently disclosed her own experience with sexual assault and expressed hesitation about Rao, said she felt a lot better after sitting down with her. I havent made that firm commitment yet [on her nomination], but Im just glad to know where she stands, and it allayed a lot of fears, Ernst said.\\r\\n-- The family of Barry Myers, Trumps nominee to lead the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, paid a $290,000 fine after a federal agency found that their company, AccuWeather, subjected female employees to sexual harassment and a hostile work environment. Myers is the former chief executive of AccuWeather. Michael Brice-Saddler reports: The agreement alleges that AccuWeather did not exercise reasonable care to prevent and correct the improper treatment and harassment against women there. AccuWeather denies the allegations of harassment in the letter. However, as part of the agreement, the company promised to institute a number of changes including mandatory in-person training for managers in how to identify and prevent unlawful harassment.\\r\\n-- The Cleveland Browns have signed Kareem Hunt, the running back who was cut by the Kansas City Chiefs last year because he shoved and kicked a woman. Mark Maske reports: Its not clear when Hunt, 23, will play for the Browns. He faces a potential suspension without pay by the NFL next season under its personal conduct policy. We fully understand and respect the complexity of questions and issues in signing a player with Kareems history and do not condone his actions,\\' Browns General Manager John Dorsey said ... We believe he deserves a second chance but certainly with the understanding that he has to go through critical and essential steps to become a performing member of this organization.\\r\\n-- The sexual abuse scandal within the Southern Baptist church has prompted calls for criminal investigations and drawn comparisons to the Catholic Church.Julie Zauzmer and Marisa Iati report: The truth is that this is a cultural problem, said Marci Hamilton, the chief executive of anti-abuse nonprofit organization CHILD USA. It goes across every single organization where any adult has had access to children alone. No prosecutor at this point could possibly believe there are parts of society where this didnt happen. It did. Alabama and Mississippi, two states with the largest concentration of churches in the Southern Baptist Convention, have some of the shortest limitations on prosecuting child-sex crimes, Hamilton said. Neither state has a large Catholic population, so the Southern Baptist investigation may bring more pressure to change those laws.\\r\\nJoe Biden speaks at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. (Rick BURL\\r\\n2020 WATCH:\\r\\n--\\xa0Iowa Democrats inched closer to adopting a new, optional tele-caucus that would vastly grow the number of people who vote in the states caucuses.\\xa0Matt Viser reports: The state party plan, which still must pass muster with the Democratic National Committee, marks the most significant change to the caucus process since its inception in 1972 and seems likely to complicate the campaigns strategies. Although party officials dont have estimates, the move could significantly increase the number of voters involved. Not all of the details have been sorted out, but party officials say the voting will take place over a phone or smart device. Party leaders have been conscious of any change that would make the caucus seem like a primary, which would provoke officials in New Hampshire, where state law requires them to hold the nations first primary. Iowa Democrats checked their proposal by New Hampshire before announcing it.\\xa0\\r\\n-- Recalling Bernie Sanderss boasts of his average 2016 contribution being $27, Democratic candidates are fighting to build the strongest small-dollar donor bases. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: Historically, these early low-dollar contributions were viewed largely as a sign of grass-roots support and an indication of potential voter enthusiasm. But that has changed in recent elections as small contributions have increasingly filled the coffers of many candidates providing the fuel that allows them to be viable contenders. Being able to raise a lot of money from a lot of small donors is now a test not only of a candidates ability to tap this source of funds, but to go head-to-head against [Trump] and his army of grass-roots donors.\\r\\n-- Many Democratic strategists are expressing skepticism about Joe Bidens possible presidential bid. McClatchys Alex Roarty reports: McClatchy interviewed 31 Democratic strategists pollsters, opposition research experts, media consultants, ex-party officials, and communications specialists from across the country about a potential Biden campaign. Strikingly, these conversations yielded a similar view: The Democratic political community is more broadly and deeply pessimistic about Bidens potential candidacy than is commonly known. While these strategists said they respect Biden, they cited significant disadvantages for his campaign from the increasingly liberal and non-white Democratic electorate to policy baggage from his years in the Senate and a field of rivals that includes new, fresh-faced candidates. We heard it with Hillary, and we saw it happened, [one Pennsylvania-based Democratic strategist said]. And theres a lot of reason to think he would wind up a significantly weaker candidate than Hillary.\\r\\n-- If Biden decides to run, his wife, Jill, could become his most important surrogate. From Roxanne Roberts: After Trump was elected, it looked like the Bidens might finally retire from public life. They bought a $2 million house in Rehoboth. They established foundations on global diplomacy and cancer research. But the siren song of the White House, that ultimate and elusive prize, still calls to Joe. According to those closest to the Bidens, he really wants to run. Jill never aspired to be first lady Ron Klain, former chief of staff to Joe when he was vice president, says Jill would be a critical asset in the campaign. Klain says she connects with people in an authentic way as an advocate for education and especially military families.\\r\\n-- New York City Mayor\\xa0Bill de Blasio is heading to New Hampshire as he considers a 2020 run.Politicos Sally Goldenberg reports: De Blasio is ... soliciting City Hall staffers with national political experience and preparing to travel to the early primary state of New Hampshire this week. \\xa0There he will meet with Mayor Jim Donchess and may chat with locals at a diner... De Blasio has repeatedly said he is not ruling out a run and has long sought a national platform. But City Hall officials have privately lamented a de Blasio push for a higher national profile, worried it would generate negative headlines and distract de Blasio from his day job.\\r\\n-- Sen. Amy Klobuchars Republican colleagues have praised her dealmaking abilities but have also expressed concern that such praise might hurt her chances. Politicos Burgess Everett and Marianne Levine report: In a Democratic caucus filled with presidential hopefuls taking a hard line against [Trumps] presidency, the Minnesota senator\\'s brand of pragmatic politics stands out. And numerous Republicans are raving about Klobuchar her personality, her respect for the other party, even her competitiveness in a general election. In fact, a dozen GOP senators were so effusive in interviews this month that some worried they might damage her candidacy in a Democratic nomination fight that has many candidates embracing the partys left flank.\\xa0CNN will host a town hall with Klobuchar in New Hampshire next Monday.\\r\\n-- Klobuchar also became the latest Democratic candidate to say she would reject corporate PAC money. From CNBCs Brian Schwartz: Klobuchar has been no stranger to contributions from corporate PACs during her runs for Minnesota\\'s Senate seat. In her 2018 re-election campaign, she raked in just under a quarter of her total haul from PACs, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.\\r\\n-- A split has emerged among Democratic 2020 candidates over\\xa0whether to pursue Obama-esque hope and optimism or prepare for an all-out fight against Trump.\\xa0The New York Timess Alexander Burns reports: Down one path, [Cory] Bookers, lies a mission of healing and hope, with a campaign to bind up social wounds that have deepened in the Trump era. The other path, [Elizabeth] Warrens, promises combat and more combat a crusade not just to defeat Mr. Trump but to demolish the architecture of his government. It is perhaps not an accident that the most confident Democratic tribunes of good feeling are all men, while the partys sternest warriors are mainly women. In a contest for the presidency, a position traditionally viewed in martial terms, it may be easier for a man of Mr. Bidens backslapping swagger or Mr. Bookers athletic stature to show tenderness or vulnerability without fear of appearing weak.\\r\\n-- Kirsten Gillibrand said the first Womens March pulled her out of a deep depression after Trumps election. Now, as a woman, for women is the main theme\\xa0of her 2020 campaign.From the Timess Lisa Lerer and Shane Goldmacher: By using her gender to find a toehold in the Democratic electorate, Ms. Gillibrand risks pigeonholing herself in a race where voters may be seeking a broader populist message. There may well be a risk, Ms. Gillibrand said, in what she calls her women plus campaign platform. But it is who I am. I think the country would be so much stronger if women had greater voices. There is no real precedent for Ms. Gillibrands strategy: As a candidate, Hillary Clinton struggled to talk about her gender, and essentially tried to copy the approach of the male presidential candidates who had preceded her.\\r\\n-- Tommy Hicks Jr., a longtime friend of the presidents family who became chair of the pro-Trump groups America First Policies and America First Action, has been named co-chair of the RNC. BuzzFeed Newss Tarini Parti reports: Coordination rules governing how much outside groups can communicate with the campaign and elected officials had been limiting Hicks relationship with the president. In his new role, Hicks can now be more directly involved and play a larger role, especially with the presidents 2020 campaign creating a structure in which the RNCs operations are intertwined with its own. The setup is shaping up to be dramatically different from the 2016 election when the campaigns relationship with the RNC was more of a forced merger, Hicks said.\\r\\nSen.

So I was born in Oakland, and raised in the United States except for the years that I was in high school in Montreal, Canada, Harris responded with a laugh.

Bezoss\\xa0allegations\\xa0the National Enquirer sought to extort and \"blackmail\" him could increase pressure on Congress to pass legislation to criminalize sharing graphic photos without the subjects consent.\\r\\nSome federal lawmakers have been trying for years to pass legislation to crack down on nonconsensual pornography the distribution of private, sexually explicit images without the permission of those featured and sometimes colloquially referred to by law enforcement\\xa0as revenge porn or sextortion.\\r\\nRep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) tells me in the coming months, she plans to reintroduce legislation cracking down on nonconsensual pornography, which was co-sponsored in 2017 by Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.).\\r\\nThe more people that are impacted by this vicious conduct will hopefully give us the traction we need to get some laws on the books that create the criminality of this, Speier said.\\r\\nThough the distribution of nonconsensual pornography is an increasingly common issue, the circumstances surrounding Bezos are highly unusual. Last week, the Amazon chief accused the Enquirer of threatening to publish graphic photos, including one he said an executive at the tabloids parent company referred to as a below the belt selfie, unless Bezos halted an investigation into how the company obtained private messages between him and his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez.\\xa0\\r\\nCurrently, 42 states and the District of Columbia have laws on the books criminalizing the distribution of nonconsensual pornography. But the current patchwork of laws varies dramatically state by state, and some states have very weak protections for victims, said Mary Anne Franks, the president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, a non-profit focused on fighting online abuse. \\r\\nSpeier said comprehensive federal legislation is needed given the damage this issue can cause to victims lives.\\r\\nTheres no question that Bezos is in a rare position to be able to fight the release of such graphic material given his wealth\\xa0and notoriety. But regular folks dont have those advantages even as ubiquitous smartphones and web cameras make it easier than ever to snap and potentially abuse intimate photos.\\r\\nHes not at anybody elses mercy, said Carrie Goldberg, a victims\\' rights attorney in Brooklyn, New York. He had the privilege of being able to call out his blackmailer. But I have a lot of clients who cant.\\r\\nIn the\\xa0defiant Medium post where he published alleged emails from executives at Enquirer parent company American Media Inc., Bezos acknowledged his advantages. If in my position I cant stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can? Bezos wrote in a Medium post outlining the allegations.\\r\\nOne in eight social media users have been the targets of nonconsensual pornography, according to a 2017 report from the nonprofit Cyber Civil Rights Initiative. They are more likely to be female than male, according to\\xa0Franks.\\r\\nTechnology companies themselves say they\\xa0have been cracking down on the practice in recent years, and advocates said they worked with the companies to develop legislation they would support. Both Twitter and Facebook supported the legislation Speier co-sponsored, called the ENOUGH Act, when it was introduced in 2017.\\r\\nBut the legislation stalled amid opposition from civil liberties groups that raised concerns the bill could have a chilling effect on free speech. And they have opposed bills across the country with broad language limiting nonconsensual pornography because of the impact it could have on images that might have news value or be of historical interest.\\r\\nSpeier is confident she is in a better position to pass legislation during this session of Congress, especially with Democrats in control of the House.\\r\\nWe have strong values around privacy rights as a party, she told me.\\r\\nA Lime electric scooter in Los Angeles on July 9, 2018.

When they do, the investigation into Russian election interference stands\\xa0to breach an unusual milestone: bringing in more money than it has cost.\\r\\nBut first, lawyers working for special counsel Robert Mueller must reach a deal with another set of opponents, including the Trump Tower condo board.\\r\\nA handful of banks the Trump Tower Residential Condominium Board have lined up to argue that they\\'re entitled to parts of the properties and\\xa0investment accounts\\xa0valued at about $26.7 million\\xa0that the former Trump campaign chairman has been forced to give up as part of plea agreement with Mueller\\'s team. Included in the package of New York real estate is a $7.3 million compound in the Hamptons and a $3.8 million apartment in Manhattan\\'s Trump Tower.\\r\\nMany of the claims could be resolved as early as this week, according to court documents.\\r\\nWhen they are, the investigation Trump has dismissed as a witch hunt and a waste of money will more or less have paid for itself. Mueller\\'s probe has posted costs of about $25 million so far. Exactly how much the government stands to collect will turn on how much of his property must be turned over to banks and others, and to New York\\'s fluctuating real estate market.\\xa0\\r\\nIn addition to Manafort\\'s fortune, the government stands to collect about $1.9 million from other people charged as a result of Mueller\\'s investigation.\\xa0\\r\\nFormer Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort leaves the federal courthouse after a status hearing in Washington this year.\\r\\n\\xa0(Photo: SHAWN THEW, EPA-EFE)\\r\\nPatrick Cotter, a former federal prosecutor who oversaw complex organized crime cases, said the leftover money, while substantial, represents \"icing on the cake for the government whose overriding priority\\xa0is always a conviction.\"\\r\\n\"Rarely is there money sufficient to make a big recovery,\" said Cotter, who is not a party to the Manafort case.\\xa0\\xa0\"It\\'s only when all the fighting is over involving the banks, family and every other creditor do your really know what the leftover assets are really worth.\"\\r\\nAmong those picking at the multi-million-dollar leftovers:\\xa0\\r\\n\\xa0Citizens Bank in New York has reached a deal with federal prosecutors for the possible recovery of up to $3.2 million in loans on a Soho apartment owned by Manafort, pending its sale by the government..\\r\\nAt Manafort\\'s August trial on financial fraud charges, prosecutors offered evidence\\xa0that he had falsified the loan application, including inflating his income by $1.5 million.\\xa0A mortgage loan assistant at Citizens later testified that even as Manafort presented the application for the property listed as a second home, she found the same apartment\\xa0listed for rent during an online search. (Manafort stood to obtain a better loan rate by classifying the property as a second home.)\\r\\n\\xa0Under a separate agreement with the government, a property management firm linked to the same Soho property stands to collect more than $2,500 in in back condo fees, dating to last fall.\\r\\n\\xa0The Chicago-based Federal Savings Bank, whose chief executive expedited approval of $16 million in loans for Manafort after he and the former Trump campaign chief discussed a possible role in the Trump administration, is seeking to claw back some of the loan\\'s proceeds. Two of Manafort\\'s New York properties, the Hampton compound and a $4.1 million Brooklyn brownstone, were offered as collateral for the loan package, which is now in serious default. The claim is pending.\\r\\nTrump Tower in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City, shown on March 16, 2016, has 58 floors of offices and condominiums, including 263 residential units.\\r\\n\\xa0(Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP)\\r\\n\\xa0The assistant secretary of the Trump Tower condo board asserted an interest in the anticipated sale of unit 43G, which once served as the Manaforts\\'\\xa0stylish\\xa0pied-a-terre in New York. The board, according to court documents, seeks an undisclosed amount in uncollected condo fees related to the property that once established Manafort and his wife as neighbors of the president. Separate property listings for the apartment show condo fees of about $2,000 per month.\\xa0\\r\\n\"Any sale of a residential unit in the condominium is conditioned on the claimant being paid all common charges due on a residential unit as of the date of conveyance,\" the board said in a court filing.\\r\\nIn court documents, prosecutors said they were in possible settlement discussions with the board, and that a resolution could be reached as soon as this week.\\xa0\\r\\n\\xa0In one of the more obscure disputes, a federal judge has given a general contractor until March 8 to support his claim for $585,991.85 related to work on Manafort\\'s Brooklyn brownstone.\\r\\nProsecutors have argued that the claim lacks \"standing\" and should be dismissed.\\r\\nManafort was found guilty of fraud and other charges by a federal court in Virginia, and pleaded guilty to related charges in another federal court in Washington. He hasn\\'t been sentenced in either case, but has already agreed to give up a chunk of his fortune that he gained through illicit lobbying work for a pro-Russian faction in Ukraine.\\xa0\\r\\nThat fortune\\xa0represent by far the bulk of fines and fees assessed against all targets in the Mueller inquiry so far.\\r\\nMichael Cohen, the president\\'s former personal attorney; Richard Gates, former Trump campaign deputy; Michael Flynn, former Trump national security adviser; George Papadopoulos, former campaign foreign policy adviser; and Alex van der Zwaan, a Dutch attorney whose firm was linked to Manaforts work, all have been either assessed fines and fees or face financial penalties related to their convictions in the Russia inquiry and related investigations.\\r\\n\\xa0Exactly how the final balance sheet for Mueller\\'s investigation will even out\\xa0may not be fully known for months. Trump has used the investigation\\'s price tag\\xa0 albeit an inflated one\\xa0 to disparage the inquiry as a \"witch hunt.\" He falsely claimed that its costs had topped $40 million.\\r\\nWhen will this illegal Joseph McCarthy style Witch Hunt, one that has shattered so many innocent lives, ever end-or will it just go on forever? After wasting more than $40,000,000 (is that possible?), it has proven only one thing-there was NO Collusion with Russia. So Ridiculous!\\r\\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 29, 2018\\r\\nDavid Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor who handled international drug trafficking and fraud cases, said it would be \"unusual\" indeed to hope than any investigation as complex as Mueller\\'s could turn a profit.\\r\\nIn (most) fraud cases, while there may be forfeitures, most of that money first goes towards restitution, Weinstein said.

So the ability of hedge fund people, various people — they aren’t paying that ordinary income rate.\\r\\nThe one thing that never gets much press — the IRS shows the statistics for the top 400 people of the highest income and the rate they pay. Anyway, you should look at that. It’s about a 20 percent rate, so it has nothing to do with the 39.6 marginal ordinary income rate. So it’s a misfocus. If you focus on that, you’re missing the picture.\"\\r\\nGates, who stepped down from leading the software giant in 2006 to focus on the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, added that there are politicians who are so extreme with their policy proposals, that they would start to create tax dodging and certain disincentives, while causing \"income to show up in other countries and things.\"\\r\\nThe tech titan did concede that taxes \"can be more progressive,\" including issues such as the estate tax and the tax on capital, the way the FICA and Social Security operate. \"We can be more progressive without really threatening income generation — what you have left to decide how to spread around,\" Gates said.\\r\\nBill Gates\\r\\n (Â©2016 American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.

To be the first to know, please click here.\\r\\n Multiple former Toys \"R\" Us executives are working for a new company called Tru Kids that\\'s planning a comeback for the toy retailer, according to CNBC. Following Toys \"R\" Us\\' bankruptcy in 2018, some of its lenders took control of its brand names and other intellectual property, and Tru Kids now manages those brands. \\r\\nBusiness Insider Intelligence \\r\\nTru Kids\\' plans for Toys \"R\" Us are still developing, and could see it open stand-alone stores, pop-up locations, or partnerships where Toys \"R\" Us\\' private labels and branding appear at other retailers, similar to what Toys \"R\" Us\\' lenders did at Kroger this past holiday season. \\r\\n The comeback is focused in the US since Toys \"R\" Us still operates overseas, and Tru Kids is aiming to provide better technology and in-store experiences to try to avoid some of the troubles that led to Toys \"R\" Us\\' bankruptcy. \\r\\n But Toys \"R\" Us will be returning to a different landscape with heightened competition since several retailers stepped up to try to take its place over the holidays. Retailers including Amazon, Walmart, and Target bolstered their toy offerings during the holidays in the hopes of capturing the market share left behind by Toys \"R\" Us. \\r\\n So, Toys \"R\" Us will have to rebuild its image and consumer base while competing with powerful retailers that are more engaged in its industry. And because of Toys \"R\" Us\\' liquidation, those retailers now have stronger e-commerce capabilities and larger brick-and-mortar networks, making a successful comeback a difficult task. \\r\\n If Tru Kids can rebuild Toys \"R\" Us, there\\'s a valuable opportunity for it to succeed as a year-round toy retailer. \\r\\n The major retailers that have upped their investment in toys aren\\'t going to keep it up outside of the holiday season. The holidays are the most lucrative time for toy retailers, but Toys \"R\" Us still racked up nearly $6.5 billion in sales in the first three quarters of 2017, so there\\'s plenty of value in the industry all year. And competitors that aren\\'t exclusively toy retailers aren\\'t committed to having huge inventories of toys year-round, potentially leaving consumers in a lurch. If Toys \"R\" Us returns as a full-time toy retailer and has a big enough reach, it may be able to reestablish itself outside of the holiday season, when there\\'s less competition, which could drive holiday success too. \\r\\n Toy manufacturers have seen their sales drop despite increased interest from other retailers, potentially making working with a reborn Toys \"R\" Us attractive. Manufacturers may be hesitant to work with Toys \"R\" Us after its bankruptcy, but with top players like Hasbro and Mattel seeing their sales drop in the all-important holiday quarter — 13% year-over-year (YoY) and 5% YoY, respectively — they might be more willing to give it a chance. And they may be particularly excited about a year-round retailer, as it would give them more opportunities to make sales, so Tru Kids would be wise to consider making a push beyond the holidays.',\n",
       "       'Tikkudak is the latest poultry-based import from Korea, a country that loves its fried chicken as much as anyone south of the Mason-Dixon line. A month ago, I couldnt have told you a thing about tikkudak. Two weeks ago, I would have given you incomplete and even conflicting information about the dish. Today, I can tell you a story about the misbegotten way tikkudak has been introduced to Washington.\\r\\nMy first taste of the fried chicken came last month at Choong Man Draft House in Columbia Heights (3115 14th St. NW, 202-797-7227), in the space formerly known as the Heights Taproom. The menu describes tikkudak whether wings, tenders or whole bird as chicken thats fried, then baked in a charcoal oven for extra crisp and crunch. Its basically a smoky twist on Korean fried chicken, those crackly, hopelessly addictive wings that get not one, but two dunks in the deep fryer.\\r\\n[The ultimate guide to the best fried chicken sandwiches in the D.C. area]\\r\\nThe first wings that crowded my Choong Man-branded plate radiated smoke in all directions. I could have paraded that plate down 14th Street and, within seconds, every barbecue hound within a block radius would have followed me to the gates of hell, the pied piper of smoke. As I laid waste to those wings each one sticky and hot with sauce, if slightly soggy I was imagining an all-out Korean fried chicken war in Washington. Who would win out? Choong Man or BonChon?\\r\\nBut several days later, I bounced into the very same Choong Man and was immediately confronted with a mystery: My order of tikkudak, this time coated in soy-garlic sauce, was almost smoke-free, even when I placed a drumette centimeters from my nostrils. Frustrated, I marched to the open kitchen and started interrogating the cooks, who initially suggested they were still using the charcoal oven to finish the fried chicken. But when I pressed, they confessed. They were spraying the birds with liquid smoke. They showed me the bottle.\\r\\n[Here come the BonChon imitators]\\r\\nThis confession forced me to reflect on my first batch of tikkudak and an experience that I had initially dismissed as nothing more than the side effect of chicken that spends just a few minutes in the charcoal oven: Before I had finished the wings, they had lost almost all their smokiness. Armed with new information, I formulated a different theory: that the liquid smoke had simply evaporated. Whatever the cause, I wasnt happy with the bait-and-switch of my Choong Man visits.\\r\\nThis might be a good place to provide some context. In South Korea, fried chicken has become a national obsession in the decades since KFC thats Kentucky Fried Chicken entered the Korean market ahead of the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. Most of the fried chicken consumed on the peninsula is not done inside the American chain, but in eateries that specialize in chimaek, a two-fisted pairing of chicken and beer. The combination is buried in the word itself: Chimaek is a multicultural portmanteau of chicken and maekju, the Korean word for beer. According to a 2017 story in Bon Appétit, more than 30,000 joints serve chimaek at the time in South Korea, each one trying to distinguish itself by some small variation in cooking method, sauce or seasoning.\\r\\nChoong Mans specialty is tikkudak as well as a dish the chain calls snow chicken, which is merely fried chicken covered in a sweet, mayo-based sauce and countless ringlets of sliced raw onion, which are briefly dipped in cold water to mask their more sulfurous odors. The snow chicken is good more than good, really especially if you pair it with a piquant curry sauce. But the tikkudak is my current obsession, perhaps not surprising given my own affection for barbecue.\\r\\nBut what, exactly, is tikkudak? For that definition, I turned to Danny and Jean Lee, the siblings who helped launch Mandu in 2006 near Dupont Circle. As we sat in the Choong Man Draft House, picking over two plates of chicken, Danny and Jean broke down the word: Tikku, they theorized, is the phonetic mash-up of two Korean words twigim, which means fried, and gui, which means grilled. Dak, as those who have visited a certain Shirlington restaurant know, means chicken in Korean.\\r\\nBy definition, then, tikkudak should be fried and grilled or, in this case, briefly smoked in an oven designed by chain founder Choongman Park, who has more than 200 outlets in South Korea. But as I discovered in my visits to three Choong Man locations in the metro area, some kitchens have apparently abandoned the smoking procedure. In fact, at the H Street NE outlet of Choong Man (1125 H St. NE, 202-399-6010), an employee tried to convince me the charcoal-grilling step is not part of the original recipe. I should note that Lucy Sesay, manager at the Choong Man Draft House, told me, Were going back to using our smoker.\\r\\nSo why would some of these outlets seemingly be undermining the very chain that provides them with sauces, seasonings and recipes? A chain thats still trying to establish an identity in the American market? One theory is money: You can burn through a lot of charcoal in a short amount of time, and thats not cheap. But as I learned from an owner of a Choong Man location in Northern Virginia who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk on behalf of the chain the Washington outlets are not technically franchises. Theyre independent restaurants that merely buy ingredients from Choong Man. The chain has apparently not yet established a U.S. subsidiary, which means there is no official oversight for the at least six locations in the Washington-Balitmore region.\\r\\nIt is, in short, a free-for-all at Choong Man outlets here, which explains why there is so much variation among menus. The H Street location also sells stuffed fish, steamed crabs and raw oysters. The Draft House location serves up spicy ramen, bibimbap and even a burger.\\r\\nIf you want to experience Choong Man as the founder intended it, you need to hit the location in the Fairfax area. There may be others, but I know this spot at least strives to maintain the chains standards.) The Fairfax kitchen relies on Royal Oak hardwood lump charcoal to fuel its oven. Once your chicken emerges from the fryer, its slathered in your preferred sauce and then placed in the charcoal oven for about 2 ½ minutes. Theres no mistaking the flavor. The wings are smoky, but the flavor is more than the pure concentrated aroma of liquid smoke. Underneath the smokiness, there is, quite literally, the taste of fire.\\r\\nExcept when theres not. The second time I ate at the Lee Highway spot, I barely detected smoke on the wings. I mentioned this later to general manager Hye Young Lee, who said she occasionally has to remind cooks to add more charcoal to the oven. She said she can usually spot an undersmoked plate of wings on its way to the table, but clearly she cant be on-site every second of every service.\\r\\nCorporate oversight, it seems, cant come fast enough for Choong Man Chicken in America.

Most of that money was wired or sent with gift cards.\\r\\nFederal data also show that people between the ages of 40 to 69 have the highest rates of romance scams.\\r\\nOne woman told NBC News that she was swindled following her divorce.\\r\\nConnie, who asked her real name not be used for fear of embarrassment, said she began looking for love on the online dating site Plenty of Fish.\\r\\n\"I met this guy and he was supposed to be a doctor and so he was very charming, he had the whole set up, pictures with the dog, his house on the beach,\" Connie said. \"And so we talked for about a week or two weeks.\"\\r\\nBut what appeared to be a connection turned into a con. The man said he was taking a work trip abroad, and that\\'s when his actions became suspicious: He began asking Connie for money.\\r\\n\"He said you can send me $100 on (an) Amazon card,\" she said.\\r\\nSuch requests for money, however, should be an immediate red flag, according to the FTC.\\r\\n\"You know as long as that spigot is on and there\\'s a little bit of money coming through to these folks, they\\'re going to keep trying to get some of that money,\" Vaca said.\\r\\nScammers often use similar tactics to pull at heartstrings. The FTC said creative tales of emergencies and misfortune requiring financial assistance are common. Any plans to meet in person, however, never transpire.\\r\\nFurther investigation typically reveals the swindler\\'s profile is phony, the FTC said.\\r\\n\"When they take those photographs and they do a Google image search on those photographs, they\\'ll find that photo, and they will see it with someone else\\'s name,\" Vaca said.\\r\\nConnie fell into that exact trap.\\r\\n\"I couldn\\'t find him.

       "       'As COO of The New York Times, Meredith Levien oversees advertising and circulation revenue, which has been the big growth story recently. The Times just hit 3.4 million digital subscriptions and 4.3 million total subs, including print, and set a goal of passing 10 million subscriptions by 2025. \\r\\n But while President Trump (who has mocked the paper as the \"failing New York Times\") contributed heavily to the growth of the Times and other news outlets after the 2016 election, Levien said the Times is no longer reliant on the \"Trump bump,\" as other stories gain attention and it invests in stories no one else is doing. \\r\\n \"At this point, the president is no longer driving our subs,\" Levien told Business Insider. \"We\\'re still in a very strong news cycle. Investigations will continue to get a substantial amount of investment. That\\'s the kind of work I don\\'t think anyone is doing at scale.\" \\r\\n She also talked about getting people to pay at the higher end, the Times\\' relationship with distribution platforms, and why she\\'s not worried about competitors heavily discounting subscriptions. \\r\\nHere\\'s our conversation, edited and condensed:\\r\\nLucia Moses: The Times got a big subscription boost in part with a $1-per-week deal it\\'s been running. Is there any concern that people will drop off once the promotion ends? \\r\\nMeredith Levien: We\\'re about six months into that offer, and retention is pretty good. We don\\'t publicize our retention rate, but it\\'s gotten substantially better. We\\'ve had a number of people come in at 50% off who we had to step up to full price, and that went really well. We\\'re getting better at how we onboard you and interact with you in the first 90 days. We\\'re still not as good as the best subscription companies out there, but we\\'re a lot better than we were, and that gives us confidence we should be able to retain at whatever offer we get people in at. As we get better at the product we\\'re also making it more valuable. I don\\'t think there are a lot of places in news where you can say that. \\r\\nMoses: Where does the Times need to get better? \\r\\nLevien: We have three big areas of investment. We added 120 new journalists in 2018 and we will continue do that. Investigations will continue to get a substantial amount of investment. Things like the story of Trump\\'s family wealth and taxes. That\\'s the kind of work I don\\'t think anyone is doing at scale. Everything about how tech is transforming the world and we\\'ll keep covering that. There\\'s a presidential election and we\\'ll continue to invest in how we cover politics. Climate remains a giant story and we see that as a really important area to put fresh investments. \\r\\nRead more: The New York Times is betting big on Amazon Alexa as voice assistants take hold in US households\\r\\n We\\'re making big investments in the customer journey and user experience. From the moment someone hits a New York Times story on Facebook or Google, we\\'re doing more to explain the access model. We\\'re putting a lot of energy and thought into our app. That\\'s not been an area we\\'ve been focused on. \\r\\nMoses: Trump has been a big subscription driver. How do you think about continuing growth once the Trump era ends? \\r\\nLevien: A couple things. We felt very confident in the second half of the year and at this point that the president is no longer driving our subscriptions. We\\'re still in a very strong news cycle. Tech, climate change — these are really big stories that are getting a lot of attention. So we feel pretty confident that as we invest in politics and stories beyond politics, we\\'ll see meaningful engagement at the Times. \\r\\nMoses: Why did the Times set a goal of subscriptions rather than subscription revenue? \\r\\nLevien: The first goal was to double digital revenue in five years. We\\'re well ahead of that. We\\'re a $1.7 billion public company, and we need to grow revenue and need a certain amount of profitability to invest in the business. So implied in the 10 million is we will do that in a way that will make the Times a healthy and successful company. \\r\\nMoses: How does it impact the Times\\' ability to charge with more publishers getting into online subscriptions and often heavily discounting? \\r\\nLevien: We are making a market for subscription journalism and you don\\'t make a market by yourself, so it\\'s really, really good that there are many, many getting into the space. A healthy, ascendant Washington Post, a strong Wall Street Journal are good for a healthy, ascendant New York Times. That said, how do we think about others discounting more aggressively? I think what we do is fundamentally different and worth paying more for. We\\'ve been much more aggressive with brand marketing than anyone who be considered a close competitor. So I\\'m not terribly worried about where anyone else prices their subscriptions. The Post has done extraordinary reporting on politics, The Wall Street Journal has done extraordinary reporting on business, but I don\\'t think there\\'s anyone other than The New York Times that pursues the truth and does our breadth of work. I\\'m not sure we have a peer. \\r\\nMoses: You\\'ve begun dynamic pricing of subscriptions. Do you see a point where you have people paying at all kinds of levels? \\r\\nLevien: We really see room on both sides of the demand curve. We\\'ve been testing the lower half. That\\'s worked and reached an audience for whom the price before felt too high. At same time I think there\\'s a large number of people who would pay whole lot and will pay a whole lot for The New York Times. All-digital access is $125. We have a lot of people who take that. We have people paying over $1,000 a year for The New York Times. I think there are probably people in the world who would pay $100,000 for a subscription because they believe so much in it. It\\'s a business challenge to identify people who would pay a lot and get it to them in a way that makes sense. We\\'re putting lot of thought into how to get at the high end of the demand curve. We\\'ll test higher prices. We\\'ll put out more product. We keep putting more value in the paper. \\r\\nMoses: What\\'s working on platforms and where is there room for improvement? \\r\\nLevien: We continue to have productive relationships, with some more than others. We\\'ve spent lot of money with Facebook, Google, Twitter, building our audience with subscribers. All of that said, we\\'re most focused on The New York Times as the best place to experience journalism. On Google, we like what they\\'re doing, the tool set they built with Subscribe with Google. \\r\\nMoses: And Facebook and Apple News, which have or are working on subscription products? \\r\\nLevien: I don\\'t think we\\'ll comment on that. We are at the moment most focused on our own model and user experience. I don\\'t think we\\'ve talked publicly about whether we\\'ll participate in [Apple News subscription service] Texture. Apple News, like Google and Facebook and to some degree Twitter, continue to be one of a handful of important sources of people discovering a story first from the Times. \\r\\nMoses: How do you assess the digital news landscape now, which has been dominated by a lot of layoff stories? \\r\\nLevien: It\\'s really unfortunate and upsetting that we\\'re losing so many jobs in journalism. I think that is not good for the world. What is going well is: journalism is finding its way into new places in people\\'s lives. As we find ways to get into stories and find new formats like audio where we can do news in a more narrative, interesting way, I think there\\'s an opportunity for high-quality journalism to play a bigger role in people\\'s lives. \\r\\n The Daily is a success for so many reasons but it really invented this new form of narrative news. The format is intimate. The special sauce wasn\\'t just the story but understanding how the story came to be and the story behind the story. It gives people a sense of how we do the work we do. We\\'ll keep making The Daily bigger and we\\'re very focused on what other shows and special events we can launch through it. Caliphate was one example. We\\'ll do multi-episode specials and grow shows out of audio.',\n",

       "       'This story was delivered to Business Insider Intelligence \"Digital Media Briefing\" subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider. To be the first to know, please click here.\\r\\n Amazon is launching a live-streaming video version of a home shopping network called \"Amazon Live,\" according to TechCrunch. \\r\\nBusiness Insider intelligence \\r\\nThe new live-streaming offering will feature live video shows hosted by Amazon talent as well as by individual brands, which will be able to broadcast their own shows live via a new app called Amazon Live Creator, launching as part of the initiative. The shows will talk viewers through products for sale on Amazon, which will be shown in a carousel underneath the video streams. \\r\\n Amazon Live highlights how the tech giant is expanding the integration of e-commerce and digital video on its platform. Although Amazon is first and foremost an e-commerce platform, it\\'s likewise a powerful streaming video provider. \\r\\n With its legacy e-commerce business and its growing focus on original programming for Prime Video, Amazon is strongly positioned to drive purchases on the back of digital video content. This isn\\'t the first time Amazon has tried selling products through video on its platform. In 2016, Amazon launched \"Style Code Live,\" which ran live on the platform on weekday evenings, though was canceled after 15 months. \\r\\n With its newest announcement, the e-tailer has merchandising efforts in the works across three different types of digital video - live-streaming, unscripted reality, and scripted shows. In addition to Amazon Live, Amazon is also reportedly developing a shoppable competitive fashion reality series that will be hosted by fashion gurus Heidi Klum and Tim Gunn of TV\\'s \"Project Runway,\" though that show is expected to be exclusive to Prime members, while Amazon Live shows are available to anyone who visits the site or app. The e-tailer is also reportedly working on a scripted series with A-list actress Blake Lively that will feature a merchandising element. \\r\\n Brands that partner with Amazon on the new live-streaming venture stand to boost discoverability, customer acquisition, and conversions all in one fell swoop. Brands will not only find central placement in front of Prime\\'s global membership of 100 million subscribers in more than 200 countries, but will be accessible to non-members as well. \\r\\n Further, because video content is viewed on the e-commerce platform itself, Amazon creates a more streamlined path to purchase directly from the point of engagement with content. Amazon has an increasingly central role in the consumer online purchase journey: Almost 90% of Amazon\\'s product views come from the platform\\'s own product search, rather than advertising, merchandising, or product aggregators, per Jumpshot.',\n",

It was later revealed that he was wanted by the FBI for\\xa0a string of incidents involving food tampering at various Safeway grocery stores and Targets in California and Arizona.\\r\\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, Lohr allegedly poured bleach into several\\xa0supermarket\\xa0freezers, which contained dairy products, frozen seafood, ice and alcohol, in the neighborhoods of Redondo Beach, Manhattan Beach, West Los Angeles, West Hollywood and Sunnyvale.\\r\\nCALIFORNIA MAN ACCUSED OF STABBING PERSON AT MOTEL SEEN SMILING IN MUGSHOT\\r\\nAfter being apprehended in Santa Clara following the bus incident last week, deputies found that the substance he was spreading was salt. Although\\xa0Lohr left the scene, they later discovered him at a different bus stop with\\xa0receipts from Safeway stores stuffed in his pockets. Upon further investigation, employees at a nearby Safeway told police\\xa0they discovered an empty hydrogen peroxide bottle in a rotisserie chicken tray late last month. Surveillance footage reportedly\\xa0showed Lohr pouring bleach over a carton of eggs at the same store.\\r\\nAuthorities are trying to determine if the tainted products were sold to any customers.\\r\\n“To date, there have been no known reports of individuals sickened by Lohr’s actions; however, further investigation has determined that Lohr has done this in a variety of stores, and the extent of his actions are currently under investigation,” FBI officials said.\\r\\nLohr's bizarre crimes were first realized last October in Phoenix, when he was arrested for bleaching products at six Target stores. While in jail for those offenses, Lohr reportedly spoke with Fox 10, telling them that he poured bleach on the products at Target in an attempt to clean the chemicals off of them.\\r\\n“I did nothing wrong,” Lohr told Fox 10. “I committed no crime. Absolutely no crime.”\\r\\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\\r\\nAfter being released from police custody, he failed to appear in court for the alleged Phoenix incidents, and has been considered a fugitive since then.\\r\\nRecords show that Lohr is no stranger to law enforcement.

       "       'The PlayStation 4 has dominated the current video game cycle over the past five years — and exclusive games like \"Marvel\\'s Spider-Man,\" \"Uncharted 4,\" and \"God of War\" are a big reason for that. \\r\\n The numbers highlight the importance of exclusives: Five of the top 10 best-selling PlayStation 4 games of all-time can\\'t be played on any other console, and 13 of the 28 PlayStation 4 games that made more than $1 million in sales — about half — are also PS4 exclusives. \\r\\n It\\'s not just sales. On Metacritic, which aggregates reviews from different publications, six of the top 10 best-reviewed PS4 games are exclusives, and roughly one-third of the PS4 games with a Metacritic score of at least 90 are exclusives as well. \\r\\n Not every exclusive PS4 title has been a mega-smash hit, and some releases feel directed towards different audiences. But there\\'s an underlying quality where each production, while extremely different in tone and style, has a consistent level of polish. \\r\\n \"We have to lead from the front,\" said Shawn Layden, chairman of SIE Worldwide Studios. \\r\\nKaren AURL \\r\\nLayden, 57, has been with Sony PlayStation for more than 30 years. He understands Sony\\'s global footprint better than anyone. \\r\\n The Notre Dame grad started working for Sony in Tokyo, not the US, in its corporate communications department under the the late Sony cofounder Akio Morita. He eventually moved to the UK to manage software development at the company\\'s London Studio, and shortly afterwards he became VP of Sony Computer Entertainment\\'s (SCE) Europe division. \\r\\n After nine years in Europe, Layden returned to Tokyo to serve as president of SCE Japan, and in 2010, he was named chief operating officer and executive vice president at Sony Network Entertainment International (SNEI). \\r\\n In 2014, Layden\\'s international work paid off back in the states: He was named president and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment America, succeeding veteran Jack Tretton and becoming the official face of PlayStation at all of the company\\'s big press events, including E3, the annual gaming expo in Los Angeles. Then last year, in a corporate reorganization, Layden was named chairman of Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) Worldwide Studios. \\r\\n Now, Layden is charged with managing the dozen-plus studios around the world that develop exclusive games for PlayStation consoles. Layden is routinely emailing, calling, and visiting these studios in person to talk with employees, check in on the status of upcoming games, and ensure the companies are reaching their goals, which Layden calls \"milestones\" or \"check-in points.\" \\r\\n Layden says managing the 13 game studios around the world under the SIE umbrella — seven in the United States, three in Europe, and two in Japan — is like managing different personalities. \\r\\n \"We are an entertainment business, which means the folks involved in creating the content are artists,\" Layden told Business Insider. \"I believe that to be true.\" \\r\\n On a recent phone call, Layden offered insight into his work schedule, how he copes with so much travel, and how Sony\\'s global approach, and focus on quality, has been key to the PlayStation 4\\'s success. \\r\\nThis interview has been lightly edited for clarity.\\r\\nDave Smith: How important is it for you to have studios all around the world, instead of just focusing on one region like the US? \\r\\nShawn Layden: We have a pretty broad tent with studios throughout the US, and Europe, and Asia. I think one of the interesting, unique features that we can claim from Worldwide Studios here at PlayStation is that we have the ability to create — and have shown the ability to create — triple-A content in three different regions. \\r\\nSony Interactive Entertainment America CEO Shawn Layden\\r\\n Christian PURL Images \\r\\nPlayStation was always intended to be a global platform. When we brought out the PlayStation back in 1994, we came out of Japan, but quickly moved to establish businesses in Europe and America. \\r\\n So together with that, the role of Worldwide Studios has been to not dominate the gaming market, not take the largest market share or dominant share of that, but to bring content to the platform, which really makes the hardware sing. \\r\\n To be truly a good platform, we have to be able to deliver, at that quality bar, content that appeals to our European fans, our Japanese fans, and our American fans. \\r\\nSmith: I\\'d love to know about how you control the quality and consistency across so many games that are exclusive to the console. SIE Worldwide must be a huge part of that. \\r\\nLayden: It\\'s our mandate. You know, we talk about this inside the studios: the rubric of \\'first,\\' \\'best\\' and \\'must;\\' The content we make has to fulfill one of those three rubrics. \\r\\n When we come out with a racing game, we\\'re gonna come out with the best racing game in the world — \"Gran Turismo.\" When we lean into action adventure, we\\'re gonna give you \"Uncharted,\" or \"God of War,\" or \"Horizon [Zero Dawn]\" — games like that. \\r\\n Since we only code to one platform, we really want to be the leader in showing everything that platform can deliver. We don\\'t have to make choices to create technologies which will run across many different target technologies. We just lean into the PlayStation thing solely. And it allows us to focus our attentions there. \\r\\n\"Horizon Zero Dawn\"\\r\\n Guerrilla Games \\r\\nThe working week \\r\\nSmith: What is a typical day like for you? \\r\\nLayden: I think my typical day, typically involves the airport. (laughs) Let\\'s just do this from the assumption that I\\'m in California, which is not a bad assumption, but it\\'s certainly not the majority [of my time]. \\r\\n Like most people, the first thing you do when you get up in the morning is you reach for your phone and, you know, see what has blown up somewhere. In the morning, I can talk to Europe. Quite often I\\'m touching base with a studio or leadership in our European studios. \\r\\n Throughout the day it\\'s, like so many business, really email driven. I spend a lot of time on the phone. And then in the evening, that\\'s the time when I can get in touch with our Japanese studios, and Japanese leadership. So it goes from early in the morning to late in the evening kind of cycle. I don\\'t think that\\'s any different from anybody else in this business. \\r\\nKaren AURL \\r\\nSmith: What are the biggest challenges you face at work on a day-to-day basis? \\r\\nLayden: I find the biggest challenge of my job is that we\\'re such a distributed entity, as far as Worldwide Studios go. \\r\\n We have studios scattered across the Pacific Northwest and California spine of the country. And our studios in Japan and Europe. \\r\\n So, what I really try to do is to get around the world as much as I can. Because everything you can get from a WebEx [teleconference], or an email, but at its heart, game production is a creative activity. And as a creative activity, it really comes down to the people behind the project. \\r\\n To really understand what their challenges are, or what their ambitions are and hopes are, you\\'re going to have to get there in person and, and speak to them about it. \\r\\nSmith: It seems like you\\'re on the road a lot. How do you cope with so much travel? Any good tips? \\r\\nAmazon\\r\\nLayden: I was very, very late to the party. But one of the greatest things about traveling is I finally bought a Kindle. The Paperwhite. It\\'s awesome. I don\\'t know how they managed to get a battery that lasts four weeks, but it\\'s a great piece of technology, and it has helped my carry-on luggage slim down, from carrying hard books. \\r\\n I still carry a Vita from time to time, but my Vita is a dedicated \"Everybody\\'s Golf\" machine. That remains my favorite pick-up-and-play game. I think it\\'s just the nature of it, you know. You can play a hole, and pause, and come back to it later. It\\'s very dip in, dip out. \\r\\n But traveling is all about reducing your carry weight. And so Kindle was a great move for me. \\r\\n Why Sony is skipping E3 \\r\\nSmith: It sounds like you\\'re spending a lot of time with each studio. But when you talk to them, what are the sorts of things you discuss? \\r\\nLayden: Well, I have a powerful partner in managing the studios — you know, the man, the myth, the legend, Shuhei Yoshida, who is president of our Worldwide Studios. And with him in the president\\'s seat, and me in the chairman seat, that gives us really good management coverage and visibility on the studio activities. \\r\\n Shu is as much or even more peripatetic than I am; that guy\\'s on the road all the time. He also believes the only way to really understand the day-to-day of the game development process is to really be there, be in the studios, be with the teams, and speak with them. \\r\\n So Shu and I have very close contact on a weekly basis to discuss what\\'s up with him, what\\'s up with me, and where we\\'re going with the teams. And then we have regular cadence amongst the leadership of Worldwide Studios that fits on a monthly basis. And then we try to get them out in the world. \\r\\n I try to see every studio at least quarterly. But things like GDC, or D.I.C.E., or GamesCom, those kind of events, actually brings us all together in the same space, and we always take advantage of those opportunities to huddle up and talk about the future. \\r\\nAndrew House, president and group CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment\\r\\n Reuters \\r\\nSmith: Speaking of those opportunities, you guys are not doing E3 this year, for the first time. Is this the future of Sony, to hold your own events and invite your developers into the fold that way? How do you plan on keeping tabs on everyone without E3? \\r\\nLayden: I think if you look at the industry over time, with E3, we were an original founder of that event through our association with ESA, and the other industry partners, 25 years ago. But it was a much different world then. \\r\\n I remember going to the first E3, and the only guests we had there were from retail. You\\'d come across people who would say things like, \"Hi, I\\'m the Sears buyer, and I\\'m in charge of Barbie, Hot Wheels, VHS, and video games. Can you tell me about your industry?\" So it was a real education process, talking with a guy from Sears, and explain to him what PlayStation 1 was all about. \\r\\n Fast forward to today, and our buying partners are Best Buy, or Target, or GameStop. I mean, they are as up to speed, or in some areas, more up to speed on the entire industry than we are. They\\'re plugged in 24/7, all year long. So the idea of coming together on a day in June to learn about the industry, that role for a trade show has kind of evaporated. \\r\\n We took the decision not to attend E3 this year, because we wanna make sure that when we do come together at some point, bring all our fans in under the invitation that PlayStation has something marvelous to share with you, we wanna make sure that we do. And E3 this year just wasn\\'t the right time for us. \\r\\n The importance of deadlines \\r\\nSmith: I want to talk about management style for a bit. Do you feel like your approach with the studios is more hands on or hands off? How important are deadlines to you? \\r\\nLayden: You know, we\\'ve been at this for over 25 years now. And I think we are understanding better the power of unleashing the creative — and really being able to speak with individuals, or with teams, that have a vision for a game they wanna bring forward. \\r\\n Having done it so often over so many years, I think we\\'re just getting better at it. We\\'re more experienced at it. We understand what the real cost, time and money, for a great scope is, and prepare ourselves to deliver that. \\r\\n Deadlines are important, but they\\'re not an end unto themselves. Deadlines, or milestones, are ways that you measure your progress across a trajectory. They\\'re check-in points. Are we achieving this level of artistic quality? If the story works, what are the beats? Are the animations executed? And more often than not, if we feel that we need to spend a little more time in any one of those categories, we\\'ve made provisions, and we\\'re prepared to move a date if it\\'s in service of achieving a greater result. \\r\\n And I know in the game community, people are disappointed to find out that, \"Hey! What do you mean you\\'re moving it up 30 days, or 60 days, or 90 days?\" But once we\\'ve come to market, everyone says, \"Oh my God, I\\'m so glad you did.\" (laughs) Because we can only answer that disappointment by delivering an awesome result. \\r\\nSmith: Do you find that you manage each company a little differently? Do you find that each company has its own kind of personality? \\r\\nLayden: Oh, absolutely. I mean, we are an entertainment business, which means that the folks involved in creating the content are artists. I believe that to be true. And when you\\'re working with artists, and the creative process, sure, it\\'s different every place you go. \\r\\n\"MLB: The Show 18\"\\r\\n Sony Interactive Entertainment \\r\\nWe have a team in San Diego that makes the world\\'s best baseball game, and I would argue the world\\'s best sports game — \"MLB: The Show.\" But they have to deliver every year by opening day. If you think about it, that\\'s an incredible business cycle. \\r\\n Others in the gaming community deliver sports titles annually as well, so they\\'ll understand the challenge of that, but to deliver that consistently at a quality bar, which is amazing, and keep your fans happy. They effectively work a 10-month development cycle. \\r\\n Then you have other teams, like Media Molecule, who have spent the last four or five years working on the Dreams technology, which we\\'ve just looked at the data a few weeks ago, and people are blown away by the power of that platform — to put games creativity into the hands of fans. \\r\\n And every other studio is as different as those two examples I\\'ve just given. So yes: Studios develop very differently, but we\\'re all committed to one thing, which is we will bring the best experiences on the PlayStation platform, better than anybody else. We have to do that. We have to lead from the front. \\r\\n What Sony doesn\\'t do \\r\\nSmith: The PlayStation 4 has been a huge success, but do you find there\\'s anything over this past cycle that you think PlayStation whiffed on? Was there anything you thought you guys could have done better, or just didn\\'t do it at all — and want to do better on the next cycle? \\r\\nLayden: For all of the advances we\\'ve made, and the high bar we\\'ve focused on in storytelling. I mean, I dare anybody to experience something like \"The Last of Us\" and not feel emotional about it; and with \"God of War,\" that story of a father and son; and \"Horizon [Zero Dawn],\" and the power of Aloy, the protagonist. \\r\\n All of these things, I believe we\\'ve done quite well. I\\'m very happy with the \"Spider-Man\" game that went out last year. And looking forward, \"Days Gone\" is coming in a couple months. That\\'s not only compelling and gripping, but it will emotionally try you very hard. I think all those things we do really well. \\r\\n What we don\\'t do so much in is multiplayer. \\r\\nSmith: Do you mean local multiplayer, where two people can play in the same room next to each other, or online multiplayer games? \\r\\nLayden: Couch co-op — I mean that\\'s a whole category I think the industry needs to look back at. We have that with sports titles, and some racing titles, but not with much else. And I think that speaks to the power of the internet on the one hand, but otherwise we might wanna revisit that to get more family engagement in the gaming experience. \\r\\n But, no, I was referencing more with the things like \"GTA 5 Online,\" or you look at \"Call of Duty,\" or \"Fortnite,\" or any of those experiences. Worldwide Studios, like I say, we\\'ve been going really heavy into story-driven gaming. The power of the narrative. Big, spectacular experiences. But not a whole lot in the multiplayer side of things, I think. That\\'s an area where you will likely see us start to make more noise in the new term. \\r\\n\"Fortnite\"/Epic Games \\r\\nNo competition \\r\\nSmith: Before we go, I wanted to ask you about the competition. How do you feel about your direct competitors? Is there anything you like about the Nintendo Switch and Xbox One? \\r\\nLayden: I don\\'t know if you got a chance to see Geoff Keighley at the Game Awards last December, but it caused a bit of a ruckus when the industry saw [Nintendo of America president] Reggie [Fils-Aimé], [Xbox boss] Phil [Spencer] and myself standing on stage at the introduction of the event. \\r\\n You know, we all have our Twitter feeds, and we all see the traffic that goes through there, and it seemed to create a bit of commotion. And I was struck by that thinking. People act like it\\'s the first time the three of us have ever gotten together. \\r\\n We all serve on the board of the Entertainment Software Association, the ESA. You\\'ll see us all together at events where we celebrate movements of the gaming industry, and just last year we got to award Laila Shabir, the founder of Girls Make Games, for the wonderful things she\\'s doing, for bringing young women into the gaming sector and learning about how that works. \\r\\nYouTURL \\r\\nReggie and Phil and I, we all have a lot of time for those outreach activities. And we work pretty well together. So, you know, I\\'m hoping that we\\'ve changed the conversation from \"competing platforms\" or, you know, which console won the holiday, or which platform won E3, and just look at what we\\'re all bringing to the video game industry from our different perspectives. \\r\\n I think Nintendo\\'s doing wonderful things with Switch, and the platform. And it\\'s sort of blurring the lines between what\\'s at home gaming, what\\'s on-the-go gaming. \\r\\n But also I think Xbox has really raced with us on how we\\'re pushing the bar out on technology and quality. And what they\\'ve done recently with their introduction of an adaptive controller, to increase accessibility in gaming, is a wonderful innovation. I hope to see more across the industry in support of that. We\\'ve been working with accessibility issues quite heavily for quite some time, particularly with Naughty Dog Studios and what they\\'ve done with giving gamers a variety of settings changes you can put into their games, depending on what your particular abilities are. \\r\\n So I think as an industry, we all move forward. And, I for one, am gonna stop talking about using phrases like competitive platform, because I think we\\'re all supporting and leading an entertainment revolution of gaming. You know, all hands to the till. We\\'re all in this together.',\n",
       "       'Last October, shares in France’s Michelin plummeted after it warned of declining demand in western Europe and China. Market watchers will have braced for even worse to come. One could smell the rubber yesterday as they sharply reversed uphill 13 per cent after a more bullish trading update. Shares in rivals Pirelli and Continental also rose strongly.\\r\\nWhy the about-turn? Michelin had sought to ensure maximum transparency about its various markets late last year. The subsequent share price volatility will no doubt have worried some in the market and does not help give the impression of stability. Nevertheless investors should see Michelin offering protection on a precarious road. \\r\\nAs the global auto sector enters a cyclical downturn, Michelin does hold some defensive qualities. Car drivers and global logistics companies may not buy as many new vehicles. They still have to replace their tyres. \\r\\nBetter than expected volumes and profits in the second half of last year reflected surprisingly strong North American sales, which compensated for China’s weaknesses. Michelin also pushed through price increases to defend profit margins — and its premium brand strategy. Its cautious optimism about 2019 contrasted with a warning last week from US rival Goodyear stating that headwinds had persisted beyond the fourth quarter. \\r\\nCrucially, Michelin’s free cash flow, at almost €1.3bn last year, exceeded expectations, too, and is targeted to reach more than €1.45bn in 2019. That more than covers a dividend yielding nearly 4 per cent. Yes, auto companies are struggling. Yet, Michelin is less reliant on China and sales in volatile emerging markets currencies than its largest rivals, Continental and Bridgestone. Finances are strong enough that Michelin has not ruled out share buybacks this year. \\r\\nWhile “Car-maggedon” may not occur, the automotive slowdown will have ripple effects on the tyremakers. But among those, Michelin should absorb most of the shocks. \\r\\nLex publishes two popular newsletters for premium subscribers. Wednesday: Lex Letter From London, New York or San Francisco.

       "       \"For years, IBM has offered corporate customers its Watson data crunching technologybut only if they used it on IBM’s cloud computing service. Now, in an effort to expand Watson’s reach, IBM is also making it available on competing cloud services.\\r\\nIBM said Tuesday that it would allow businesses to use some of IBM’s Watson-related software with underlying data that is stored in rival cloud data centers like Microsoft’s Azure and Amazon Web Services. Customers will also be able to use Watson with data stored in their own data centers.\\r\\n“It is enabling a level of openness that hasnt been available to date,” said Rob Thomas, IBM general manager of data and AI.\\r\\nThe move marks a departure for IBM, which, until now, hasn’t seemed anything but open with its cloud computing service and Watson technologies. In 2016, for example, then-IBM CFO and current IBM senior vice president of global markets Martin Schroeter told analysts during an earnings call, “Watson runs on our cloud, and our technology will run on IBMs cloud.\\r\\nBut IBM is now shaking up its strategy in an effort to broaden Watson’s appeal. The change of heart comes as IBM’s public cloud languishes in third place, at best, in terms of market share behind AWS and Microsoft Azure.\\r\\nDan Kirsch, a research analyst at Hurwitz & Associates, called IBM’s new service “really significant” because businesses are increasingly seeking technology that’s not dependent on a single vendor.\\r\\n“You look out of touch with your customers if you say you can only have our software and our capabilities if you adopt everything only from us,” Kirsch said.\\r\\nNick Patience, a founder and research vice president for 451 Research, said the move is “an acknowledgment by IBM that its a hybrid cloud world,” referring to firms wanting to use more than one cloud computing vendor as well as keeping some software running in their internal data centers.\\r\\nCloud computing companies like Amazon and Microsoft are pushing artificial intelligence because using technologies like deep learning typically require processing huge amounts of data through their cloud services, Patience explained. IBM deciding to make Watson available on competing cloud services could be a sign that “IBM is acknowledging that AWS, Microsoft, and Google are leading the pack in machine learning,” he said.\\r\\nKirsch explained that being more open could help IBM win customers that are concerned about being locked into one company’s cloud service for AI projects. In this way, they’ll be relatively free to pick and chose.\\r\\nIBM’s new service, Cloud Private for Data (ICP for Data), is built on the popular open source IT software Kubernetes, which was developed by Google as a way to manage data center infrastructure. The free software has become popular with developers because they can use the technology to build complex apps that are powered by multiple databases and services that theoretically don’t have to be tethered to a single cloud provider.\\r\\nWith the new technology, IBM customers can use Watson to do things like build machine-learning models and create digital chatbots.\\r\\nThomas said IBM hasn’t set a price for the new service and it will likely be tiered based on the customers’ needs. Additionally, while the service is currently compatible with only North American cloud providers like AWS, Asian cloud vendors like China tech giant Alibaba could be added in the future, Thomas said.\\r\\nGet Data Sheet, Fortunes technology newsletter.\\r\\nStill, Thomas argues that the best way to run Watson is through IBM’s own cloud computing service. Customers using it can choose from multiple hardware and computer chip configurations that squeeze the most power out of Watson.\\r\\n“We are confident in the IBM cloud that if clients try our products anywhere, they will eventually be drawn to IBM cloud and the uniqueness it provides,” said Thomas.\\r\\nAlthough companies are concerned about being locked into a specific company’s cloud infrastructure when it comes to certain software and IT products, Patience said they are currently in the early stages of using AI and are still willing to upload their corporate data to cloud services like AWS and rely on them for machine learning software. Being locked into a particular vendor when it comes to machine learning projects isn’t yet much of a concern, but IBM is betting that will change.\\r\\n“We dont hear a load of companies banging on the door saying, ‘This is outrageous, we demand more portability,'” Patience said.\\r\\nHe continued: “You could say IBM is trying to take back the initiative in machine learning here. The Watson brand has lost a little bit of luster over the years as others has come along. They are trying to take it back.”\",\n",

According to a press release, once their package is ready for pickup, customers will receive an e-mail along with a barcode. Amazon only allows items purchased on Amazon to be shipped to its lockers, so festival goers won\\'t be able to send themselves a care package or ship personal items from home. \\r\\n The custom storefront will include items from camping essentials to fashion and wellness products. \\r\\n \"We want customers to make the most out of their weekend at Coachella,\" said Patrick Supanc, Amazon\\'s Worldwide Director of Lockers and Pickup, in a statement. \"Bringing the convenience of Amazon Lockers to Coachella will help customers focus on their experience instead of worrying about forgetting something at home or having to carry it in with them.\" \\r\\nA look inside an Amazon Locker located inside a Century 21 department store.\\r\\n Business IURL Tyler \\r\\nAmazon first launched its Amazon Lockers in New York City, Seattle, and London back in 2011, and has since expanded their footprint in recent years to Whole Foods, 7-Eleven, Century 21, and other retailers in the US and abroad. \\r\\n Whether or not Amazon Lockers will be available for the festivals in the years going forward is unknown.

       "       'An asset class that had been unloved suddenly became all the rage towards the end of last year. \\r\\n Almost in unison, strategists urged investors to beef up their holdings of cash and its equivalents like Treasury bills. \\r\\n There were two main reasons. First, the stock market\\'s volatility and the outlook for even more gyrations this year raised the importance of having a safety hedge. Second, short-term interest rates had risen high enough to be an attractive alternative to riskier assets — so much so that cash was the best-performing asset class of 2018. \\r\\n It turns out investors heeded the advice, which had poured in from all corners of the sell side. According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch\\'s fund manager survey for February, the rotation into cash lifted traders\\' overweight position to its highest level since the Great Recession in January 2009. Their net cash allocation specifically jumped six percentage points to 44%. \\r\\n The BAML survey included fund managers who oversee a combined $515 billion in assets. \\r\\nBank of America Merrill Lynch \\r\\nThis rotation to cash happened at the expense of stocks. In February, fund managers reported the smallest overweight in equities since September 2016. \\r\\n What makes this rotation more striking, besides the post-crisis milestone, is that investors beefed up on cash even as stocks surged in January. \\r\\n At first blush, it\\'s a sign that investors are becoming more averse to taking risk in the stock market and would rather hold on to dry powder. \\r\\n However, Bank of America interprets the survey results differently. Michael Hartnett, the chief investment strategist, said in a note to clients that bearish investor positioning remains a positive for asset prices in the first quarter. \\r\\n His conclusion is derived from the fund manager survey\\'s \"cash rule.\" It triggers a contrarian buy signal when the average cash balance rise above 4.5%, and a contrarian sell signal when the balance falls below 3.5%. \\r\\n After all, more cash means that investors have more dry powder to deploy when they spot an attractive opportunity in the stock market. And as the chart above shows, huge cash piles are always put to work eventually.',\n",
       "       'Expecting big losses to follow a winning streak is an example of the gambler’s fallacy. But Plus500 investors had reason to suspect their luck would run out. The Israeli online trading company was one of the best FTSE 350 performers in 2018 with an 82 per cent return. On Tuesday, the shares fell by almost 30 per cent after it warned that this year’s profits would disappoint. \\r\\nThe company pinned the blame on a move by European regulators to protect amateur traders from racking up heavy losses on derivatives. The August crackdown limited the amount customers could borrow to juice up their bets. The effects were evident in a near halving of the number of new customers in 2018 and a near doubling of the cost of acquiring them. Only 2 per cent of the customers who were active in 2018 have so far been categorised as professionals, allowing them to escape leverage restraints.\\r\\nHowever, the fallout from tough regulations was predictable. London-listed rivals CMC Markets and IG Group have acknowledged the crackdown’s toll. Plus500 founders have offloaded stock: one sold £31m of shares in December. Short-sellers have piled in, hinting at further pain. With a tenth of shares out on loan, Plus500 is the fifth most-shorted UK stock. \\r\\nBut bulls caught out by Tuesday’s news should feel aggrieved. Management predicted in November and December that 2018 profits would beat expectations. Reassurances about the group’s performance since the August regulatory changes were issued just seven weeks ago. True, that was borne out by Tuesday’s figures showing a 90 per cent rise in net profit for the year. But the explanation was less reassuring. The surge in revenues in the fourth quarter was entirely down to customers’ bad bets, coming amid wild market moves. \\r\\nThat flattering of profits looks unsustainable. More worrying is the implications for the stability of the business. Plus500 has always said it made its money from spreads, the difference between the price at which customers can buy and sell, plus any overnight interest charges. The statistics bear that out: profits from its customers’ losses were just 3 per cent of revenues over five years. But behind that figure is a lot of volatility. In 2018 there was a gain of $172m; in 2017 a loss of $103m. That suggests a weaker quality of earnings than thought.\\r\\nFor Plus500, past events do influence the future. The shares remain a gamble to avoid. \\r\\nIf you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button ‘Add to myFT’, which appears at the top of this page above the headline',\n",
       "       'The savage murder last year of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, dismembered by Saudi Arabia’s agents in its consulate in Istanbul, surprised in the way it accelerated into the worst crisis between the kingdom and the west since September 11 2001, when 15 of the 19 hijackers who attacked the US turned out to be Saudis. It seems just as surprising that, as 2019 progresses, there is little let-up in the pressure on the Saudi leadership — in particular on Mohammed bin Salman, the powerful crown prince widely blamed for ordering the assassination. If anything, it is intensifying.\\r\\nIt surprises too when Adel al-Jubeir, Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs, is forced to go on US weekend TV shows to deny any Saudi part in the leaks of intimate texts and photos of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon owner, to the National Enquirer, the sensationalist US tabloid aligned with President Donald Trump. Why, after all, would Mr Bezos hint at a Saudi angle in this lurid story?\\r\\nThe Amazon multibillionaire is, of course, the owner of The Washington Post, in whose columns Khashoggi, an estranged court insider and former supporter of the crown prince, was writing trenchant critiques of the price Saudis were paying for Prince Mohammed’s tyrannical ways. The Post is relentlessly pursuing the Khashoggi case, insisting that the crown prince and his close circle were directly responsible for the murder — as the Turkish authorities, US intelligence agencies and some European governments have also concluded.\\r\\nYet it was The New York Times that last week ran a story saying American spy agencies in 2017 intercepted a phone call in which Prince Mohammed told a top aide he would use “a bullet” on Khashoggi unless he ceased his incessant criticism. That call was before the Post published its first regular Khashoggi column — but after the Saudi court had banned him from writing or tweeting.\\r\\nAt the time the young prince, handed unprecedented power by his father, the aged King Salman, was busily clearing his path to the throne in a Shakespearean series of palace coups. For a long while all this was dismissed as a sort of cost of doing political business in the Middle East.\\r\\nPrince Mohammed was the first third-generation prince to get his hands on the keys to the kingdom since its foundation in 1932 by King Abdulaziz ibn Saud, the grandfather he consciously tries to emulate. He had dazzled — with his ambition to change Saudi Arabia and the shower of riches chosen banks and backers could scoop up by helping him.\\r\\nWhile Saudi Arabia has never been less than an absolute monarchy, for the first time since Ibn Saud it now had an absolute monarch taking command. Apologists for his authoritarianism ran the gamut of clichés and nostrums, from “we live in a tough neighbourhood” to Alexis de Tocqueville’s “the most dangerous moment for a bad regime is when it begins to reform”. Almost everyone agrees that reform is a non-starter unless it brings to heel the powerful Wahhabi religious establishment, which has legitimised the House of Saud in return for the imposition of stifling puritanism at home and the export of radical bigotry abroad. No one wants to see Saudi Arabia dissolve — especially given the turmoil in the Arab world, from Syria to Libya to Yemen. It is not just the world’s largest oil exporter. It is the birthplace of Islam and its leaders are custodians of the Muslim holy sites of Mecca and Medina.\\r\\nBut sentiment changed after the Khashoggi murder. Prince Mohammed now seems to be one of the few forces on earth who can forge bipartisan consensus in the US Congress. This magic touch now extends to Brexit Britain, where he has united parties in the riven UK parliament on the question of the Saudi leadership’s treatment of women human rights activists. These include Loujain al-Hathloul, a campaigner for women’s right to drive. This is probably the most celebrated of the crown prince’s reforms — but no one except him can be allowed to claim the credit. The perception that Prince Mohammed was leading a sort of top-down Arab Spring has given way to alarm that he is presiding over a meltdown of Arab tyranny.\\r\\nIt is former cheerleaders for the Saudis, such as Lindsey Graham, the prominent US Republican senator, or Crispin Blunt, the Conservative MP who led the UK parliament’s foreign affairs committee, who have turned against the prince. Something has changed. Prince Mohammed is seen as dangerous.\\r\\nDoes this matter? He has the support of Mr Trump, even though the US president initially accused Riyadh of “the worst cover-up ever”. He has always had the support of his doting father, even if King Salman has on occasion sharply recast his son’s signature policies.\\r\\nThe US president is transactional: he expects returns for his support. His son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, sold him Prince Mohammed, not least as a game-changing backer of his “deal of the century” to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict. But there is little chance the prince can endorse a deal the US is heavily weighting towards the Israelis — not least because the king, upon whom he now depends more than ever, has explicitly and publicly repudiated this. \\r\\nMr Trump sets great store by Saudi promises to buy arms and invest in the US to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars. But this prince signs more memorandums than cheques. One cannot rule out that this most mercurial of presidents, in dealing with this most wilful of princes, may decide he has been sold fool’s gold.\\r\\ndavid.gardner@ft.com',\n",

The flight is usually about 11 hours long. \\r\\n The Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner was located just off New Caledonia island in the South Pacific when it turned back to Auckland Airport. \\r\\nOpenStreetMap/INSIDER. Information from FlightRadar24. \\r\\nThe reasons for the U-turn remain unclear. While Air New Zealand said it was because the aircraft used on Saturday was \"not yet certified to operate to China,\" New Zealand news site Stuff reported that it was because the airline had angered Beijing by listing the self-governing island of Taiwan as part of China. \\r\\n A spokesman for the airline told The Guardian: \"This issue relates to a particular aircraft which is not yet certified to operate to China but was unfortunately assigned to operate our Shanghai flight on Saturday night. \\r\\n \"Yesterday Air New Zealand was advised that the original application to have this aircraft registered to operate to China had expired and a fresh application was submitted,\" they added. \\r\\nA general view of the Shanghai skyline at night\\r\\nJamie McDURL\\r\\nCiting unnamed sources, on Tuesday Stuff reported that the paperwork in question had made a reference to Taiwan, which China saw as an acknowledgement of Taiwan\\'s status as an individual country.

Now he\\'s in charge of Google\\'s overall cloud business, including the Google Cloud Platform public cloud and the G Suite productivity apps for business.\\r\\nAt the conference, Kurian highlighted several products and pointed to several Google cloud customers using those products, including BNP Paribas, the city of Los Angeles, Home Depot, KeyBank and Telegraph Media Group.\\r\\nNow the company will focus more on individual industries like financial services and work more with channel partners, Kurian said.

       "       'Craig Fuller, CEO of FreightWaves, is used to people telling him that trucking is an obscure industry — even though it moves 71% of the country\\'s goods. \\r\\n His response to that is to point out how trucking compares to, say, the energy industry. Trucking transportation services are a $726 billion market, while petroleum refining total $501 billion in the US. \\r\\n And trucking is about to catch up to energy in one significant way. On March 29, the country\\'s first trucking freight futures market will sound its opening bell. That means the tens of thousands of firms who use trucks to move their goods will be able to better forecast what transport costs will total as far as 16 months ahead; transportation costs represent some 8% of US GDP. \\r\\n \"People always think about energy prices as creating inflation in the market,\" Fuller told Business Insider. \"Trucking and transportation is actually a bigger cost.\" \\r\\n The freight futures market will be in Chattanooga, Tennessee. It\\'s in partnership with FreightWaves, DAT, and Nodal Exchange. \\r\\nRead more:A 4-year-old trucking startup achieved a major victory in fixing one of transportation\\'s biggest inefficiencies — and it\\'s a huge win for truck drivers\\r\\n Trucking is a massive industry that touches many parts of consumers\\' lives. According to Fuller, there are more than 4,500 trucking companies that bring in more than $20 million in revenue annually. \\r\\n And there are 20,000 shippers who spend more than $10 million on trucking costs every year. Everyone ranging from Kellogg\\'s to Amazon to ExxonMobil needs to forecast their transportation costs. \\r\\n Not only is trucking huge, it\\'s also incredibly volatile. Rates last year jumped so much that major companies had to jack up the prices of their goods just to keep up. According to FreightWaves, 40% of Fortune 500 companies reported in late 2017 and in 2018 that transportation costs were harming their bottom lines. \\r\\n Fuller described 2018 as the trucking industry\\'s \"OPEC moment\" — when an entire industry realized just how volatile conditions, pricing, capacity, and labor issues can get. A futures market might be able to help transportation companies, and everyone who depends on trucking to move goods, ensure prices will remain stable. \\r\\n \"Once you add visibility and transparency to it with a futures contract, what will happen is that the delta between the high number and the low number will actually come down,\" Fuller said. \"What you end up doing is you mitigate your volatility.\"',\n",

       "       'Prices are fluctuating at Whole Foods. \\r\\n The organic grocer has raised prices on some items while discontinuing others, according to a leaked email reported by the Wall Street Journal. \\r\\n A Whole Foods spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider that the higher prices were due to rising material, packaging, and transportation costs. \\r\\n The increase is due to some item-specific contracts expiring. Of about 700 items with expiring contracts, the grocer says it has decided to stop selling about half and raise prices on less than 50. \\r\\n \"Like all grocers, Whole Foods Market has experienced increased costs from suppliers due to materials, labor and transportation, and we\\'ve absorbed much of the inflation,\" a Whole Foods spokeswoman said in a statement. \"Many prices have also decreased, and we continue to expand the number of promotions we offer to give our customers better value.\" \\r\\nRead more: Amazon\\'s earnings included a negative number, but the company said it doesn\\'t matter\\r\\n Of new contracts, more than 100 items are also seeing net price reductions, the spokesperson said. The items are chosen for renewal or promotion based on customer buying habits. \\r\\n These new price changes come after the highly publicized price reductions Amazon made when it purchased Whole Foods in 2017. The price cuts were made to ease the grocer\\'s \"Whole Paycheck\" image — in other words, that it\\'s too expensive for the average consumer. \\r\\n Whole Foods says it isn\\'t pulling away from that initiative. \\r\\n \"We remain committed to continuing to lower prices with Amazon as we deliver on our mission to make high-quality, natural and organic food more affordable and accessible,\" a Whole Foods spokeswoman said in a statement. \\r\\n Rising food prices are not a retailer-specific problem. Higher transportation costs fueled by a truck driver shortage have been steadily affecting the price of consumer goods for years now. That forces retailers to either absorb the increased costs or pass them on the consumer.',\n",
       "       'The potential loss of the Amazon headquarters would be more akin to a long-term disaster. During the 20th century, the city lost its two main economic underpinnings: its manufacturing base and its role as the busiest seaport on earth. In 1955, for example, about a million people worked in New York Citys factories, and in its crowded harbor, tramp steamers, ocean liners and tugboats struggled to avoid one another. New York was the leading industrial city in the world.\\r\\nAnd yet, by 1980, a quarter-century later, the major job centers in the five boroughs had essentially collapsed. In 1900, New York had 90 breweries and was the beer capital of the nation. But by 1976, the last brewery in the city was gone, and Milwaukee and St. Louis were competing for beer supremacy. Similarly, in 1950, New Yorks 300,000 textile workers made most of the womens clothes sold in the United States. The city had no serious rival. But by 2017, only about 20,000 such workers remained. \\r\\nNew Yorks job losses were not only blue-collar. During the 1970s, the city experienced an exodus of Fortune 500 corporations. Dozens of them moved their headquarters and took their executives with them. Some went to suburbs in Connecticut and New Jersey, but many more decamped for Atlanta, Dallas or Houston. The impact on the city was dramatic. Not only did workers laid off from those companies lose their jobs, but their spouses and children suffered as well. Many of them, as demographic statistics reveal, had to move to other states to make a living. Their departure was hidden by the fact that they were often replaced by millions of newcomers from other countries, but those immigrants could not immediately compensate for all those lost jobs.\\r\\nThe region now faces a calamity almost as bad as anything that has happened in the past. The loss of Amazon would cost 25,000 jobs directly, and those workers would support up to 82,000 more indirect jobs. The subsidies New York has offered to Amazon would have been given to any company promising so many jobs. And Amazon is expected to pay more than $27 billion in taxes over the next 25 years. Amazon will also build four million square feet of office space in Queens, providing billions more in construction spending. \\r\\nMore important, a new Amazon headquarters on the East River would signal that the future of this metropolis is as great as its past.',\n",

Theyve been looking for loans, and the interest in Mexico is 39 percent. I cant describe how happy it makes me to be able to do this for them.\\r\\nFor Cisneros, the nature of her success has always been steeped in generosity.\\r\\n\"I believe that there is a law in the universe that all the work we do is in service to those we love and it\\'s always going to bring us better rewards and fortune. It puts us in a state of grace when you are in service to your community,\" she said.\\r\\nCisneros, born in Chicago in 1954 to Mexican immigrants, is a writer-activist who came of age in 1970s-era of Black Power and the Chicano civil rights movement. She says she writes out of a sense of urgency because the world we live in is a house on fire and the people we love are burning. Writing for her is not just a political act but also a spiritual one.\\r\\nHer 1984 novel \"The House on Mango Street catapulted Cisneros to national acclaim. The book, which she has described as a necklace of stories of working-class Mexican-American girls, has sold over 6 million copies, been translated into 20 languages, and is required reading in many high schools and universities.\\r\\nThe idea of writing a best-seller was not on my mind when I wrote \\'The House on Mango Street,\\' she said. I wrote it to stop the swelling in my heart from the stories that I was hearing and witnessing.\\r\\nCisneros made her literary debut in 1980 with \"Bad Boys,\" a book of poems published by Lorna Dee Cervantes and Gary Soto as part of their Chicano Chapbook Series. The book is now considered a collectors item, selling for thousands of dollars.\\r\\nI used to sell that book for a dollar a copy out my backpack while I was still studying for my MFA, she recalls. I never thought Id make money writing.\\r\\nShe says she doesnt own a copy of the book, which is basically pages stapled together, but her brother does. He has it locked up with a key in a safe somewhere. It will probably help pay for my nephew\\'s tuition, she laughs.\\r\\nWhile she now makes a living with her pen, it was not always so easy for her or her LURL contemporaries.\\r\\nAuthor Sandra Cisneros is presented with the National Medal of Arts during an East Room ceremony at the White House on Sept. 22, 2016.Alex Wong / Getty Images file\\r\\nLatino writers were not being published by the mainstream press, so we had to publish ourselves, she says of the 1980s. I feel it\\'s our responsibility to support young Latino and Latina writers who are probably being discouraged by their families not to write and who are not being published by the big presses. Also, not all the good writers get attention and win awards so I feel I need to give back.\"\\r\\nThe New York Times Book Review has said that Cisneros is \"not only a gifted writer but an absolutely essential one.\" Her books include a 1987 collection of poetry, \"My Wicked Wicked Ways\"; a 1991 short-story collection, Woman Hollering Creek and other stories; followed by Loose Woman: Poems; and in 2002, the novel, Caramelo.\\r\\nIn 2015 she published a memoir, A House of My Own: Stories from My Life, which she said she completed after moving to her family\\'s ancestral Mexico after living in San Antonio for 30 years.\\r\\nCisneros also writes childrens books and authored an illustrated book for adults, Have You Seen Marie? which is currently being produced for the stage.\\r\\n\\'I\\'m just barely getting started\\'\\r\\nPast PEN winners include Phillip Roth, Mario Vargas Llosa and Edna OBrien. In naming Cisneros as this years winner, the judges the authors Alexander Chee, Edwidge Danticat and Valeria Luiselli wrote that Cisneros brings us astounding and lyrical voices from burning, maligned, devastated, as well as reassembled houses, and nations.\"\\r\\n\"Its hard to imagine navigating our world today without her stories and her voice guiding us toward much needed reclamation and endurance,\" they wrote.\\r\\nCisneros admits she was surprised by the award because \"it feels premature.\\r\\nAt 64, I am just barely getting started, and I say that in all sincerity, Cisneros said. If its about a lifetime award, I feel like I am not done with my lifes work. Ive had such great teachers,\" whom she calls her \"literary ancestors.\"\\r\\n\"I am never going to fill their chancletas,\" or sandals, she said. \"I have a long way to go.\\r\\nIt reminded her of a quote by the Japanese printmaker Hokusai one of her muses who said at 77 that if he could have five more years, only then could he call himself an artist.\\r\\nMoving to Mexico after living in Texas for three decades continues to transform her art and inform her inner life. She describes her time in Mexico as being in a state of joy where she is constantly daydreaming. Life in the quaint town surrounded by mountains is quiet, with little to no distractions.\\r\\nI am less afraid to say that I listen to the spirits who talk to me. I am exploring my spirituality because every piece of art is a spiritual act,\" she said.\\r\\nCisneros is also dipping into other forms of artistic expression. Her latest work, \"Puro Amor,\" is a small book of her illustrations.\\r\\nI am exploring and going in directions that I wanted to go all my life. I am not where I want to be,\" she said. \"I have seen what I would like to do, and I have a long way to go.\"\\r\\nCisneros is collaborating with the composer Derek Bermel for an opera based on \"The House on Mango Street.\" \"Mango Suite\" is set to premiere at Princeton in May.\\r\\nShe is working with the Santa Fe-based textile designer Nancy Traugott on a series of texts and textiles called \"Trapitos\" (rags) and is collaborating with Jose Rubén de León who is adapting Have You Seen Marie?\" for the theater. Cisneros is thrilled to be making her acting debut by playing the character of the river when the production previews this summer in Texas.\\r\\nLast year Cisneros received a Ford Foundation Art of Change fellowship and recently completed more than 50 oral histories of undocumented people, a chorus of voices that she hopes will be adapted for the stage. She is presently working on an essay about the Academy Award-nominated film \"Roma,\" told from the gaze of domestic workers.\\r\\n\"It\\'s not that I am consciously doing this art it\\'s organic and I am just learning,\" she said. \"This is the path I am on.\"\\r\\nCisneros will receive the PEN award on Feb. 26 in New York.

       "       'Since 1929, the Academy Awards ceremony has been the biggest night in Hollywood. But do you really care anymore? \\r\\n It feels like the Oscars are at a dire crossroads, from the telecast\\'s sagging ratings to its lack of diversity — which was pushed front-and-center by #OscarsSoWhite in 2015 — to this year\\'s hosting drama, and the stripping of categories from the live broadcast. \\r\\n But some within Hollywood believe their big night has been on life support for some time. \\r\\n Business Insider spoke to past Oscar show producers, Academy voters, and award show pundits to learn about the numerous attempts over the last two decades to make the Oscars telecast more modern. Despite these attempts, the show always seems to revert back to its more traditional form, and many in the industry think that\\'s a terrible trend. \\r\\n \"The show needs to change,\" Bill Mechanic, an Oscar-nominated producer who resigned from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\\' board of governors last year, told Business Insider. \"But not in a way that it\\'s watered down in terms of its artistic measurement, in fact, that should be preserved.\" \\r\\n Here we investigate what has gone wrong with the Academy Awards and what needs to be fixed. \\r\\n Where new ideas go to die \\r\\n The last time the Oscars didn\\'t have a host was in 1989, and that year will forever be known for having the worst opening in the show\\'s history: an 11 minute-plus musical number that followed Snow White as she navigated through different eras of Hollywood and all its glamour. It ended with her doing a duet with — wait for it — Rob Lowe. \\r\\n The backlash was immediate, including Disney suing the Academy for using the likeness of Snow White, and changed the course of the Oscar show forever. A review committee was formed to audit the show from top to bottom, leading to former DGA president Gil Cates producing the show the following year. He brought on Billy Crystal to host, which led to the Oscars\\' golden years. Gates, who died in 2011, produced the show a record 14 times, including the 70th Academy Awards in 1998 when \"Titanic\" won best picture, and the show was seen by over 57 million viewers, the most watched in history. \\r\\nRob Lowe and actress Eileen Bowman as Snow White performing a song during the opening of the 61st Academy Awards in 1989, marking the last time there has been no Oscar host.\\r\\n AP \\r\\nEverything surrounding the 2019 Oscars makes it feel like the show is facing another moment when change is needed. But it can\\'t seem to get out of its own way. \\r\\n Following the record-low ratings of last year\\'s show, the Academy\\'s attempt to rebound has been crippled by bad publicity. \\r\\n When word hit in August that a popular movie category at the Oscars was being considered, the outrage came from both the public and the industry. Then in early December Kevin Hart walked away from hosting this year\\'s show following an uproar over his past homophobic remarks, leaving the evening without a host. That was followed by a short-lived attempt to control the show\\'s run time by cutting out some of the performances from the best song nominees, and a new plan, announced Monday, to give out some technical awards during commercial breaks. \\r\\n The relegation of some awards to commercial breaks has angered many in Hollywood. \\r\\n \"To be at the show and your award not to be worthy, I think it\\'s somewhat insulting,\" Lili Fini Zanuck, who produced the 72nd Oscars in 2000 with her husband Richard D. Zanuck (the two produced best picture winner \"Driving Miss Daisy\"), told Business Insider regarding the decision to not televise live all 24 award categories. \\r\\n This kind of erratic maneuvering by the Academy is exactly the reason Bill Mechanic resigned from its board of governors last year. \\r\\n In a strongly worded farewell letter that Variety got its hands on, Mechanic — a former Fox executive, producer of the 82nd Oscars in 2010, and producer of best-picture nominee \"Hacksaw Ridge\" — said they had \"failed to move the Oscars into the modern age.\" He said the show was \"long and boring\" and that over the past decade, the Academy had \"nominated so many smaller independent films that the Oscars feel like they should be handed out in a tent.\" \\r\\nKevin Hart was named host of the 91st Academy Awards, but backed out followed backlash from homophobic tweets and stand-up material.\\r\\n Kevin WURL \\r\\n\"All my criticisms of when I quit the board are still valid,\" Mechanic told Business Insider recently. \"The simplest thing about the Academy, which is what got me riled up, is you have the best artists working, period, and that the membership is not being used to the degree that it should be is, to me, wrong ... Every idea should be considered.\" \\r\\n And ideas to make the ceremony more appealing to watch are brought up every year, they usually just don\\'t stick. \\r\\n Several former Oscar show producers told Business Insider that suggestions for something like a popular Oscar category, or limiting the number of awards presented during the live telecast, aren\\'t new. They have been kicked around within the Academy for over a decade. But the fact that those ideas are now at the point of serious consideration shows the severity of the situation the telecast is in. \\r\\n Zanuck recalled the effort to make the show look modern in the year she and her husband were at the controls in 2000. \\r\\n \"I felt that it was a television show and the live audience was somewhat irrelevant, because they were there mostly as nominees,\" she said. \"What I wanted to do was make it a broadcast. And to do that you had to look at these other shows that were working at the time, like the MTV Movie Awards and Video Awards. They weren\\'t only interesting but had a speed and a pacing to them.\" \\r\\nGarth Brooks performing in front of a giant screens at the 72nd Academy Awards in 2000.\\r\\n AP \\r\\nSo the Zanucks ditched the old Hollywood sets of previous Oscars and dressed the stage with 35-foot columns consisting of HD monitors stacked atop each other. Throughout the night, the screens would show clips from previous Oscar shows as the presenters took the stage. And instead of a live orchestra playing music through the show, the Zanucks had a pop music score. They also gave the viewers at home a deeper look inside the show by cutting to shots of what was going on backstage. \\r\\n It seemed to work. \\r\\n The show, hosted by Crystal, took in close to 47 million viewers, a bump from the 46 million that watched it the year before when \"Shakespeare in Love\" shocked the world and won best picture over \"Saving Private Ryan.\" In fact, it was the highest-rated show in this millennium. The Zanucks seemed to have updated the show in a way that still celebrated its history but was more engaging for viewers watching at home. \\r\\n But, outside of the brief shots of the backstage, many of the things done at the 72nd Oscars were not used again. \\r\\n \"They needed to continue to build on this idea I had that it\\'s a TV show,\" Zanuck said. \"After we did our year they went back to old sets, something from the 1920s, that was just taking you somewhere you had already been. The fact that it became old fashioned again didn\\'t help. There was no freshness to it.\" \\r\\n Mechanic said he had his own popular Oscar idea the year he and producer-director Adam Shankman (\"What Men Want\") did the Oscars in 2010. He wanted to have a selection of movies nominated for a viewers\\' choice Oscar. People at home would vote during the show. But he said it \"fell on deaf ears.\" \\r\\n \"A lot of people in the Academy don\\'t want to change anything and I think they are wrong not from a purist standpoint but from an entertainment standpoint,\" Mechanic said. \\r\\nYutong YURL Insider \\r\\nNo host is the best thing that could have happened\\r\\n Since the Academy is so resistant to change, the Oscars not having a host might be great for this year\\'s telecast, since it forces everyone involved to get out of their comfort zone. \\r\\n \"If you book presenters properly and they are big enough stars, you don\\'t need a host,\" said Jeff Margolis, who directed the Oscars telecast eight times, many of them in the show\\'s glory days alongside Cates. \\r\\n And Margolis knows a little something about doing the show without a host. The first ever Oscars he directed was in 1989, the last time the show didn\\'t have one. Though that show was infamous because of the Snow White opening, Margolis believes what Allan Carr, that year\\'s producer, did right was booking interesting presenters. \\r\\n \"Allan called it, \\'couples, companions, and compadres,\\'\" Margolis said about how they put together the presenters. \"And it really worked.\" \\r\\n The show featured presenters ranging from hot \"it\" couples of the time (Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith) to legendary duos from the movies (\"Vertigo\" stars Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak). \\r\\n Shankman, who produced the 82nd Oscars with Mechanic, pulled off the rare two-person-hosted show with Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin (the show was one of the highest-rated in the last decade). But his favorite moment didn\\'t involve the hosts. \\r\\n \"My year we had Robert Downey Jr. and Tina Fey present original screenplay, and I could have watched them all night, they weren\\'t the hosts,\" he said. \\r\\nTina Fey and Robert Downey Jr. with \"Zero Dark Thirty\" screenwriter Mark Boal (center) after presenting him with the best original screenplay Oscar at the 82nd Academy Awards in 2010.\\r\\n AP \\r\\nProducers who have done major live TV shows other than the Oscars agreed that the lack of a host isn\\'t a big deal. \\r\\n \"People don\\'t like a host doing shtick anymore,\" Ron Basile, a producer at AEG Ehrlich, the production company of veteran Grammys producer Kenneth Ehrlich, told Business Insider. \\r\\n And Ian Stewart — who has worked on everything from the 2012 Olympics opening ceremonies, to the Victoria\\'s Secret Fashion Show — believes in today\\'s world it\\'s less about finding the right host and more about crafting viral content that can spread on social media. \\r\\n \"I certainly have a check list on my productions of what are the 10 viral moments that we would hope to facilitate,\" he said. \"I think it\\'s up to us to create those viral moments.\" \\r\\n Is it time to disrupt the bloated award season? \\r\\n With some changes coming to this year\\'s Oscars, and some of the biggest blockbusters of the year nominated for best picture (\"Black Panther,\" \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" \"A Star Is Born\"), the telecast could be headed for a rebound year. \\r\\n But even if the 91st Oscars are produced in a way that keeps viewers engaged, there\\'s still the issue of the time of year the ceremony takes place, which many believe is hurting the show. \\r\\n Since the start of the Oscars almost a century ago, many other award shows have sprung up around it. \\r\\nRead more: The 21 biggest Oscar upsets of all time, ranked\\r\\n There are around 14 award ceremonies before the Oscars, from the ones televised (Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild, Critics Choice Awards, Independent Spirit Awards) to the many more that aren\\'t (Gotham Awards, National Society of Film Critics Awards, Producers Guild, Directors Guild, Screenwriters Guild). And because of social media and the horse-race coverage of the Oscars lead-up, many are burnt out by the time the big night arrives. \\r\\n \"I love movies, and I\\'m in the business, and I\\'m even tired of seeing Hollywood pat themselves on the back so many times,\" one Academy voter said. \\r\\n Many in the Academy believe the Oscars need to happen earlier. The theory: to bring viewer intrigue back to the show, it should no longer be the final act of award season. \\r\\n \"The cannibalization of the specialness of the evening is probably, in my opinion, been the single worst thing for the Oscars,\" Shankman said. \\r\\nYutong Yuan; Business IURL \\r\\nAnd this isn\\'t just a recent issue. Shankman recalled how obsessed everyone on the team was about every aspect of all the award shows leading up to their Oscars in 2010, so they wouldn\\'t repeat anything that happened previously in an award show. \\r\\n \"We had a giant board with all the shows that happened before the Oscars,\" he said. \"We were just staring at it and it looked like we were in a bookie\\'s office. It had flow charts, who was walking out and presenting what. We were tracking who was showing up at each awards show. I looked at Bill and was like, \\'How are we going to make this feel special?\\'\" \\r\\n In the dog-eat-dog world that is Hollywood, many feel the biggest dog needs to own the turf better. And it seems the Academy has finally caught on. In 2020, the Oscars will air on February 9, marking the earliest the show has ever been presented. But some think it should be in January. \\r\\n \"The problem with doing that is voters will not have had enough of a chance to see the movies, and it would essentially be declaring war on all these other shows,\" The Hollywood Reporter award columnist Scott Feinberg said. \\r\\nRead more: Here\\'s the complete list of the 2019 Oscar nominations\\r\\n \"They are going to make everybody else fit in a smaller window,\" Gold Derby managing editor Chris Beachum said. \"These non-televised events, they all rely on that evening being a big moneymaker for themselves — selling programs, advertisements, tables. They can\\'t afford to give up that night. So now you\\'re going to cause all of these award shows to fit into a much smaller window.\" \\r\\n Some aren\\'t as compassionate about this potential dilemma to award season. \\r\\n \"The Academy should push everybody out of business in terms of the awards,\" Mechanic said. \"There\\'s one award that matters and that\\'s the only thing to protect. There\\'s nothing else that matters.\" \\r\\n ABC has more control of the show than ever before \\r\\n When it comes to the Oscars, there\\'s no way to satisfy everyone. \\r\\n As Margolis put it, \"From the fade up from black to the fade out at the end, everybody is looking for something to hate during that show.\" \\r\\n But despite all the negative reviews posted the following day, and complaints that go viral, that show is still a huge moneymaker for ABC. \\r\\n The network, which in 2016 extended its contract to air the Oscars through 2028, has consistently raised the cost of the ad spots that run during the telecast. In 2017, it was $1.91 million per 30-second spot; last year, it was $2 million; and this year, $3 million. \\r\\n It\\'s a phenomenon that\\'s going on with all live \"must-see\" TV: ratings are sliding, but brands still believe it\\'s worth being there. \\r\\n \"If you\\'re a sponsor and you\\'re trying to reach any kind of mass appeal, you sort of grab at the platforms that can still do that,\" CNN media critic Brian Lowry said. \"The Oscars is in the same way that sports have an advantage, if you are really into the Oscars, you don\\'t want to DVR it and watch the next day. I wouldn\\'t be surprised to see Netflix, Amazon, or HBO ponying up for some ads during the Oscars because to launch your new spring shows it\\'s going to be one of the last big platforms to reach a lot of people.\" \\r\\nYutong YURL Insider \\r\\nBut ABC is now doing more than just selling ads. \\r\\n The network is through standing back and letting the Academy have full control of the show, which is how it had been for decades. One of the stipulations in the 2016 contract extension was that ABC now has more say in key creative aspects of the show. The choice of host and producer is now a discussion between ABC and the Academy (though the Academy has final say). This is why in the last two years you\\'ve seen a lot more ABC/Disney elements on the show, like Jimmy Kimmel hosting and using Disney titles in his stunts. \\r\\n Sources told Business Insider that for years ABC has wanted the show to only be three hours long, so coming off a year that had the worst ratings ever, it\\'s safe to say the network has more leverage than ever when it comes to run time. \\r\\nRead more: The 15 Oscar best-picture winners that made the most money at the US box office\\r\\n \"There is going to come a time when ABC expects the Academy to continue to deliver the product that they thought they were buying,\" Feinberg said. \"So far since that contract was extended I don\\'t think they can be all that pleased by what they\\'ve got.\" \\r\\nThe Oscars\\' high water mark. James Cameron celebrating his best director win for \"Titanic\" at the 70th Academy Awards in 1998, which were seen by over 57 million people.\\r\\n AP \\r\\n\"This has to be said, nobody does this show to fail,\" Shankman said. \"Everybody goes in wanting desperately to do the best job that they can and to honor the evening and to honor the people that are involved. Even the years that have been lowest in the ratings, there have been wonderful parts of the show.\" \\r\\n But it is hard to balance all the forces at play: ratings, artistic integrity, tradition, freshness. Often what you end up with is a show that satisfies no one. \\r\\n \"The show has stopped being what it\\'s supposed to be, which is a way to acknowledge each other,\" Zanuck said. \"That\\'s why it started as a dinner. No one was worried about what someone in Oklahoma thought. When it sounds like you need some gimmick to get people to watch, it\\'s so desperate and I think in a lot of ways that desperate feeling is what\\'s going to take it all down. The show has to get its integrity back. Winning an Oscar has got to mean something. If it keeps with these gasping for air moves, I don\\'t know where it can go.\" \\r\\n The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences did not respond to Business Insider\\'s numerous requests to comment for this story.',\n",
       "       'SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian environmental groups on Tuesday blasted President Jair Bolsonaro’s environment minister after he dismissed the murdered Amazon rain forest defender Chico Mendes as “irrelevant.” \\r\\n“I don’t know Chico Mendes,” Environment Minister Ricardo Salles told journalists on an interview show late Monday night, when asked about the famous Brazilian rubber tapper, union leader and environmentalist who was murdered in 1988. \\r\\nAs environment minister, Salles oversees the Instituto Chico Mendes, which is named after the environmental advocate and oversees Brazil’s protected conservation areas. \\r\\nBolsonaro downplayed environmental concerns during his 2018 far-right presidential campaign, threatening to pull Brazil out of the Paris Agreement on climate change and advocating more mining and economic development in the Amazon rainforest. \\r\\nSalles told interviewers on TV show Roda Viva that he hears contradictory accounts about Mendes’ life, saying environmentalists praise his work while local farmers claim he “used the rubber tappers to advance his own interests.” \\r\\n“It is irrelevant. What difference does it make who Chico Mendes is at the moment?” Salles said. \\r\\nHis comments fueled criticism of the administration’s stance, which environmentalists say is excessively pro-business and farm interests. \\r\\nMarina Silva, a former environment minister who organized alongside Mendes as a teenager in the state of Acre, said Salles is “misinformed” about the activist. \\r\\n“Despite the ignorance of Salles, Chico’s struggle lives on!” she wrote on Twitter. \\r\\nSalles also confirmed that he would travel to the Amazon for the first time on Tuesday. \\r\\nHis press office could not immediately clarify if it was his first visit as minister or his first-ever trip to the region. \\r\\nSalles also acknowledged that regulatory “shortcomings” may have led to the rupture of a dam for mining waste owned by Vale SA, which released a wave of mud killing at least 165 people and devastating the Paraobepa river. \\r\\nVale, the world’s largest iron ore miner, knew last year that the dam had a heightened risk of rupturing, according to an internal document seen by Reuters on Monday. \\r\\nIn 2015, a similar failure of a nearby tailings dam at a mine co-owned by Vale, also in the state of Minas Gerais, killed 19 people and damaged the Rio Doce river. \\r\\nThe minister said the government has been wasting technical and financial resources on licensing and oversight for all types of projects, and pledged to introduce policy changes to address the problem. \\r\\nHe defended a system whereby environmental licenses for less complex projects are issued faster, saying he believes this would free up resources to oversee projects of higher complexity, including tailings dams. \\r\\nReporting by Ana Mano; Editing by David Gregorio'],\n",

       "'SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian environmental groups on Tuesday blasted President Jair Bolsonaro’s environment minister after he dismissed the murdered Amazon rain forest defender Chico Mendes as “irrelevant.”  “I don’t know Chico Mendes,” Environment Minister Ricardo Salles told journalists on an interview show late Monday night, when asked about the famous Brazilian rubber tapper, union leader and environmentalist who was murdered in 1988.  As environment minister, Salles oversees the Instituto Chico Mendes, which is named after the environmental advocate and oversees Brazil’s protected conservation areas.  Bolsonaro downplayed environmental concerns during his 2018 far-right presidential campaign, threatening to pull Brazil out of the Paris Agreement on climate change and advocating more mining and economic development in the Amazon rainforest.  Salles told interviewers on TV show Roda Viva that he hears contradictory accounts about Mendes’ life, saying environmentalists praise his work while local farmers claim he “used the rubber tappers to advance his own interests.”  “It is irrelevant. What difference does it make who Chico Mendes is at the moment?” Salles said.  His comments fueled criticism of the administration’s stance, which environmentalists say is excessively pro-business and farm interests.  Marina Silva, a former environment minister who organized alongside Mendes as a teenager in the state of Acre, said Salles is “misinformed” about the activist.  “Despite the ignorance of Salles, Chico’s struggle lives on!” she wrote on Twitter.  Salles also confirmed that he would travel to the Amazon for the first time on Tuesday.  His press office could not immediately clarify if it was his first visit as minister or his first-ever trip to the region.  Salles also acknowledged that regulatory “shortcomings” may have led to the rupture of a dam for mining waste owned by Vale SA, which released a wave of mud killing at least 165 people and devastating the Paraobepa river.  Vale, the world’s largest iron ore miner, knew last year that the dam had a heightened risk of rupturing, according to an internal document seen by Reuters on Monday.  In 2015, a similar failure of a nearby tailings dam at a mine co-owned by Vale, also in the state of Minas Gerais, killed 19 people and damaged the Rio Doce river.  The minister said the government has been wasting technical and financial resources on licensing and oversight for all types of projects, and pledged to introduce policy changes to address the problem.  He defended a system whereby environmental licenses for less complex projects are issued faster, saying he believes this would free up resources to oversee projects of higher complexity, including tailings dams.
