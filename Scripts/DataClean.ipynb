       "'Amazon has shown that it is \"antithetical\" to New York values, and the company should not be allowed to build its second headquarters in Queens until it changes its ways, City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer told CNBC on Monday.\\r\\nBramer, deputy leader of the 51-member council, said one reason he is against the HQ2 deal is because of the online shopping behemoth\\'s stance on labor unions.\\r\\n\"They remarkably came to the City Council last week and declared not only would they not remain neutral when it came to efforts of their employees ... to organize but that they would actually fight to crush any effort of their employees to unionize,\" the Queens borough representative said on \"Squawk on the Street.\" \"This is a union town. I grew up in a union family. We\\'ve got to stand up for our values there.\"\\r\\nBramer, a Democrat, also called out Amazon\\'s reported ties to federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.\\r\\nSome Amazon shareholders have urged the tech giant to stop selling Rekognition, its facial recognition technology, to some government agencies. They have also said that Amazon is planning to pitch the service to ICE.\\r\\n\"Obviously we\\'re a sanctuary city. The mayor and all of us have declared that we want to be a safe haven for all immigrants, including the undocumented,\" Bramer said. \"Amazon refuses to budge on that issue.\"\\r\\nThe company has defended selling Rekognition to law enforcement.\\r\\nBramer believes Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, also Democrats, \"botched\" the deal, which includes roughly $3 billion in tax incentives, to lure the Seattle-based company\\'s investment. The plan is to bring part of its second headquarters and 25,000 jobs to the Long Island City neighborhood in Queens.\\r\\n\"All of those reasons and more lead us to fight this deal because at the end of the day, it\\'s a bad deal for New York,\" Bramer said.\\r\\nThe Washington Post reported on Friday that Amazon is reconsidering the New York development due to local opposition.\\r\\nIn response to the report, Cuomo said \"we have to make Amazon a reality\" in New York and that \"it is irresponsible to allow political opposition to overcome sound government policy.\" He equated such opposition to \"malpractice\" because the headquarters would create so many jobs in the city.\\r\\nDe Blasio\\'s office has defended tax incentives offered by the city for the project, saying it could generate $12.5 billion in future tax revenues.'"

       "'SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian environmental groups on Tuesday blasted President Jair Bolsonaro’s environment minister after he dismissed the murdered Amazon rain forest defender Chico Mendes as “irrelevant.”  “I don’t know Chico Mendes,” Environment Minister Ricardo Salles told journalists on an interview show late Monday night, when asked about the famous Brazilian rubber tapper, union leader and environmentalist who was murdered in 1988.  As environment minister, Salles oversees the Instituto Chico Mendes, which is named after the environmental advocate and oversees Brazil’s protected conservation areas.  Bolsonaro downplayed environmental concerns during his 2018 far-right presidential campaign, threatening to pull Brazil out of the Paris Agreement on climate change and advocating more mining and economic development in the Amazon rainforest.  Salles told interviewers on TV show Roda Viva that he hears contradictory accounts about Mendes’ life, saying environmentalists praise his work while local farmers claim he “used the rubber tappers to advance his own interests.”  “It is irrelevant. What difference does it make who Chico Mendes is at the moment?” Salles said.  His comments fueled criticism of the administration’s stance, which environmentalists say is excessively pro-business and farm interests.  Marina Silva, a former environment minister who organized alongside Mendes as a teenager in the state of Acre, said Salles is “misinformed” about the activist.  “Despite the ignorance of Salles, Chico’s struggle lives on!” she wrote on Twitter.  Salles also confirmed that he would travel to the Amazon for the first time on Tuesday.  His press office could not immediately clarify if it was his first visit as minister or his first-ever trip to the region.  Salles also acknowledged that regulatory “shortcomings” may have led to the rupture of a dam for mining waste owned by Vale SA, which released a wave of mud killing at least 165 people and devastating the Paraobepa river.  Vale, the world’s largest iron ore miner, knew last year that the dam had a heightened risk of rupturing, according to an internal document seen by Reuters on Monday.  In 2015, a similar failure of a nearby tailings dam at a mine co-owned by Vale, also in the state of Minas Gerais, killed 19 people and damaged the Rio Doce river.  The minister said the government has been wasting technical and financial resources on licensing and oversight for all types of projects, and pledged to introduce policy changes to address the problem.  He defended a system whereby environmental licenses for less complex projects are issued faster, saying he believes this would free up resources to oversee projects of higher complexity, including tailings dams.
