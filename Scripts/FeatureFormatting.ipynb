interview with Pierre Moscovici EU Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs and CNBCs Steve Sedgwick and Geoff Cutmore from the World Economic Forum 2018 SS Wouldnt it be nice if we could find someone whos in a senior position whos never done Davos before who can just say what he really thinks of it GC Yeah PD Yes SS Paschal Donohoe is that person PD Laughter SS Finance Minister of Ireland Your first Davos PD It is indeed SS Well congratulations PD Yes so having a very good a very positive week SS Well thats that was my question Are you cynical about Davos Or does it actually mean something PD No I think well what it offers governments and companies is the opportunity to meet many investors and colleagues very productively and very quickly SS Mm PD So for that alone I think its been a very very useful week I am struck by the tone that is here there is a tone that is generally upbeat theres a tone that believes that many of the political difficulties particularly of last year perhaps have allayed within Europe and that is reflated in to the tone that people have as they look forward to the future SS Mm For me Ireland sums up a lot of the thematic here Because you were called from the outside a poster boy of recovery You got your debt to GDD down aggressively you got your unemployment down aggressively as well Your NTMA is just cockahoop at actually getting you know 1 money rather than 14 tenyear yield at the peak of the crisis But but from the outside everything looked great but then the Taoiseach Mr Kenny lost an election pretty much or lost his majority because Ireland didnt feel it Because there were water taxes The Irish people just did not feel the recovery as well So you know your government and Mr Varadkars government as well has a different task doesnt it PD Yes I think thats a very very fair analysis of what actually happened within our own country and I think it is reflective of many of the challenges now that Europe faces in that there was a topline recovery in the numbers You know we could talk about what was happening with the deficit we could talk about what was happening with debt But of course we all know that a crisis can feed through with horrific speed to peoples daily lives but any kind of a recovery or change takes so much longer And what we are seeing happening now in Ireland is were gradually seeing an improvement in terms of the growth is now spread across our entire country across more parts of our economy But that being said we still have so much more we need to do We have to ensure that the changing economy makes a big difference to peoples lives we have to ensure that we have stable foundations for the future and then politicians of the center like myself have to really get the fact that a recovery in the economy isnt the same thing as a healed society and we have to understand the gap and rise to that challenge And you know Professor Stiglitz who I debated with yesterday on a number of different matters you know wrote a book called Globalization and its Discontents SS Ive read it myself PD And maybe you know the discontent bit we have to reflect a lot more on SS Mm Yes PD And see how we respond back to that which were trying to do SS The only problem for Joe is he wrote it 20 years before Piketty and I think hes a bit peeved that Piketty gets all the credit Laughter PD I I did say to him I said Are you more happy or less happy that many of your prophecies came true Laughter GC Can I just move you quickly on to Brexit and the benefits or otherwise for Ireland here Because the the Chancellor yesterday I thought made a pretty clear case that they are on their game as far as the financial services regulation is concerned and without a deal on that there is no broader deal with Brussels And I think Brussels is also starting to become aware of what the potential risks are But all of this means doesnt it that Ireland doesnt get that Brexit bump the windfall of bankers moving their jobs to Dublin PD Well weve already received and seen an increased investment and employment moving in to financial services in Ireland We have seen for example very significant addition GC Mm But not in the numbers you were hoping for PD We were always very clear that any benefit that would come from it would happen in a gradual way I think it was unrealistic and inaccurate to claim we were going to see banks closing down leaving the city of London weve seen companies like JP Morgan like Bank of America make very big and positive decisions about Dublin So we are seeing a a positive change as a result of that but this is all in the broader context that Brexit will be a challenge for Ireland You know weve made the decision to already change our growth forecast for the future so were now looking and aiming to deliver growth of approximately 3 across the coming years and weve downgraded that to take account of the fact of what we think Brexit could create so we can plan for a more sustainable policy base for our country for the coming years GC Mm SS I was just going to say on the Brexit how do you think its going I think from a British point of view and lets say Im politically agnostic on this one as well I think its going pretty badly as well I dont think weve resolved the border issue even though people say they have because I dont think the jurisdiction of the EU within Northern Ireland and hence whats going on across the Irish Sea has been successfully resolved PD We I believe and would contend very differently that the progress that was made in phase one of the negotiations in relation to an agreement about how to prevent the development of a hard border particularly in light of different contingencies and events SS Right PD Was a really important agreement We know and we expect the UK will honor it I believe theyre approaching this with very good faith in terms of how to do it SS Paschal I dont see how this works You either have EU rules that work across the border and again no one wants to see a return to the hard border we all remember the bad times as well PD Yes SS Or they stop at the Irish Sea or the British say Actually no we have no EU legislation or regulation within the United Kingdom I dont understand that thats been resolved PD Indeed and that kind of complexity will be at the heart of the negotiation as we move SS So it hasnt been agreed yet has it Paschal PD In to the phase two and the key principle that was recognized in that text was the principle of alignment of regulations if a number of different developments were to take place So what we have said is that when and if the EU and the UK reach an agreement in relation to the future of trade that could form a framework for dealing with many of the difficulties that youre right to raise But weve also said that if that doesnt happen the UK have recognized the role of alignment of standards with the Customs Union and the Single Market to ensure we can have the kind of movement on our island that is critical to ensuring a hard border does not return GC Just very briefly before we let you go we must bring up the issue of tax We saw the Taoiseach in the European Parliament pushing back a little bit at the criticism that youve received from the French and others for your current tax rate Given that Mr Macron came here and actually started talking a lot about cutting taxes in France do you think the mood music might actually be shifting here and god forbid there might even be room to reduce taxes even further in Ireland PD Well competitiveness is not just a prerogative of larger countries Small open economies are entitled to take choices to ensure were competitive and create jobs weve 2 million people that work in Ireland and corporate tax certainty is part of our competitive proposition but not all of it but its a very very important part GC Mm PD In terms of future changes in Irish corporate tax policy there will be no change in the rate Its 125 it will neither go up nor go down We have a flat stable rate which is low across a very large base of economic activity and we will continue to protect and maintain that while making the changes that we know we know need to be made GC This sounds like a preprepared statement if you dont mind me saying so Do you think Donald Trump has changed the conversation around tax in Europe PD Well it has the virtue of being a preprepared statement because I believe it and it is at the core of how we handle and create a positive international environment in Ireland with investors and employers To directly answer your second question do I believe the mood is changing regarding corporate tax globally The answer to that question is yes You have to look at what President Trump has done You have to look at the stated intentions of the UK You have to look at what President Macron said earlier on in the week But amidst that kind of change

interview with Pierre Moscovici EU Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs and CNBCs Steve Sedgwick and Geoff Cutmore from the World Economic Forum 2018 SS Wouldnt it be nice if we could find someone whos in a senior position whos never done Davos before who can just say what he really thinks of it GC Yeah PD Yes SS Paschal Donohoe is that person PD Laughter SS Finance Minister of Ireland Your first Davos PD It is indeed SS Well congratulations PD Yes so having a very good a very positive week SS Well thats that was my question Are you cynical about Davos Or does it actually mean something PD No I think well what it offers governments and companies is the opportunity to meet many investors and colleagues very productively and very quickly SS Mm PD So for that alone I think its been a very very useful week I am struck by the tone that is here there is a tone that is generally upbeat theres a tone that believes that many of the political difficulties particularly of last year perhaps have allayed within Europe and that is reflated in to the tone that people have as they look forward to the future SS Mm For me Ireland sums up a lot of the thematic here Because you were called from the outside a poster boy of recovery You got your debt to GDD down aggressively you got your unemployment down aggressively as well Your NTMA is just cockahoop at actually getting you know 1 money rather than 14 tenyear yield at the peak of the crisis But but from the outside everything looked great but then the Taoiseach Mr Kenny lost an election pretty much or lost his majority because Ireland didnt feel it Because there were water taxes The Irish people just did not feel the recovery as well So you know your government and Mr Varadkars government as well has a different task doesnt it PD Yes I think thats a very very fair analysis of what actually happened within our own country and I think it is reflective of many of the challenges now that Europe faces in that there was a topline recovery in the numbers You know we could talk about what was happening with the deficit we could talk about what was happening with debt But of course we all know that a crisis can feed through with horrific speed to peoples daily lives but any kind of a recovery or change takes so much longer And what we are seeing happening now in Ireland is were gradually seeing an improvement in terms of the growth is now spread across our entire country across more parts of our economy But that being said we still have so much more we need to do We have to ensure that the changing economy makes a big difference to peoples lives we have to ensure that we have stable foundations for the future and then politicians of the center like myself have to really get the fact that a recovery in the economy isnt the same thing as a healed society and we have to understand the gap and rise to that challenge And you know Professor Stiglitz who I debated with yesterday on a number of different matters you know wrote a book called Globalization and its Discontents SS Ive read it myself PD And maybe you know the discontent bit we have to reflect a lot more on SS Mm Yes PD And see how we respond back to that which were trying to do SS The only problem for Joe is he wrote it 20 years before Piketty and I think hes a bit peeved that Piketty gets all the credit Laughter PD I I did say to him I said Are you more happy or less happy that many of your prophecies came true Laughter GC Can I just move you quickly on to Brexit and the benefits or otherwise for Ireland here Because the the Chancellor yesterday I thought made a pretty clear case that they are on their game as far as the financial services regulation is concerned and without a deal on that there is no broader deal with Brussels And I think Brussels is also starting to become aware of what the potential risks are But all of this means doesnt it that Ireland doesnt get that Brexit bump the windfall of bankers moving their jobs to Dublin PD Well weve already received and seen an increased investment and employment moving in to financial services in Ireland We have seen for example very significant addition GC Mm But not in the numbers you were hoping for PD We were always very clear that any benefit that would come from it would happen in a gradual way I think it was unrealistic and inaccurate to claim we were going to see banks closing down leaving the city of London weve seen companies like JP Morgan like Bank of America make very big and positive decisions about Dublin So we are seeing a a positive change as a result of that but this is all in the broader context that Brexit will be a challenge for Ireland You know weve made the decision to already change our growth forecast for the future so were now looking and aiming to deliver growth of approximately 3 across the coming years and weve downgraded that to take account of the fact of what we think Brexit could create so we can plan for a more sustainable policy base for our country for the coming years GC Mm SS I was just going to say on the Brexit how do you think its going I think from a British point of view and lets say Im politically agnostic on this one as well I think its going pretty badly as well I dont think weve resolved the border issue even though people say they have because I dont think the jurisdiction of the EU within Northern Ireland and hence whats going on across the Irish Sea has been successfully resolved PD We I believe and would contend very differently that the progress that was made in phase one of the negotiations in relation to an agreement about how to prevent the development of a hard border particularly in light of different contingencies and events SS Right PD Was a really important agreement We know and we expect the UK will honor it I believe theyre approaching this with very good faith in terms of how to do it SS Paschal I dont see how this works You either have EU rules that work across the border and again no one wants to see a return to the hard border we all remember the bad times as well PD Yes SS Or they stop at the Irish Sea or the British say Actually no we have no EU legislation or regulation within the United Kingdom I dont understand that thats been resolved PD Indeed and that kind of complexity will be at the heart of the negotiation as we move SS So it hasnt been agreed yet has it Paschal PD In to the phase two and the key principle that was recognized in that text was the principle of alignment of regulations if a number of different developments were to take place So what we have said is that when and if the EU and the UK reach an agreement in relation to the future of trade that could form a framework for dealing with many of the difficulties that youre right to raise But weve also said that if that doesnt happen the UK have recognized the role of alignment of standards with the Customs Union and the Single Market to ensure we can have the kind of movement on our island that is critical to ensuring a hard border does not return GC Just very briefly before we let you go we must bring up the issue of tax We saw the Taoiseach in the European Parliament pushing back a little bit at the criticism that youve received from the French and others for your current tax rate Given that Mr Macron came here and actually started talking a lot about cutting taxes in France do you think the mood music might actually be shifting here and god forbid there might even be room to reduce taxes even further in Ireland PD Well competitiveness is not just a prerogative of larger countries Small open economies are entitled to take choices to ensure were competitive and create jobs weve 2 million people that work in Ireland and corporate tax certainty is part of our competitive proposition but not all of it but its a very very important part GC Mm PD In terms of future changes in Irish corporate tax policy there will be no change in the rate Its 125 it will neither go up nor go down We have a flat stable rate which is low across a very large base of economic activity and we will continue to protect and maintain that while making the changes that we know we know need to be made GC This sounds like a preprepared statement if you dont mind me saying so Do you think Donald Trump has changed the conversation around tax in Europe PD Well it has the virtue of being a preprepared statement because I believe it and it is at the core of how we handle and create a positive international environment in Ireland with investors and employers To directly answer your second question do I believe the mood is changing regarding corporate tax globally The answer to that question is yes You have to look at what President Trump has done You have to look at the stated intentions of the UK You have to look at what President Macron said earlier on in the week But amidst that kind of change what we are very clear on is that certainty regarding our rate is a core part of our proposition and we are now phasing out the DoubleIrish and we eliminated stateless companies from our tax code in 2013 and we have brought in mandatory disclosure of information regarding tax planning in our jurisdiction and were one of the first countries now to have exchange of information between the tax authorities across the European Union GC Paschal PD So well make those changes while maintaining the rate GC Minister thank you so much for being with us PD Thanks for having me on SS Paschal nice to meet you sir PD You too Thanks very much GC Paschal Donohoe the Finance Minister of Ireland and we look forward to to meeting up again next time PD I look forward to that too ENDS'] is not unicode"
