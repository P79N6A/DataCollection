growing of the big family offices who do these kinds of deals says Joseph Gleberman managing director for the Pritzker Organization I was in the private equity business at Goldman for a long time and its not dissimilar to what it was like 20 years ago when you started to see Blackstone do a deal with KKR or Goldman do a deal with Warburg Pincus Members of this group often insist on the terms family capital family investment firm or permanent capital investors rather than family office in an effort to avoid being associated with the more mundane details of family upkeep like arranging a billionaire familys travel schedule or even paying their taxes For Gottdenker the difference in management style is already apparent under Hargrays new ownership Were talking about our plans in ways that are different today he says Private equity is thinking of where were going to be in three to five years Now we can talk about what we want to look like in 2030 Hes not the only one who feels that way For Ben Livingston CEO of plastic container manufacturer Ring Container Technologies finding a longterm buyer was so important that the company included only a handful of family offices and long haul private equity funds in its sale process ruling out strategic buyers and most private equity Ring announced on Sept 14 that its chairman Carl Ring would sell his stake in the firm to MSD Partners which invests the assets of Michael Dell and his family Our interest was to find a buyer that would preserve our culture and essentially keep our leadership in place because I think thats a large part of our success says Livingston wholl keep an ownership share in the company We were focused on finding a buyer that would preserve those things Family capital can offer benefits a runofthemill private equity firm cant including experience operating a similar company or regional expansion And unlike private equity which is forced to exit investments after five to seven years as their funds expire capital from families doesnt come with a fixed expiration date This also allows them to spend money more freely on acquisitions There are softer selling features too Family capital can be more willing to offer existing owners a way to remain part of the business and can be more open to letting management continue to operate than a private equity firm might be Familyowned companies like the idea of a likeminded family owner because they like that notion of stewardship and continued legacy says Susan Elolampi head of the family coverage group for North America at JPMorgan Chase amp Cos investment bank They would like to have a longterm patient owner who might be less likely to move the business from its hometown fire workers or make decisions that may be good for a companys nearterm valuation but harmful for its longterm prospects Certainly part of their success has to do with the ability to stomach steep price tags TBG AG the investment arm of the Zurichbased ThyssenBornemisza family wasnt the only buyer interested in DTN a unit of Schneider Electric SE and a provider of weather fuel and agricultural data and analysis Strategic acquirers and private funds were also knocking on the door when Schneider put the unit up for sale according to Jerre Stead DTNs executive chairman and TBG board member TBG ultimately came out ahead acquiring the business this year for 900 million Stone Canyon Industries a firm backed by the wealth of former junk bond champion Michael Milken paid 24 billion when it bought packaging company BWAY Corp In April Stone Canyon persuaded the private equity owners of another packaging company Mauser Group NV to drop an initial public offering and enter into an acquisition through BWAY at a valuation of 23 billion Although it resembles a private equity firm on its face Stone Canyon appears more interested in building than the traditional private equity firm in the BWAYMauser tieup it paid top dollar to combine already massive packaging companies to strengthen their bases in the US and Europe Los Angelesbased Stone Canyon formed in 2014 by James Fordyce and Adam Cohn targets companies valued from 100 million to 2 billion that are the top one or two players in industries in which it invests according to a person with knowledge of its executives thinking Because these companies are so large already its easier for them to make strategic acquisitions relying on Stone Canyons dealmaking investment prowess and economies of scale Bankers advisers and family office employees whove been part of these sorts of deals provide conflicting estimates of how many family offices are capable of such acquisitions ranging from a halfdozen to several hundred Whats clear is that theyre getting better at working together to pool capital in a short time frame to go after deals and compete on price The amount of capital moving around has ballooned as well Family offices did 1006 billion in deals in 2016 compared with 251 billion in 2011 according to figures compiled by PitchBook Data Sensing the change private equity firms have begun offering new perks as part of a marketing pitch to large family offices that make direct investments Fiftyeight percent of private equity fund managers offered investors the opportunity to make coinvestmentsor to invest directly in a company alongside one of their fundsin 2016 up from 45 percent in 2014 according to data from Preqin And even the largest and bestknown of these private equity funds have gone to great lengths to draw family office clients in some cases allowing them to coinvest without already being a client Firms such as Carlyle Group Inc and Blackstone Group LP have also been crafting longerterm investment vehicles seeking to appeal to more permanent investors such as families endowments and sovereign wealth funds Families arent cutting private equity out of the action entirely That was the case when the partners of Blue Water Worldwide LLC a holding company capitalized by several families to buy and operate businesses hatched a plan to buy distressed stone quarries in 2009 Even working with the family of John Baker II former CEO of Florida Rock Industries Inc they knew they didnt have enough money to do it themselves And so the families turned to Lindsay Goldberg a now13 billion private equity firm that focuses on deals with familyowned businesses to put up the majority of the cash necessary to fund the entity and provide dealmaking expertise Called Bluegrass Materials Co the group started purchasing assets in late 2010 Building materials company Martin Marietta Materials Inc announced this June that it would acquire Bluegrass for 1625 billion We knew we needed access to a significant amount of capital says Benjamin Griswold a member of the eighth generation of the family that formed investment bank Alex Brown amp Sons in 1800 Griswold and his stepbrother William Whitridge founded Blue Water in 2007 Capital calls and scalability are a real advantage for private equity and an Achilles heel for families Griswold says Robert Blabey chief investment officer of family office advisory firm Align Private Capital who works with Blue Water consulting on investment and corporate strategy adds The benefit to working with private equity firms is its one partner and its one static capital pool so if they make a commitment the money is guaranteed Then again permanent capital is a strong allure If you can find likeminded families that have the same priorities he says and if the stars align then that can be a pretty powerful combination", "tags": "apple, banana, pear", "relevant articles": "3192, 11718, 2706"}, "related articles": [{"title": "Citigroup says this global bull market is far from over: 'Keep
