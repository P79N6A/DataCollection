newspapers The Bend Bulletin  Feb  12  on letting locals make zoning changes We ll agree with House Speaker Tina Kotek  D Portland  that Oregon has a housing crisis and solving it is going to take creative thinking That said  Kotek s belief that the Legislature is somehow better equipped to solve the problem than are local governments in Bend  Medford or La Grande is wrong  She ignores the role played by state land use planning laws that strangle city expansion and is the driving force behind a measure that does away with single family zoning in much of Oregon She s going after local governments with House Bill 2001  a measure that orders cities to do away with single family zoning  Communities with more than 10 000 residents would be required to allow duplexes  triplexes and or quadruplexes on all land currently zoned for single family housing But  as the House Committee on Human Services and Housing heard Monday from a member of the Sherwood City Council  the change could have unintended  and ugly  consequences  For one thing  it could make it more difficult for school districts to predict and accommodate growth within the limits of their bonding capacity Another unintended consequence could be a shift from neighborhoods that do not restrict property owners  rights with formal covenants  conditions and restrictions  to ones that do as people who can  seek out neighborhoods where multifamily housing is prohibited The worst problem with Kotek s bill  however  is the way in which it cuts local citizens and local government out decision making about their communities and the way they grow  In Bend  duplexes and triplexes are currently allowed in residential zones  and the city is working to add fourplexes to the mix But Bend s changes were made locally  not forced by Salem  They came about after local discussion and local public hearings  as state land use law now requires  Because they were a local creation  there s been considerable local buy in None of that will occur with Kotek s bill  Instead  it effectively prohibits locals from deciding what s best for their communities  It should be defeated Mail Tribune  Feb  12  on tone deaf harassment training being inexcusable The Oregon Legislature is off on the wrong foot in its attempt to address a toxic culture of sexual harassment  It s unclear who s at fault  although the federal government shutdown may have played a role  The important thing is to get newly instituted staff training sessions back on track  and quickly  before disillusioned staffers give up and refuse to attend Training last fall reportedly went well  but last week  staffers who attended a session conducted by a trainer from the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission walked out  saying the trainer appeared unaware of the culture of harassment that has become a major issue in the Capitol for more than a year The trainer reportedly joked about those who file harassment complaints  saying   as you all know  snitches get stitches  At another point  the trainer responded to the topic of inappropriate touching in a dismissive manner  saying  we all know this is bad  we don t need to talk about that It was inappropriate touching that ended the career of veteran State Sen  Jeff Kruse  R Roseburg  after two female lawmakers accused Kruse of inappropriate behavior two years ago  including groping them in meetings  Kruse denied the allegations  but resigned his seat Then  last year  the state Bureau of Labor and Industries declared the Legislature a hostile work environment after an investigation  Legislative leaders have appointed a Committee on Culture to address the issue But before that committee can make any headway  it must fix what appears to be a tone deaf approach by at least one trainer provided by the federal EEOC  According to one report  the trainer who conducted last fall s successful session was unavailable because of the federal shutdown  State officials requested a different trainer for this week s session  and representatives of the EEOC visited Salem to meet with legislative leaders on Friday Regardless of the reason for last week s disastrous training session  there can be no excuse for it  If the EEOC can t provide appropriate training  the state should look elsewhere Albany Democrat Herald  Feb  12  on colleges being wary of governor s budget plan When she released her proposed state budget for the two years beginning in July  Gov  Kate Brown didn t include any additional money for higher education but she did express a hope that legislators would be able to push through a  1 9 billion tax increase  and that some of the extra money could be funneled to help hold tuition increases to 5 percent or less It s possible that part of Brown s strategy on this was to persuade education officials to lobby legislators to support the tax increase  The governor has declined to offer specifics about what sort of tax increase she d like to see  and has left that task to the Legislature It s fair to say that some education officials have been  shall we say  cool to Brown s approach  For evidence  look no further than Oregon State University Ed Ray s state of the university speech  delivered last week in Portland Under the governor s budget  Ray told a crowd of 700 or so OSU partisans   universities would be forced to shunt even more costs onto the shoulders of students  and cut staffing and programs even more  Or both A little later in his remarks in Portland  Ray added this   I appreciate the governor for seeking new funding  but I must plan the university s operations on what I know  not what I hope legislators and voters might approve at some future date And certainly  considering how tax proposals have fared in the Legislature and among the state s voters  it doesn t seem like a good bet to count on that extra dough just yet  especially since it s not at all clear yet what shape a tax increase could take To that end  Ray told the newspaper s editorial board last week that work to identify potential cuts is underway at OSU   Linn Benton Community College has launched a similar process Although Brown s proposed budget is the first step  the process doesn t really get going until legislative committees release their first budget drafts  That will happen after state economists release their latest revenue estimates As an aside  it s worth noting again that legislators likely will have a record amount of revenue at their disposal  but it won t be enough to cover increased costs  Two big factors drive those costs  the state s public pension system and the decision to expand Oregon s Medicaid health insurance plan  also known as the Oregon Health Plan It seems unlikely that the Legislature s first budget drafts will follow Brown s lead in terms of higher education funding  But  beyond that  little about the final shape of state budget is clear yet and state colleges and universities don t have the luxury of waiting until the Legislature is wrapping up its work in June to start thinking about their budgets Public universities also need to get approval for any tuition increases above 5 percent from the state s Higher Education Coordinating Commission and Brown has intervened when she believes proposed increases are too high   Complicating the situation is that the governor has declined to back the estimated  220 million it would take to keep tuition increases under 5 percent  unless lawmakers approve the  2 billion in new revenue In the meantime  business groups are beginning to weigh in on the proposed tax increases  Sandra McDonough  president of the state s largest business association  Oregon Business  amp  Industry  told legislators last week that her group believes that a business activity tax would be fairer and less harmful to businesses than a gross receipts tax  which is based on sales We are committed to being part of the revenue discussion  McDonough said That s good to hear  But we heard the same thing two years ago  before these discussions went off the rails  In the meantime  higher education officials are charting out how they can make steep cutbacks in their operations and if you were in their shoes  you d be doing the same thing Copyright 2019 The Associated Press  All rights reserved  This material may not be published
