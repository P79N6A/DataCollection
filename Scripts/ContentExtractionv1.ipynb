       "['Target Corp. ’s price war with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is taking a toll. Target posted a disappointing outlook on Wednesday, in part because of investments made to lower prices, boost wages and develop new brands. That sent the shares down the most in five months. Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell is cutting prices, remodeling more than 1,000 locations and opening dozens of smaller stores in cities and on college campuses. It’s all part of a $7 billion multiyear plan to get the cheap-chic retailer back on more solid footing. Speed is of the essence, though, as rival Wal-Mart is pushing deeper into fashion: It just reached a deal to sell Lord &amp; Taylor merchandise on its website beginning next year. The results “reflect the impact of its short-term investments for long-term benefit,” Moody’s Corp. analyst Charlie O’Shea said. Profit margins are getting squeezed “as a result of Target’s tactical price investments, as well as the persistent market share battles with Amazon and Wal-Mart in multiple categories.” While the company boosted its forecast for full-year profit to $4.40 to $4.60 a share, the midpoint trailed analysts’ average projection of $4.53. Target shares fell as much as 9.9 percent to $54.13 in New York trading, their biggest slide since mid-June. They had already declined 17 percent this year through Tuesday. Wal-Mart will give an update on its progress Thursday when it reports third-quarter results. Gross margins will continue to be pressured this quarter because of the shift to lower prices as well as costs associated with fulfilling online orders, Chief Financial Officer Cathy Smith said on a call with investors. Target is now offering same-day delivery from four New York City stores, and its next-day “Restock” service for everyday household goods spans 11 markets. Even so, Target’s newest exclusive brands -- which include A New Day, Goodfellow &amp; Co. and JoyLab -- will be “very beneficial to short-term and long-term gross margin performance,” Cornell said on the call. That’s because the company’s private labels earn higher margins compared to national brands. New Brands The company’s painful transition showed signs of payoff last quarter. Its same-store sales increased 0.9 percent, topping the average prediction for a 0.4 percent gain, according to Consensus Metrix. It also posted 24 percent growth in online sales. Target has unveiled eight new apparel, home decor and kid-focused brands across its 1,800 stores in an effort to lure back shoppers who’ve strayed from the retailer in recent years. In September, only 29 percent of U.S. households shopped at Target, according to research firm Kantar Retail, down from 39 percent five years ago. The new product lines should generate $10 billion in sales, Target has said, and on Wednesday Cornell said they could deliver even more than that. The company has lowered prices on everything from coffee to paper towels, and in the third quarter “held its ground” against Wal-Mart in groceries, according to analyst Dan Binder of Jefferies. “Target’s introduction of new private label brands looks to be gaining traction, and traffic levels look solid,” said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. The new product lines could represent $10 billion in sales, Target has said, and would follow the success of kids’ apparel line Cat &amp; Jack, now a $2 billion brand.',\n",
       " \"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Target Corp. (TGT) on Wednesday reported fiscal third-quarter profit of $480 million. The Minneapolis-based company said it had profit of 88 cents per share. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, came to 91 cents per share. The results topped Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of 86 cents per share. The retailer posted revenue of $16.67 billion in the period, which also beat Street forecasts. Five analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $16.61 billion. For the current quarter ending in January, Target expects its per-share earnings to range from $1.05 to $1.25. Analysts surveyed by Zacks had forecast adjusted earnings per share of $1.27.

       " 'Target’s (tgt) return to growth is proving to be a bit expensive for many investors, and shares fell sharply on Wednesday on the retailer’s underwhelming holiday quarter profit forecast. The discount retailer reported good news on the sales front, with comparable sales rising 0.9% in the third quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of 0.4%, according to Consensus Metrix. And more crucially, as a leading indicator of consumer interest in the retailer heading into the peak of the holiday season, visits to stores (excluding newly opened or closed ones) rose 1.4%. That suggests that Target’s efforts at better integration between stores and e-commerce, better product presentation and customer service, and new house brands like Cat &amp; Jack are getting people to turn up at its physical stores. At the same time, online sales rose 24% during the quarter. Target CEO Brian Cornell in a statement said that holiday season shoppers could expect an improved shopper experience thanks to “our investments in wages, training and additional hours.” Target is adding 100,000 seasonal workers this year, making it one of the few major retailers to ramp up holiday season hiring. Cornell also suggested Target would offer price cuts to match those of competitors, as well as its own deals. The retailer has been trying to go to-toe-to with Walmart (wmt) and Amazon.com (amzn), which are already proving to be aggressive in this year’s Christmas period price war. But these investments cost money, and Target’s holiday quarter profit forecast came in well below what Wall Street was expecting, sending shares down 5% in premarket trading. The retailer expects adjusted earnings of $1.05 to $1.25 per share for the quarter ending January 2018, by far the most important of the year for Target, compared to the average analyst estimate of $1.24, according to Thomson Reuters. While Target has shaken off a year-long sales slump, it has been playing catch up on some fronts compared to Walmart, and those investments in e-commerce, store remodels, and store worker raises are taking a toll. Earlier this year, the company announced a $7 billion reinvention plan that, among other things, would remodel hundreds of stores and continue the roll-out of its successful small format urban stores, including a recently opened location in the heart of Manhattan’s biggest shopping district, a new tack for a retailer historically focused on suburbs. For the quarter ended Oct. 28, Target’s net income fell to $480 million, or 88 cents per share, from $608 million, or $1.06 per share, a year earlier. Total sales rose 1.4% to $16.67 billion.',\n",
       " 'For the past year, Amazon employees have been test driving Amazon Go, an experimental convenience store in downtown Seattle. The idea is to let consumers walk in, pick up items and then pay for them without ever standing in line at a cashier. Amazon is vague on the mechanics, but the store relies on a mobile app and some of the same sensing technology that powers self-driving cars to figure out who is buying what. Employees have tried to fool the technology. One day, three enterprising Amazonians donned bright yellow Pikachu costumes and cruised around grabbing sandwiches, drinks and snacks. The algorithms nailed it, according to a person familiar with the situation, correctly identifying the employees and charging their Amazon accounts, even though they were obscured behind yellow polyester. The Amazon Go grocery store in Seattle. Amazon Go represents Amazon.com Inc.’s most ambitious effort yet to transform the brick-and-mortar shopping experience by eliminating the checkout line, saving customers time and furthering the company’s reputation for convenience. The push into groceries is a way for the company to get consumers to shop at Amazon more often. The e-commerce giant unveiled Amazon Go last December, saying it planned to open the store to the public early this year. However, the company encountered technical difficulties and postponed the launch to work out the bugs, The Wall Street Journal reported in March. Seven months later, challenges remain, but the “just walk out” technology has improved markedly, says the person, who requested anonymity to speak freely about the project. And in a sign that the concept is almost ready for prime time, hiring for the Amazon Go team has shifted from the engineers and research scientists needed to perfect the platform to the construction managers and marketers who would build and promote the stores to consumers. Amazon declined to comment. Shoppers visiting an Amazon Go store will scan their smartphones upon entering. Cameras and shelf sensors will then work together to figure out which items have been removed and who removed them, the person says; there will be no need for tracking devices, such as radio frequency chips, embedded in the merchandise. When shoppers leave, algorithms will total the order and bill their Amazon account. The system is working well for individual shoppers but still struggles to accurately charge people who are moving around in groups, such as families with grabby kids, the person says. Go engineers have been studying families shopping together and are tweaking their sensors to recognize when a child eats an item while wandering around the store. Engineers are also figuring out which person to charge when a couple goes shopping together. Amazon has encouraged employees to enter the store in pairs and buy lunch. The company is conducting further tests and focus groups from an undisclosed building in Seattle, the person said. The focus groups are used to design protocols for in-store returns, spoiled or damaged merchandise and customer service issues that are common to brick-and-mortar retail. It’s unclear how quickly Amazon Go will ramp up. The company has moved deliberately with its brick-and-mortar book stores, opening just 13 in seven states since launching the first one in Seattle two years ago. Analysts expect a version of Amazon Go technology to be rolled out eventually at Whole Foods Market, the upscale grocery chain Amazon acquired in September for $13.7 billion. That’s a far more challenging prospect because Whole Foods locations are much larger than the 1,800-square-foot convenience store and carry thousands more products. Amazon, which says it currently has no such plans, would need a lot more testers wearing Pikachu costumes to pull that off.',\n",
       " 'Amazon.com on Wednesday unveiled more discounts on several grocery products at Whole Foods Market, days ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, sending stocks of rival U.S. grocers lower in early trading. The lower prices include deeper discounts on some items for Amazon Prime members (amzn) and come on top of price cuts already announced by Whole Foods in August, when Amazon completed its $13.7 billion acquisition of the upscale grocer. Shares of rival U.S. grocers including Costco (cost), Sprouts Farmers Market (sfm), and Kroger (kr) all fell on Wednesday morning following the announcement. Investors have closely followed any signals of price cuts at Whole Foods for its effects on the U.S. grocery industry, which is already reeling under a brutal price war. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Amazon, which forayed into brick-and-mortar retailing with its purchase of Whole Foods, could upend the grocery industry and undercut traditional retailers by using its deep pockets and large presence, analysts have said. Whole Foods said it would sell organic turkey for $3.49 per pound to all customers, while Prime members could buy it at an even lower price of $2.99 a pound. It will also offer lower prices on items from national brands including Chobani Yogurt and Applegate Hot Dogs as well as smaller organic brands such as Eden Foods. “These are the latest new lower prices in our ongoing integration and innovation with Amazon, and we’re just getting started,” Whole Foods CEO John Mackey said in a statement. A study last month showed Whole Foods’ previous price cuts on items including bananas, avocados, and beef had drawn customers away from retailers such as Wal-Mart, Trader Joe’s, and Sprouts Farmers.',\n",
       " 'Physical stores are still a vital component to retailers\\' businesses, Target Chief Executive Brian Cornell told CNBC\\'s \"Squawk on the Street\" Wednesday morning. Over half of Target\\'s digital sales growth is enabled by its stores, Cornell explained. Target reported fiscal third-quarter earnings and same-store sales that outpaced Street expectations. But an underwhelming outlook for the fourth quarter, which includes holiday sales, sent Target\\'s stock tumbling Wednesday morning. \"While we expect the fourth-quarter environment to be highly competitive, we are very confident in our holiday season plans,\" Chief Executive Brian Cornell explained in prepared remarks. This is a developing story. Please check back for updates. —CNBC\\'s Courtney Reagan contributed to this reporting.',\n",
       " \"The so-called core CPI gained 0.1 percent in September. October's increase lifted the year-on-year increase in the core CPI to 1.8 percent. The year-on-year core CPI had increased by 1.7 percent for five straight months. The slight pickup in the monthly core CPI could offer some comfort to Federal Reserve officials amid concerns that stubbornly low inflation might reflect not only temporary factors but developments that could prove more persistent. The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, has consistently undershot the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target for more than five years. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates in December. It has lifted borrowing costs twice this year and has projected three rate increases in 2018. Last month, the cost of rental accommodation rose 0.3 percent, matching the increase in September. Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence climbed 0.3 percent after advancing 0.2 percent in September. The cost of hospital services increased 0.5 percent and prices for doctor visits rose 0.2 percent. There were also increases in prices for wireless phone services, airline fares, education and motor vehicle insurance. Prices for used cars and trucks rose 0.7 percent, ending nine straight months of declines. New motor vehicle prices, however, fell for a second consecutive month as manufacturers resorted to deep discounting to eliminate an inventory overhang.\",\n",
       " 'There was much to cheer in Target Corp.\\'s third-quarter earnings results. It delivered comparable sales growth for the second consecutive quarter, thanks to a healthy 1.4 percent increase in traffic compared to the same period last year. And yet investors sent the shares down, likely because they were more focused on other numbers in Thursday\\'s report : Namely, that net income fell 21 percent from a year earlier. And even as CEO Brian Cornell declared in a press release that his team is \"very confident\" in its holiday season plans, Target\\'s earnings forecast for the fourth quarter wasn\\'t as upbeat as investors had hoped. But if you take a long-term view of Target\\'s prospects, it\\'s hard to be overly concerned about this hit to profitability. And that\\'s because the big-box store is spending money on the right things. In part, Target\\'s profit was crimped in the quarter because it remodeled 37 stores, a step in an ongoing effort to revamp more than 1,000 locations by 2020. For a retailer that in the latest quarter drew 96 percent of its sales from brick-and-mortar stores, it\\'s hard to argue against spiffing up its fleet. Number of stores Target spent money to remodel in 3Q 37 Meanwhile, it also raised its minimum wage to $11 per hour in October. With a tighter labor market and competitors such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. having long ago bumped up their wage floors, this is a smart way to attract and retain workers. Still more profit pressure came from lowering prices on everyday essentials. There were signs this helped Target in key ways in the quarter. Executives said they saw a \"meaningful\" increase in sales at regular price in the quarter, along with an increase in customers making shorter, quicker, \"fill-in\" trips. That suggests the price cuts are helping get shoppers in the door. And finally, fulfillment costs for online orders also weighed on profitability. But that\\'s not such a bad thing, as it\\'s a byproduct of growing e-commerce sales. All of this is to say that the parallel universe in which Target does not take these profit-eating steps is much worse for the company. Would investors rather that customer service suffered at Target because it didn\\'t pay people competitively? Would they prefer that Target let its stores spiral into dumpiness? (Just look at how disastrously that has worked out for Sears Holdings Corp.) It is prudent to incur this short-term pain, especially when you consider the other things Target has going for it. Its investment in developing new private brands is paying off. Its Cat &amp; Jack kids-clothing line is a big success. And it has been encouraged by early sales of Goodfellow &amp; Co., its new menswear line, and Hearth and Hand with Magnolia, a home-goods line created in partnership with HGTV stars Chip and Joanna Gaines. Margins tend to be relatively high on private brands, so it\\'s promising that Target seems to be scoring with these launches. And executives said they saw double-digit increases in comparable sales in the adult beverage category from the same period last year. This is noteworthy because it\\'s one of the store areas where Target\\'s remodeling spending is most apparent. Wine, for example, is now presented in sleek-looking wooden crates that give the department a more upscale feel. This offers evidence the money it\\'s spending on making stores look better can help with top-line sales. Also, let\\'s take a moment to breathe a sigh of relief about what we didn\\'t hear from Target. In recent quarters, it has sometimes chalked up its challenges to a choppy consumer environment -- an explanation that felt a bit like an excuse when consumer sentiment has generally been strong. But that was not mentioned as a headwind on Thursday, suggesting the retailer sees more sustained strength across varied geographic markets. Overall, Target is looking like a better business today than it did six months ago -- even if investors aren\\'t giving them credit for it at this moment.

       " 'Almost half of all online shopping will be on Amazon.com this holiday season, cementing Jeff Bezos\\'s commercial grip over one of the most important seasons, according to one analyst. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey said Amazon\\'s ever-broadening product selection and the popular shift toward online shopping will lead to big profit for the e-commerce giant. In a note to clients, analyst Youssef Squali argued that the current Adobe projections for online sales are too low. \"Adobe is projecting online holiday shopping sales to hit $107.4 billion in the U.S.,\" wrote Squali in a note to clients. \"Given a record breaking Prime Day in 2Q, continued momentum in 3Q, and the fact that this is just the second holiday season offering monthly Prime memberships, we expect a record-breaking holiday season for the company.\" Amazon shares fell 0.8 percent in midday Wednesday after the report. Its shares are up 50 percent year to date through Tuesday versus the S&amp;P 500\\'s 15 percent gain. The analyst has a buy rating on Amazon as well as a price target of $1,270, which is 12 percent above its current price. Suntrust isn\\'t the only analyst bullish on Amazon. In similar fashion, Morgan Stanley outlined a case for the company to reach a $1 trillion valuation. Morgan Stanley reiterated its overweight call on Amazon shares, presenting a potential \"bull case\" with a 12-month price target of $2,000 per share, or roughly a $1 trillion market cap. \"Amazon\\'s high margin [revenue] disclosure speaks to the $1trln ($2,000/sh) sum of parts bull case,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a note to clients Sunday. While Amazon\\'s ascent to retail monarchy has been the product of years of logistical tailoring, SunTrust\\'s Squali argues that there are multiple reasons why Adobe\\'s Digital Insights numbers may be too low.',\n",
       " 'For Target, its turnaround plan isn\\'t yet hitting on all cylinders. Though the big-box retailer\\'s third-quarter earnings, revenue and same-store sales outpaced analysts\\' expectations on Wednesday, that news was clouded out as Target put out a very conservative forecast for the upcoming holiday season. Investors were quick to react, sending Target shares down more than 9 percent by mid-afternoon trade. All things considered, many signs point toward progress for the Minneapolis-based company. Target\\'s online sales grew 24 percent during the latest period, and the retailer saw an uptick in the number of customer transactions in stores compared with a year ago. But analysts are calling out Target\\'s slimmer gross margins, increased pricing pressure in certain categories, and competition from retail rivals Wal-Mart and Amazon. And like everything else, progress takes time. \"No retailer of Target\\'s scale and size can implement a quick turnaround in today\\'s retail market,\" GlobalData Retail Managing Director Neil Saunders wrote in a note to clients. \"The process of reinvention takes time, effort and money — all of which have to be expended before any eventual rewards are reaped,\" added Saunders. \"In Target\\'s case, pressure on the bottom line has come from increased staffing costs, lower prices, and improvements to stores and products.\" Target\\'s strategy is vastly different than that of Wal-Mart, which has been on an acquisition run of late, buying up smaller retailers and partnering with outside brands including Hudson\\'s Bay Lord &amp; Taylor. Instead, Target is betting on its own strengths, one of those being its private-label business. Eight new brands in the apparel and home goods categories have already launched this year, including \"Joy Lab\" for athletic clothing and \"Project 62\" for furnishings. Target management has said private-label sales are set to be \"very beneficial both short-term and long-term for gross margin rate performance.\" But Saunders notably pointed out: \"It is taking time to persuade people who have never bought clothing at Target to look again at the offer.\" Investments are also pouring into refurbishing Target\\'s existing stores, opening up smaller locations in densely populated markets, and keeping prices appealing to shoppers and in-line with other retailers. \"For Target, we think these investments are intelligent and long overdue, but they will take time to resonate with its core shopper... leading to some lag between \\'investments\\' and \\'results,\\'\" said Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom. \"This will remain a headwind for most of 2018.\" Chief Executive Brian Cornell explained Wednesday how Target is also expanding its online order pickup service, same-day delivery options, curbside car loading and Target Restock, a program similar to Amazon\\'s Prime Pantry. Additionally, more than 1,400 Target locations today are able to fulfill online orders, compared with 140 stores just a few years ago. Physical stores are still a vital component to retailers\\' businesses, Cornell told CNBC\\'s \"Squawk on the Street\" Wednesday morning. Target ended the third quarter with more than 1,800 stores, in various sizes, nationwide. \"This quarter is another proof point along the journey,\" Chief Financial Officer Cathy Smith said on a call with members of the media. \"I would see it as we\\'re planning prudently,\" she added regarding the company\\'s fourth-quarter earnings outlook, which falls on the low end of Street estimates. Heading into the holidays, Target will try to find its footing in a crowded market. To begin, the retailer has hired 100,000 seasonal employees this year to create the optimal in-store experience for shoppers. And Target is betting on its beauty, home, toys and apparel categories to be top performers. \"We enter every holiday season knowing it will be highly competitive and promotional,\" Smith said on a call with analysts and investors. Target is calling for comparable sales to be flat or better in the fourth quarter, rising as much as 2 percent. \"The company is now in a much stronger position than it was at this time last year, which bodes well for the holiday quarter,\" said Saunders. Target will provide a post-holiday financial update on Jan. 9.',\n",
       " 'Amazon is preparing to launch Amazon Go, an ambitious and experimental retail concept that uses sensors and other technology, not cashiers, to identify and automatically charge customers. For the past year, Amazon employees have been testing, and trying to trick, the technology in its 1,800-square foot shop Amazon Go store in downtown Seattle. Now, the tech is apparently close to being ready for the public, Bloomberg reported. For example, employees dressed up in bright yellow Pikachu costumes to try and fool sensors and cameras that identify when someone is trying to buy products at an Amazon Go marketplace. Amazon’s tech wasn’t fooled. However, some kinks remain to be worked out such as accurately charging people in groups. In practice, Amazon Go customers would be able to walk into the store, grab the products they want, and walk out without waiting in line for a cashier. If the idea is a success it could help Amazon reach even more consumers and disrupt the traditional brick-and-mortar retail business—again. Amazon unveiled its plans for Amazon Go last December. The location offers prepared food, grocery staples like bread, cheese, and milk. Amazon is expected to sell its own meal kits too. What’s not clear is if branded items from Whole Foods, which Amazon acquired in August for $13.7 billion, will also be in the Amazon Go stores.',\n",
       " 'Amazon is ironing out the final kinks in its cashier-free convenience store platform, according to a Wednesday report from Bloomberg. The company\\'s latest brick-and-mortar experiment, called Amazon Go, excises the checkout line from the supermarket experience by scanning customers\\' smartphones upon entry and using mobile sensing technology to keep tabs on the items they remove from shelves. The technology, while not yet perfected, has been much improved at the flagship Amazon Go location in Seattle, a person familiar with the situation told Bloomberg. After in-store technology glitches forced the company to postpone the public-facing launch of Amazon Go, the \"just walk out\" technology has been refined to the point that the team has begun hiring marketing and promotional staff, Bloomberg reported. The tech giant says it has no plans to adapt Amazon Go to the comparably gigantic Whole Foods supermarkets, all of which were acquired by Amazon for $13.7 billion this year. Many analysts, however, anticipate Amazon ultimately will want to deploy the technology to its brick-and-mortar grocery stores, according to Bloomberg.

       " 'Big-box retailers Wal-Mart and Best Buy are due to report quarterly earnings on Thursday, and one strategist is watching specifically for the companies\\' holiday sales forecasts. After Target \"pre-warned\" about a relatively soft holiday season on Wednesday in its own earnings report, the guidance for other large retailers will matter for the broader retail space, said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management. Here\\'s why: • Shares of Target fell nearly 10 percent in Wednesday trading after it reported earnings, due in large part to what it believes could be a soft holiday season. If Wal-Mart and Best Buy reports reflect similarly dim forecasts, Schlossberg said, he would grow worried about what the fourth quarter holds. • \"Given the fact that so much of retail has now moved to online, it\\'s almost a slam dunk to think that Amazon is going to be the primary beneficiary of whatever Christmas demand we\\'re going to see this year. The big question is whether the brick-and-mortar stores are going to be able to stave off some of that customer demand and capture some of the additional dollars,\" he said Wednesday on CNBC\\'s \" Trading Nation.\" • Schlossberg added that as far as brick-and-mortar retailers go, Apple could pose a threat to other retailers\\' sales given the recent iPhone X launch and its hefty price tag. • \"If demand for the [iPhone] X really is strong into the Christmas season, it may very well simply cut out spending for all other items,\" he said. Analysts are expecting earnings per share of 78 cents for Best Buy and 97 cents for Wal-Mart, according to FactSet estimates. Bottom line: Should Wal-Mart and Best Buy report dim holiday season forecasts on Thursday, this could spell a warning for the retail space, Schlossberg said.',\n",
       " 'Amazon’s cashier-free stores can catch thieves even if they’re hiding in a Pokemon costume, according to a new report. In a recent attempt to fool sensors and cameras that identify when someone is trying to buy products at an Amazon Go marketplace, some of the company’s employees dressed in bright yellow Pikachu costumes, according to Bloomberg. As the people picked up sandwiches and drinks in feigned hope of not getting caught, Amazon was able to identify who they were and charge their Amazon accounts for their purchases, Bloomberg’s sources said. Amazon Go is an ambitious attempt by the company to build out a retail presence without actually relying upon cashiers. Instead, Amazon Go stores, which are currently in testing, would stock products for customers to buy and let them walk out once they pick up what they want without ever seeing a cashier. Sensors, cameras, and other technologies in the store will identify the customers and automatically charge their accounts for whatever they walk out of the store with. Get Data Sheet, Fortune ’s technology newsletter Amazon unveiled the store concept last December and had hoped to get some locations open in 2017. However, after some of the theft-defying technologies failed, Amazon was forced to work on fixes. A Bloomberg source said that Amazon’s efforts at thwarting thieves have been improving and the company is now looking for construction workers and marketers to help make its concept a reality. Bloomberg’s sources didn’t say exactly when the stores might open to the public, but testing is ongoing. For instance, Amazon is currently examining how to ensure its technology is sensitive enough to know when someone eats an item in a store. After all, if you eat it, you buy it.',\n",
       " 'Can a central bank steer the housing market? Not so long ago, Sweden’s Riksbank decided: no. Now, there’s a risk that decision may backfire as the biggest property market in Scandinavia risks sinking into a correction. The evidence of price declines was so worrying on Tuesday that it contributed to a 1.5 percent slump in the krona against the euro. A weak currency puts the Riksbank’s inflation target at risk. So should it be looking at the housing market more closely? Developments in Sweden’s housing market “could spark some doubts at the Riksbank as it may affect the overall economic outlook and inflation,” Nordea analyst Andreas Wallstrom said in a note. Read more on housing market here Sweden’s Riksbank has thrown all its energy into fighting deflation and, earlier this year, finally regained credibility on its inflation mandate. Policy makers now say they may be ready to start raising rates in the middle of next year. At the same time, the Riksbank may extend a bond purchase program due to end this year. But in the minutes of the Riksbank’s latest rate meeting, Deputy Governor Cecilia Skingsley suggested that monetary policy, “under certain circumstances, can be used to combat the effects of major household debt.” She also said the housing market “must be carefully monitored,” given the latest developments. Nordea’s Wallstrom says the central bank will probably need to see a “sharp drop” in house prices with a direct impact on the real economy before it will look into adding significant stimulus. But the bank might decided to signal rates will stay where they are for even longer. “A smaller step for the Riksbank is, however, to pull down the rate path further,” he said. “This could happen already in December.” Meanwhile, even the bank’s inflation targeting efforts are yielding mixed results. The latest data show that Swedish inflation was below the Riksbank’s target in October. Read more on inflation report here — With assistance by Niklas Magnusson',\n",

I‘ll use it in the future I don‘t think I‘ll use it Please tell us why (optional) The US healthcare industry has become gripped in recent months by the possibility that Amazon will start selling prescription drugs, creating a powerful new competitor in a sector worth $450bn a year. Amazon has not said anything about its intentions, leaving analysts and investors to engage in a kind of corporate Kremlinology, seizing on titbits of information to gauge whether the company is plotting a move. But the mere suggestion Amazon wants to enter the market is already proving consequential. Many analysts cite the competitive threat as the primary motivation for a mooted tie-up between CVS Health, one of the largest drugstore operators, and Aetna, the health insurer. Recent moves by pharmacy chains to offer next-day home delivery for medicines have also been linked to the possibility of Amazon entering the market. It is not just the size of the opportunity that might prove tempting for Amazon, but also the chance to lower prices and disrupt an opaque industry in which it is hard to know who to blame for the soaring cost of drugs. Just about everyone in the US agrees medicines are too expensive, but the industry is torn on who is responsible, whether it be pharmaceutical companies, wholesalers, or pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) who act as “middlemen” between drugmakers and their customers. “I think there’s plenty of opportunity for impactful efficiency measures to be put in place to control drug prices in this country,” says Michael Rea, chief executive of Rx Savings, which makes software to help employers and their workers cut the amount they spend on medicine. “A new entrant like Amazon would put pressure on the pharmacies and the PBMs to do more with less.” The Amazon speculation has made an already torrid year even worse for US drugstore chains, with investors wiping more than $40bn from the market value of the biggest operators — Walgreens Boots Alliance, CVS and Rite Aid — since the start of 2017. Their problems include the falling price of generic drugs, which has crimped the amount the companies make per prescription, and a woeful environment for bricks-and-mortar retailers as customers move online. “The drug retailers have a good deal to worry about, because if Amazon plays its cards right, it could offer generic drugs materially cheaper than the large players,” says Alex Schmelzer, chief executive of Mesa Rx, a pharmaceuticals cost savings consultancy. Although Amazon has kept quiet about its plans, it has become increasingly interested in healthcare in recent months, holding meetings with industry executives and making several senior hires from insurers and PBMs. The online retailer has cast a wide net in its search for talent; in the summer it hired Christine Henningsgaard, formerly chief operating officer of Hometeam, a New York start-up that offers in-home nursing and caregiving services for the elderly. Amazon confirmed the appointment of Ms Henningsgaard, who has worked in healthcare since at least 2007, but declined to elaborate on her role. Her LinkedIn profile says she works on “strategic initiatives”. The group has also invited several executives from companies operating in the pharmacy sector to its Seattle headquarters, according to two people who attended the meetings, in which participants talked about the challenges facing the industry and the high price of drugs. Many of the conversations concerned the company’s own health plan, which covers roughly 260,000 Amazon employees, and on the options for the 90,000 workers who joined the group following its acquisition of Whole Foods Market, the upscale grocery chain. But one person who attended the meetings said Amazon executives see the company’s health plan — which ranks among the largest in the US — as a “testing ground” that would prove useful if the company entered the pharmacy sector. Amazon declined to comment on the private meetings. The company has already started selling professional medical equipment, and a person briefed on its strategy said it was this part of the business that recently applied for wholesale pharmacy licences in several states. Analysts and investors had initially interpreted the award of those licences as a firm sign the company was planning to sell drugs online, but Amazon said: “Wholesale licenses are required... to sell professional-use only products to healthcare customers, from medical and dental offices to hospitals.” In the absence of hard facts, analysts and executives have speculated as to what an Amazon push into prescription drugs might look like. Ana Gupte, analyst at Leerink, anticipates that Amazon will take on wholesalers at first, using its significant warehouse capacity and logistics experience to undercut traditional players such as McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health. “The conventional wisdom is that wholesale margins are thin, but Amazon operates on even thinner margins,” she says. Recommended Ms Gupte thinks Amazon will then quickly turn to selling drugs to consumers, using its heft to increase the low proportion of prescriptions that are delivered through the mail, which stands at roughly 10 per cent: “If Amazon makes the experience as transparent and friendly as it is for their other goods and services, then I think they will increase that penetration from a low base,” she says. The company could also dispense medicines through retail pharmacies in its more than 450 Whole Foods stores, says Ms Gupte. However, she believes Amazon will stop short of setting up its own PBM because of the significant medical expertise needed for such an endeavour. PBMs have a huge influence on the drugs that patients end up taking in the US because they control the “formularies”: the master lists of drugs that employers and the government will pay for. By giving preferential treatment to some medicines over rival alternatives on the formularies, while excluding other drugs entirely, the PBMs play a powerful if indirect role in the doctor-patient patient relationship. “I don’t think Amazon is going to get into the clinical stuff,” says Ms Gupte. Ian Read, chief executive of Pfizer, the largest standalone drugmaker in the US, appeared to agree when he discussed the possibility of Amazon entering the market on a call with investors last month. “Any system of distribution that can cut costs and get a wide availability of products to patients is something that the whole industry would be interested in,” he said. But he warned that entering the PBM space was a “somewhat more difficult proposal” because Amazon would be deciding on whether patients could access specific drugs. However, some large US employers want to see Amazon do exactly that, arguing it is not possible to bring down the aggregate cost of medicines without having the power to ensure patients are actually prescribed cheaper alternatives in the first place, such as generics or rival branded drugs that cost less. “The problem in the US pharmacy system is that too many prescriptions are being written that are not right for the patient,” says Rob Andrews, chief executive of the Health Transformation Alliance, an alliance of 40 large employer-sponsored health plans, including IBM, American Express and Verizon. “Getting the wrong drug to the patient more efficiently is not the answer to that problem,” says Mr Andrews. “We don’t want to buy a discount seat on the Titanic.” Walgreens’ chief ‘has unfinished business’ If Amazon does decide to enter the pharmacy industry, some observers expect the online retailer’s biggest challenge to come from Stefano Pessina, the Italian billionaire and chief executive of Walgreens Boots Alliance. Mr Pessina sits atop one of the biggest forces in healthcare, having engineered a string of deals over several decades that saw him turn his small Italian wholesaler into a drugstore giant that owns the Walgreens chain in the US and Boots in the UK. Stefano Pessina is said to regard his foray into the US healthcare market as ‘unfinished business’ A former associate says it would be “wrong to count him out” if the pharmacy market were to enter a period of upheaval, pointing out that the consummate dealmaker had to recently abandon a takeover of Rite Aid after it was thwarted by regulators. (Mr Pessina had to content himself with buying a chunk of his smaller rival’s stores instead.) Another person who has advised Mr Pessina says the 76-year-old regards his foray into the US healthcare market as “unfinished business”. Although Mr Pessina has signed a string of agreements designed to consolidate the drug supply chain, he has not yet completed the kind of transformational deal that has become his hallmark. “Stefano is a visionary guy who engages in a lot of deal activity,” adds Leerink analyst Ana Gupte. A spokesperson for Mr Pessina declined to comment. Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2017. All rights reserved. You may share using our article tools.

       " 'German prosecutors raided Volkswagen AG ’s headquarters in an investigation of whether the carmaker’s leadership agreed to excessive payments to its top labor representative. The search is part of a probe into remuneration of works council chief Bernd Osterloh, a Volkswagen spokesman said late Tuesday by phone, declining to provide further details. Sascha Rueegg, a spokesman for prosecutors in Braunschweig, the legal administrative center for Volkswagen’s hometown of Wolfsburg, confirmed the raids on Wednesday. The investigation, which comes on top of various probes over the carmaker’s diesel-emissions cheating scandal, centers on allegations former and current management board members may have approved an inappropriately high compensation for Osterloh, the prosecutors’ office said in May. Company and labor spokesmen reiterated on Wednesday that the payments were in line with the law and had been reviewed by an external expert, and that Osterloh wasn’t personally a target of the probe. \"Prosecutors also raided the office of Bernd Osterloh, that seems to be a regular in these kind of proceedings,\" the VW works council said in an emailed statement. \"The state of affairs hasn’t changed: The probe doesn’t target Osterloh.\" The offices Chief Financial Officer Frank Witter and personnel director Karlheinz Blessing were searched along with Osterloh’s. While Osterloh isn’t a suspect, the probe comes at a delicate time for the works council head as it might taint his campaign to be re-elected early next year. Labor representatives have unusual sway at VW and Osterloh has been one of the most influential figures at the company over the past decade. Osterloh’s base salary is about 200,000 euros ($237,000) annually, while his highest total pay for a single year, including bonuses, was about 750,000 euros, a representative of the executive said in May. Last year, his total payment was about 500,000 euros, the representative said.',\n",
       " 'Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins said inflation pressures will be driven more over time by the country’s economic growth, rather than short-term swings in energy prices. Wilkins, speaking Wednesday in New York in a Bloomberg Television interview, said price pressures should start to rise as the economy continues to gather steam, and she reiterated the central bank will move cautiously on any future rate increases. “Growth on the other hand, you can look at very carefully as an indication of where the economy might be going in the future, where those wage pressures could be, how the labor market is going to perform, and that is what is going to be a longer-term driver of inflation pressures in the future,” Wilkins said, adding about 75 percent of the variability in total inflation is due to consumer energy prices. Policy makers raised Canada’s benchmark overnight lending rate to 1 percent, with consecutive hikes in July and September, to curb the fastest growth among Group of Seven nations and an economy close to full potential. Since the second increase, Wilkins and Governor Stephen Poloz have said further moves will depend on incoming data, as a stronger dollar and global slack keep inflation below their 2 percent target. Canada’s economy was “progressing quite strongly” earlier this year as policy makers raised rates, she said. “In October we were clear that we think over time that less monetary stimulus is likely to be appropriate, and at the same time we were going to be cautious about it,” she said. There is little sign of strong inflation pressures at the moment. The central bank isn’t forecasting a return to the 2 percent target until the second half of 2018. “As we look forward and we see that slack in the Canadian economy is being absorbed, well then that source of drag on inflation is going to go away,” Wilkins said. — With assistance by Josh Wingrove, and Theophilos Argitis',\n",

I‘ll use it in the future I don‘t think I‘ll use it Please tell us why (optional) Target shares briefly slid more than a tenth, on a day of declines for the benchmark S&amp;P 500 after the US retailer offered conservative guidance for the critical fourth-quarter holiday shopping season. Despite stronger than expected third-quarter profits, investors sold down their stakes in the big box retail chain as it stared down deep-pocketed rivals who are expected to increase discounts to lure shoppers and gain market share. Target shares dropped 9.9 per cent to $54.16 by close of trading on Wednesday. The company, which has focused on its own brand of cheap-chic offerings to help drive a sales turnround in recent quarters, said it expected adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter would range from $1.05 to $1.25 a share. That was largely below the median analyst forecast for $1.24 a share. “The pressure that we are anticipating is around digital fulfilment as well as all the work we continue to do around value,” Cathy Smith, the company’s chief financial officer, said on a call with Wall Street analysts. Like-for-like sales — a key industry metric — are forecast to grow as much as 2 per cent in the fourth quarter, buoyed by the company’s investments in store remodels and its ecommerce business. That could translate to full-year same-store sales growth between 0 and 1 per cent, above its earlier expectations. Overall sales rose 1.4 per cent from a year earlier to $16.7bn in the three months to the end of October 28. Profits slid 21 per cent from a year earlier to $480m, or 87 cents a share. Both sales and earnings exceeded analyst expectations. Target announced in March a plan to sacrifice $1bn of profit margin this year to better compete against Amazon on the ecommerce front and against Walmart and TJ Maxx on the price front. Among the initiatives that Target is taking include: focusing on higher margin categories such as furniture and kids decor through its own private brands such as Pillowfort and Threshold, as well as boosting its two-day delivery services by turning its stores into mini distribution centres. The company is also testing next-day home delivery of everyday household staples — from laundry detergent to paper towels — in an attempt to rival Amazon’s Pantry and Walmart’s Jet.com dominance in this area. It has also lowered prices permanently on a range of goods to drive foot traffic to its stores. Analysts with both JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs characterised the fourth-quarter guidance as “conservative”, although the former added that the company’s rising same-store sales were “encouraging”. The slide in Target shares accompanied a broader drop across stock indices. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.6 per cent to 2,564.62 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also declined 0.6 per cent to 23,271.28.

      "In its race to catch Amazon.com Inc. in online retailing, Walmart Inc. issued misleading e-commerce results and fired an executive who complained the company was breaking the law, according to a whistle-blower lawsuit. Walmart shares fell as much as 2 percent. Tri Huynh, a former director of business development at Walmart, claims he was terminated “under false pretenses” after repeatedly raising concerns about the company’s “overly aggressive push to show meteoric growth in its e-commerce business by any means possible -- even, illegitimate ones.” Under Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon, Walmart has invested billions to catch up with Amazon in e-commerce over the past few years, and last year enjoyed quarterly online sales growth rates surpassing 50 percent, well above peers that include Target Corp. and Best Buy Co. Huynh claims Walmart mislabeled products so that some third-party vendors received lower commissions, failed to process customer returns, and allowed offensive items onto the site. Huynh’s dismissal in January 2017 -- just a day after a retail-industry publication singled him out as one of the sector’s rising stars -- was in retaliation for warning senior executives about the misdeeds, he said in the lawsuit, filed Thursday by employment litigation attorney David M. deRubertis in San Francisco federal court. “Wal-Mart sacrificed and betrayed its founder’s key principles of integrity and honesty, pushing those core values aside in its rush to win the e-commerce war at all costs,” the 70-page complaint says, referring to founder Sam Walton. “In doing this, it realized it must silence any whistle-blower who spoke up against its ‘win at all costs’ approach.” Walmart officials weren’t immediately available for comment on the lawsuit. Digital Downshift Walmart's online expansion decelerated in its latest quarter Source: Walmart Note: Fiscal year ends Jan. 31 Along with the 2016 acquisition of Jet.com, the rollout of two-day free delivery and the recruitment of sought-after web engineers, Walmart’s strategy also includes building up its marketplace site, where third-party vendors sell their wares and pay the retailer a fee, usually around 15 percent. The number of products available on Walmart’s site has soared, from 7 million in 2015 to about 75 million as of February. Walmart overlooked basic internal controls in its quest for growth, according to the lawsuit. For example, Walmart’s systems sometimes failed to label marketplace items in the right product category, resulting in some vendors paying higher commissions than they should have. The company also failed to process customer returns on items totaling more than $7 million, which resulted in reporting inflated sales, Huynh said. Huynh, a native of Vietnam, joined Walmart in 2014 from Amazon. He claims he warned his superiors and the company’s ethics department that if “Walmart did not properly address these issues, its failure to do so could have serious long-term implications for its critically important e-commerce business.” He said he was told to stop raising such concerns, and when he eventually brought them to U.S. e-commerce chief Marc Lore in early 2017, he was “abruptly terminated” as part of a broader workforce reduction that took place later that month. Huynh sued accusing Walmart of whistle-blower retaliation in violation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, retaliation in violation of California labor code, failure to prevent discrimination, and wrongful termination. He seeks unspecified damages for lost wages and economic losses, special damages and punitive damages. The case is Huynh vs. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., 18-cv-01631, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).\n",
