knows how to put the romance into a honeymoon On December 13th thousands of people attended a free moonlit screening of Roma a Mexican film tipped for an Oscar next to the heliport of Los Pinos the residence of Mexicos presidents until Mr Lpez Obrador took over The culture ministry supplied popcorn and punch Mr Lpez Obrador or AMLO as he is known has swapped Los Pinos for more modest digs and opened it up to the public Rocio Bonilla a retired civil servant watched with her 86yearold mother who remembers the first presidential occupant of Los Pinos Lzaro Crdenas who took office in 1934 I never thought Id be allowed to come here says Ms Bonilla Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editors Picks While Mexicans huddled under blankets at the heliport AMLO was making the sort of decisions that can eventually spoil a honeymoon The veteran leftwing populist has begun to undo reforms of energy and education the two landmark achievements of his predecessor Enrique Pea Nieto Before the inauguration he spooked the financial markets by saying that he would stop Mexicos biggest infrastructure project a new airport for Mexico City At the same time he is travelling about the country launching others including a tourist train in southern Mexico and a refinery in his home state of Tabasco On December 15th AMLO presented a budget for 2019 giving Mexicans their first idea of the tradeoffs he is prepared to make in pursuit of his fourth transformation of Mexico which is supposed to uplift the poor make the economy more selfsufficient and reduce corruption and crime The budget shows that AMLO remains a populist but that he hopes to be a fiscally responsible one After the fright he gave the markets by cancelling the airport in response to a spurious vote badged as a consultation of the people that he held before taking office AMLO sought to reassure investors The finance minister Carlos Manuel Urza set a target for a primary surplus ie before interest payments of 1 of GDP after an expected 08 this year Although AMLO had suggested that preventing corruption would result in massive savings the budget does not rely on that unrealistic promise Instead he had to make some hard choices He has scaled back his plans for higher social spending although these remain ambitious He is speeding ahead with highprofile infrastructure projects which cost less money And he is bringing back the idea that the state should provide energy that is abundant and cheap He had planned to spend 125bn pesos 62bn about 05 of GDP on scholarships for the young That programme will get a little more than a third of that The budget allocates 60bn pesos of new money for a universal pension for old people 20bn pesos less than originally proposed To help pay for these stilllarge programmes the government will slash elsewhere in some departments by more than 20 An overhaul of migration policy will get little money Marcelo Ebrard the foreign minister announced spending of 5bn a year to discourage migration from Central America to the United Statespartly to please President Donald Trump This seems to be a repackaging of other promises to spend money in southern Mexico The austerity will not affect AMLO s favourite infrastructure projects On December 16th he attended an indigenous ceremony pictured in which he asked Mother Earth for permission to build the Maya tourist train Mother Earths advocates in government have yet to be consulted No environmental impact report on the project has been published the budget cuts funding for the environment ministry by a third AMLO is eager to start work on the refinery The budget includes 73bn pesos in extra funding for Pemex the stateowned oil company largely to pay for it This is part of his expensive scheme to make Mexico selfsufficient in energy AMLO s government has not torn up contracts already agreed with international oil companies an important part of Mr Peas energy reform But it plans to freeze auctions of rights to prospect for oil and gas for three years AMLO hopes to cut fuel prices once the new refinery is built Pemex which has a history of inefficiency and corruption is supposed to raise oil production by 50 during his sixyear term Congress which is dominated by AMLO s Morena party and its allies is debating measures to scrap Mr Peas education reform which sought to enforce higher standards of teaching in Mexicos terrible schools AMLO wants to make education free at all levels The costs of reversing Mr Peas reforms will become visible only gradually The government risks wasting billions in AMLO s attempt to restore to Pemex some of the glory it lost when Mr Pea ended its monopoly of oil extraction Cuts to fuel prices will eventually burden the budget Weaker accountability for teachers will lead to poorer performance by pupils The attempt to end the 13bn airport is causing immediate problems Work on the doomed project continues because the stateowned airport trust will have to repay 6bn of bonds when it is cancelled It does not have the money and AMLO does not want to pay out of the budget Bondholders rejected an offer by the government to buy back a third of the bonds at a discount and are unenthusiastic about a more generous offer Until a solution is found the cranes must continue to operate Continued construction of the airport and AMLO s conservative budget have soothed investors for now But the calm may not last long The budget assumes that the economy will grow by 2 next year but some privatesector economists expect the increase to be smaller A sharp drop in oil prices would upset the calculations on which the budget is based Mexicos supreme court has suspended a law that cuts the salaries of senior officials including judges and will rule in January on whether it violates public employees rights That pay cut would not save the government much money but it was a popular promise The court could inflict the first big defeat on AMLOS young government If that happens grab the popcorn This article appeared in the The Americas section of the print edition under the headline

get our Daily Dispatch and Editors Picks In 2017 the global zip market was reckoned to be worth 112 billion bigger than the market for condoms It is predicted to reach 198 billion by 2024 It is not growing because of exciting new uses just because of more luggage and clothes a boom in cheap disposable fashion and developingworld demand for Westernstyle clothing But if consumption is global the industry is not Remarkably up to 40 of the market by value may be controlled by one Japanese company YKK which makes more zips every year than there are people on the planet That the zip is relatively new and was slow to spread fits into the broader history of fastening It is an arena where innovation has been slow and fitfulsurpisingly so perhaps given peoples perennial need for clothes and luggage and their attachment to modesty and warmth Take the button As a decoration it can be dated back almost 5000 years to what is now Pakistan But for most of that time there were no buttonholes Many societies held things together with loops and toggles perhaps of horn Others used buckles The 11thcentury Bayeux Tapestry shows men in cloaks pinned at the neck with brooches Most people tied and wrapped Things got more interesting in Europes Middle Ages a period more innovative than it is often given credit for Laces started to make a strong showing in the 12thcentury They ran up the side of the bliaut the sweeping garment worn by both men and women they can be seen on the statues adorning Chartres Cathedral In the 13th century in Germany the button at last met its hole Then in 14thcentury Britain the earliest ancestor of the zip showed up the hook and eye Their appeal lay in fastening two edges smoothly with no need for them to overlap as buttons require or to be obviously laced They were and are fiddly flimsy little things but those who could afford them could afford to have someone else do the fiddling for them too These days they survive mostly as pointtopoint fastenings sometimes above a zip often on bras a development for which women can thank or remonstrate with Mark Twain The writer patented a hookandeye clasp on stretchy material in 1871 It was in that same era of unparalleled American industrial creativity that the zip was first produced Robert Friedel who has written a history of the zip calls it an unlikely invention Thomas Edisons lightbulb filament made the vital service of illumination both more powerful and soon much cheaper Alexander Graham Bells telephone made something previously impossible possible Though both had their belittlers plenty of people saw the need for such things and quickly seized on their potential When it came to the world of fasteners though Mr Friedel notes there was no general sense that this was an area begging for improvement much less replacement The Universal Fastener Company of Chicago was built around an innovation by Whitcomb Judson an oddball whose main obsession was developing a pneumatic streetcar driven by compressed air He imagined using a sliding guide to pull together a line of hooks and a line of eyes on a boot a notion that he patented in 1893 Alas the two sides of Judsons zip proved liable to come apart rather easily defeating its purpose Judson split too to further develop his nomoresuccessful streetcar The company was saved by Gideon Sundback an immigrant engineer from Sweden His developments were inspired it is said by two interleaved sets of soup spoons stacked bowl on bowl but with their handles pointing alternately to one side and the other and thus locked firmly together Ignoring the companys new namethe Automatic Hook and Eye Companyhe ditched the hooks and eyes and replaced them with todays design more or less two rows of metal protuberances with a tooth on one side and a socket on the other forced together and prised apart by a puller A similar design was patented by a Swiss woman named Katharina KuhnMoos around the same time but it was never manufactured Sundbacks improved zip proved hard to market not least because of the previous dud design It was used on utilitarian accessoriesmoney belts tobacco pouchesbut the rag trade proved resistant The first world war though gave the zip its break In 1918 the US Navy began to put them on its aviator jackets Then in 1923 BF Goodrich an American company best known for tyres put zips on its rubber galoshes It called the new footwear Zippers thus giving the devicepreviously the hookless fastenerits name The British for reasons unknown changed the name to zip But the device was still expensive and this impeded its progress When the companys salesmen found New York dressmakers resistant to the zips charms they invoked stereotypes of stingy Jews to explain their failure But what businessman or woman would pay 35 cents for a zip for a onedollar skirt when a button cost five cents The resistance was not just about dollars and cents though It was also about what the zip represented easy access unfettered undoability As late as the early 1930s it was seen as too strange and quite possibly too sexual to catch on especially on womens clothing Aldous Huxley in his novel Brave New World published in 1931 realised that this could regrettably end up as a feature not a bug The inhabitants of his dystopian World State wore zippicamiknicks and zippyjamas showing them simultaneously to be disturbingly modern and endlessly sexually available As a later novelist Tom Robbins put it Zippers are primal and modern at the very same time On the one hand your zipper is primitive and reptilian on the other mechanical and slickLittle alligators of ecstasy thats what zippers are What Huxley looked on with distastemodernity mass production copious and meaningless sex divorced from reproductionsounded quite appealing to others In 1930 Elsa Schiaparelli an avantgarde designer was the first dressmaker to feature prominent zips in her collections Wallis Simpson the lover and later wife of King Edward VIII was a fan The kings subsequent adoption of the zipped fly is credited with its popularity in Britain but young men were flocking to them everywhere In 1940 a survey at Princeton University found the trousers of 85 of its students were zipped not buttoned The class of 1894 by then in their 60s still kept their flies buttoned almost to a man After the war the zip took on a double life It could be an ostentatious statement of toughness rebellion even danger Think Marlon Brando in his leather jacket in The Wild One or later the zips which adorned the significantly less robust fashion of punk But in dressmaking it functioned as a near absence a slightly heavier seam which allowed clothing tighter than any since the days of corsets to be got intoand out of I can never get a zipper to close Rita Hayworth says suggestively to her onscreen husband in Gilda 1946 Maybe that stands for something What do you think The way in which dress design made zipping and unzipping joint activities added to the zips frisson And as Jess CartnerMorley a British fashion writer points out the postwar migration of the zip from the side of the dress to its back gave a stark signal about who was best placed for the unzipping It wasnt the wearer In Live and Let Die 1973 Roger Moore as James Bond goes so far as to unzip a womans dress behind her back without even touching it thanks to his handily magnetic watch Seen this way the barely noticeable zip reached its highest potential when it wasnt even there at all That is why the protagonist of Erica Jongs novel Fear of Flying published in 1973 calls the nopowergames consummately easy consummately pure sex she longs for the zipless fuck I can never get a zipper to closemaybe that stands for something What do you think The tough and macho side and the sexualaccess side of the zip could naturally fit together Witness the real metal zip with which the denim crotch on the cover of the Rolling Stones album Sticky Fingers was adorned Punks zips were as closely related to those of the fetish scene as they were to icons of the 1950s If the sexiness of zips mostly lay in getting out of your clothes for a minority it lay in getting into themzips could do up garments of rubber or PVC deliciously tight There were still doubters especially when it came to flies Having metal teeth in delicate places is not without its worries As Jerry Seinfeld a comedian once quipped Its a mink trap down there Some felt buttons still made a statement And some just worried about the zips reliability Ronald Reagan said he would only ever wear a button fly because he was afraid of accidental openingsa reasonable concern for an actor and for a president Once near universal did the zip mutate into ever better forms fit for ever more markets No There have been innovations plastic teeth to replace metal ones the coil zip using continuous spirals of nylon to form the teeth making them more flexible and lightweight But much of the focus has simply been on improving quality Precision in zip manufacture is everything Misalignment as thin as a piece of paper can cause jams A broken zip unlike a lost button often leads to a garment being discarded The improvements have been almost exclusively led by YKK which guarantees that each of its zips will last for 10000 uses Tadao Yoshida the zipper king founded the company in 1934 but had to start again after his Tokyo factory was bombed in the second world war Soon the postwar company had gained a reputation for quality and reliability outside Japan When Sundbacks patents expired in 1960 YKK expanded into America Talon the descendant of the original Universal Fastener Company faded before the onslaught As the garment industry moved offshore the Japanese zips followed The company now operates in 73 countries with much of its production in China YKK has developed zips that are waterproof heat resistant and that glow in the dark The heart of Japanese business is the concept of kaizen or continual improvement and Hiroaki Otani YKK s boss says the company is investing heavily in R amp D But the improvements seem to be much more in process than in the product What more is there for the zip to do Wouldnt people like to do up a zip on the back of the dress with a touch on their smartphone offers Mr Otani musingly Leaving aside the risk of hackers and James Bonds colleague Q it is not clear that this will become much of a market If the main function has not changed it is then about how to apply it in different circumstances and products says Patarapong Intarakumnerd a professor of innovation in Tokyo Some doctors for example speak longingly of a zip that can replace stitches after operations where they may need to access the same part of the patients body again Radical innovation often comes from outside the dominant industry points out Mr Intarakumnerd Smartphones came from computer makers like Apple not phone companies Maybe some nonclothing nonluggage industry will find a reason to reinvent and reimplement the zip Meanwhile there are still bits of the wardrobe the zip has yet to conquer Why for example are shirts still mostly buttoned or even poppered when they seem an obvious candidate for zipperdom There is no clear answer says Mr Friedel He thinks fastenings establish niches through customs functionality advertising and more and then they become custom And custom has in this area left the zip with very few rivals Velcro the most notable new fastening of the 20th century inspired by the burrs of a plant has limited appeal It is used mainly for children and the elderly It allows a range of fits which is handy particularly in footware But it has its drawbacks since the American army adopted it for uniforms in 2004 soldiers posted in dusty Iraq and Afghanistan have complained that it copes poorly with sand And besides there is not the beauty the smooth silent sophisticated upanddown of the zip And the zip does not really have to improve or be replaced Sometimes too much stress is put on progress The technologies that matter most are not the ones around the corner They are the ones in massive use The zip was not born of radical new science or cunning craft nor even of any deep need Now that it is established it says much less than it once did about sex rebellion and modernity It is unlikely to solve any of the worlds major problems It was simply a clever way of making something a bit easier that happened to catch on In that sense it is like thousands of workaday inventions that shift from novelty to necessity without much song and dance and end up hard to better This article appeared in the Christmas Specials section of the print edition under the headline Alligators of

FacebookAmazonApple five1020 billion euros delete as applicable There are plenty of things we already know will happen in 2019 but what are the real black swans the events that no one is thinking about but that will genuinely rock the markets over the next 12 monthsTrump might hand over to his vicepresident Daimler could merge with Volkswagen Emmanuel Macron could launch a parallel franc the tech giants could start to consolidate and the Greens could take power in Berlin Any of those really would be a game changer and would catch just about everyone off guardEvery year throws up at least a couple of curveballs events that werent on anyones radar but that have the power to reshape industries or economies No one really expected a bizarre leaderless RightLeft protest movement to convulse France or the crypto currencies to collapse in value or that Carlos Ghosn the boss of RenaultNissan would be arrested in Japan triggering the potential unravelling of the auto industrys biggest and most powerful industrial alliance So what could be lurking below the surface to take us all by surprise in 2019 Here are five possibilitiesDonald Trump hands over the keys to the White House With the first primaries of the 2020 presidential race only a year away there is already plenty of speculation about who the Democrats might pick to run against Trump and indeed whether any senior Republicans will decide to challenge him for the nomination But who says he is really running One thing we know for sure about Trump is that he is a maverick selfobsessed egotist who is hardly even a politician and has the attention span of a toddler with a tantrum Amid mounting scandals and investigations with threats of impeachment and with a looming recession and bear market tarnishing his legacy The Donald could decide he was ready to spend more time on his casinos golf courses and reality TV shows and pass the gig on to his vicepresident Mike PenceA megamerger in the German car industry Chinas fastgrowing and aggressive Geely has already built up a near 10 per cent stake in Daimler the manufacturer of Mercedes Is there a point to that holding Only if it decides to launch a full bid one day With the DAX in a bear market and all the automakers under pressure from the rise of electric and selfdriving vehicles there may never be a better time to make a strike The trouble is the German government will never allow the jewel in its industrial crown to fall into the hands of the Chinese Berlin will orchestrate a hurried merger with Volkswagen to create the worlds largest car manufacturer and one in which the state retains a controlling interest It is unlikely that will work in the longterm  but it will certainly keep the Chinese at bayA French surprise It is hard to think of a more beleaguered figure than Frances Emmanuel Macron His approval ratings have been shattered the economy is stalling and his plans for reforming the eurozone have come to nothing And yet he has a flair for the unexpected Why not steal an idea from the populists on the other side of the Alps and launch a parallel franc Paper IOUs backed by the government much as proposed for Italy would allow him to increase benefits and public spending and reflate a stalling economy without breaking eurozone budget rules Coupled with his reforms it might even kickstart French growth A risk For sure But it might be better than a couple more dismal years of protests and austerity then defeat in 2022A radically proenvironment government taking charge of Europes largest economy would be a shock to businessThe consolidation of the technology industry After a quarter century of stunning growth a combination of mounting regulatory pressure and managerial exhaustion means that expansion will suddenly become a lot harder The response Start a round of mergers Amazon could buy Spotify and Uber while Apple buys Tesla and Netflix and Googles parent Alphabet takes control of Facebook The result Bigger although not necessarily better companies with formidable powers to generate cash for their shareholdersA surprise in Berlin With the collapse of the Social Democratic Party the Greens are becoming the main centreleft force in Germany getting close to 20 per cent in some recent polls If Angela Merkels fragile grand coalition collapses that will trigger fresh elections and the Greens could emerge as the secondlargest party Crucially it may be the only one capable of forming a coalition combining with the rump of the Social Democrats and the Left Party A radically proenvironment government taking charge of Europes largest economy would be a shock to business  as would the raft of new taxes and controls a Greenled administration would introduceOf course there are many other things that might surprise us in 2019 The UK might cancel Brexit The African National Congress might lose power in South Africa Brazils new president Jair Bolsonaro might finally unlock the economic potential of that vast country while investors might finally discover Poland the first country to upgrade to developed market status in a generation All we can be sure of is that plenty of things will happen and very few of them will have been foreseen

leave this year out of Amazons STeam a tightknit group of senior leaders that see very little turnoverDiego Piacentini one of the most senior executives at Amazon who had previously led its international business has left the company after a twoyear hiatus adding to a string of executive departures over the past yearPiacentini who went on a twoyear leave in 2016 to work with the Italian government has decided not to return to the company after his project came to an end in October according to a person familiar with the matterThe Italyborn executive was considered one of CEO Jeff Bezoss top lieutenants during his 16year tenure at Amazon reporting directly to himand becoming part of his tightknit group of senior leaders called the STeam He joined Amazon from Apple and reportedly drew the scorn of thenCEO Steve Jobs for joining a boring retailerPiacentini was also one of the largest employee shareholders at Amazon Before he left in 2016 he owned the third largest number of Amazon shares among all employees after only Bezos and the retail groups CEO Jeff Wilke according to the companys 2017 proxy statement The 79146 shares he owned at the time would translate to roughly 122 million based on yesterdays closing pricePiacentini previously hinted that he could come back to Amazon once his pro bono work with the Italian government was complete In an interview with the Financial Times in September 2017 he said he planned to return to the ecommerce company although he noted that many things can change During a Bloomberg interview this year he declined to say whether hes returning to AmazonIts unclear what his future plans are now He didnt respond to a request for comment Amazon declined to comment for this storyPiacentini joins a growing list of executives that have left Amazon this year even as the company enjoys unprecedented success and a nearrecord stock price At least 15 highprofile executives have announced their departures this year an unusually high number for a company known for retaining its most senior executives for many yearsPiacentinis departure is particularly notable given that hes the second STeam member to leave Amazon this year after marketplace SVP Sebastian Gunningham left in March Bezoss STeam which reportedly contains fewer than 20 execs is famous for seeing very little turnover historically a part of Amazons culture that the CEO once highlighted during an internal staff meetingIm very happy that we dont have a lot of turnover on the Steam Bezos said according to a recording of a 2017 allhands meeting that CNBC has heard I dont intend to change that I like you guys a lot I would expect any transition there to happen very incrementally over a long period of timeCashing inAmazons massive success has made it a popular poaching ground for executive talent Many of the departed executives had more than a decade of experience building key parts of Amazons business and have joined hot startups or young public companies that would benefit from the adult guidance these experienced leaders could provide In return these people get fresh opportunities and a relief from the more bureaucratic culture of a big companyFor example Gunningham who spent over 10 years at Amazon took the vice chairman role at WeWork Greg Greeley another highlyregarded executive responsible for building the Prime membership program left to join Airbnb in March Tim Stone former VP of finance is now Snaps chief finance officer Other companies that recruited Amazons executives this year include SoFi Tesla and RobinhoodGene Munster managing partner at Loup Ventures said the departures are more a symptom of success than a sign of turmoil at Amazon Many of them are likely motivated by Amazons soaring stock price which nearly quadrupled over the past five years he said because it gives these people incentive to sell their stock which in most cases are worth millions of dollars and the flexibility to pursue new opportunitiesThese executives are cashing in on their past success and often parlaying them into startup careers Munster saidWhile its true that many of the executives have become incredibly rich and have left on their own volition not all departures seem to have been voluntary according to James Thomson a former Amazon manager and partner at BuyBox Experts who works closely with the company Amazon often reviews its organizational structure and pushes out executives when necessary he said and its possible the company saw layers of overlapping VP positions that needed to be streamlined after its workforce grew to over 610000 this yearEither way the void left by these executives shouldnt be a concern for Amazon Thomson added because of its deep bench of talented executives who can fill in those positions immediatelyThese people are expensive to pay and quite frankly it doesnt make any sense to have too many of them if you dont need them all Thomson said But Amazon will be fine

But it has also sharpened an urban-rural divide that, some say, threatens growth. Columnist Christopher Mims explores the phenomenon",https://www.wsj.com/articles/where-you-should-move-to-make-the-most-money-americas-superstar-cities-11544850010,2018-12-15 05:09:31,Technology is creating an economy in which superstar employees work for superstar firms that gather them into superstar cities leading to a stark geographic concentration of wealth unlike any seen in the past century The latest example of this is Apple announcing this past week a billiondollar investment in a new campus that could ultimately accommodate up to 15000 employees in a city already red hot with talent Austin Texas That follows Amazons recent choice to put its two new headquarters in existing superstar cities New York and Washington DC When economists talk about superstar anything theyre referencing a phenomenon first described in the early 1980s It began as the product of mass media and was put into overdrive by the internet In an age when the reach of everything we make is greater than ever members of an elite class of bankers chief executives programmers Instagram influencers and just about anyone with indemand technical skills have seen their incomes grow far faster than those of the middle class In this winnertakeall economy the superstar firmsthink Apple Google and Amazon but also their increasingly hightech equivalents in finance health care and every other industryappear to account for most of the divergence in productivity and profits between companies in the US As firms cluster around talent and talent is in turn drawn to those firms the result is a selfreinforcing trend toward everricher evercostlier metro areas that are economically dominant over the rest of the country Ironically the internet that many of the firms power isnt helping While it was supposed to erase distance it cant yet replace highquality facetoface communication required for rapidfire innovation Members of the Federal Reserve among others have warned that the rise of geographic inequality and a deepening urbanrural divide threaten growth in the US This has led some to declare that rural America is the new inner city plagued by poverty drugs and deaths of despair Similar patterns of migration of wealth to cities appear to be playing out all over the world For most of the 20th century this divide did not exist Something changed in 1980 says Mark Muro a senior fellow and director of the metropolitan policy program at the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution What happened was the introduction of the PC He adds Until about then metros were becoming more like each other Incomes were converging and industries were becoming more distributed across place From the early 1970s through the 1980s companies like IBM Digital Equipment Corp and Apple used mainframes minicomputers and eventually PCs to make companiesand the first technologically adept superstar workersmore productive Mr Muro calls it the first wave of the digitalization of work The internet was supposed to lead to a golden age of distributed workforces In some ways it did The proportion of workers who do their jobs remotely is now at least 20 and growing But superstar firms continue to insist that their topperforming employees cluster in global headquarters or at least regional offices costs and congestion be damned Facebook s new office is literally the worlds largest openplan workspace even though workers generally hate them Apples new HQ in California was designed from the ground up to force people to bump into each other and collaborate Amazon could have saved a bundle by creating an entirely virtual HQ2 After all themostly onlinetools for identifying tech talent work anywhere and can spot a great coder in Arkansas or India But even the most modern communication technologies are limited They cant carry as much information as a reallife facetoface collaboration Slack email and instant messaging are famous for their inability to convey tone and the resulting crossed wires  The internet cant yet replace the facetoface communication required for rapidfire innovation  The more a firm is dependent on innovationthat is leveraging technology to be the absolute best at what it doesthe more intense the collaboration of its superstar employees Famously Googles only two Level 11 engineers on a scale of 1 to 10 code by sitting next to one another staring at the same screen and working on a single keyboard Technologists who employ both remote workers and people collected into an office have debated and analyzed the phenomenon at great length Their own experience boils down to this bon mot from venture capitalist Marc Andreessen Theres a huge premium to being 10 better at executing meaning that while it can be a pain to bring workers to a central office its worth it even if it leads to an incremental gain in productivity Johnathan Nightingale former vice president of Firefox at Mozila has pointed out that while remote work can be sustainable anything that slows down a startup in the critical first few years can mean losing to a faster competitor Whether or not this is the case its become such an accepted way of thinking in tech that companieseven big ones that only think like a startup obey it as if it were a law Attempts to turn cities outside of Silicon Valley into superstar cities by making them tech hubs have met with mixed success Metro areas succeed when they capitalize on their existing talents One reason Amazon chose Nashville Tenn for a big regional office says Mr Muro could be that its already a hub for medical IT and digital patient records Using data from timeuse surveys conducted by the federal government Mr Muro and his colleagues created an index of every metro area in the US ranking them by how much workers in each use computers to accomplish their jobs This yields a measure of the digitalization of every job industry and city surveyed The results include both exactly what you would expectSilicon Valley is No 1and some illustrative surprises Salt Lake City home to the Silicon Slopes is No 12 on the list right behind the tech hub of San Francisco and ahead of techhappy Seattle Austin where Apple is expanding is No 9 on the list Unlike other rankings from realestate prices to venturecapital investment the Brookings index shows us not only which cities have done well and become unaffordable It also shows which stillaffordable ones should by the superstar logic do well in the future Not everyone agrees that technology is a primary driver of geographic inequality Stacy Mitchell codirector of the nonprofit Institute for Local SelfReliance argues that many of these trends are better explained by changes in policy which since the early 1980s have in many distinct ways given large companies free rein to merge dominate markets pursue government subsidies and tax breaks and in general grow larger at the expense of small medium and local businesses In particular the 1982 merger guidelines are very specific in that the only thing that matters when considering antitrust is economic efficiency which is translated into consumer welfare and low prices she adds The cities with the most startups and investment tend to see more business formation but a longterm challenge lurks If a superstar city becomes too large the service workers who arent benefiting from the boom will be priced out In the end this might limit the size of these citiesat least until many of those workers are replaced by robots For more WSJ Technology analysis reviews advice and headlines

bank’s business",https://www.ft.com/content/26ff2dc2-02a2-11e9-99df-6183d3002ee1,2018-12-18 13:15:37,Malaysia is to pursue criminal charges against Goldman Sachs units based in the UK Singapore and Hong Kong in connection with 65bn worth of bonds the investment bank arranged for 1Malaysia Development Berhad the state investment fund at the centre of the biggest financial scandal in the countrys history The move by Malaysia to target a trio of Goldmans businesses outside its borders suggests prosecutors seeking redress for the debacle will face tortuous legal proceedings in pressing their case as they seek to serve court orders in three foreign countries according to charge sheets published by Malaysias attorneygeneral The charges also cast a wider net over Goldman and its global business which market experts said could threaten the US banks reputation if the charges were to result in prosecution Goldman Sachs International based in London Goldman Sachs Singapore PTE and Goldman Sachs Asia LLC which is registered in Delaware but based in Hong Kong were all named in the charge sheets which were published on Tuesday The bank said that none of the three entities had yet been served with a legal summons for the case a court date for which has been set in March Nizam Ismael a Singaporebased partner at RHTLaw Taylor Wessing said You might hear of banks having issues with regulators in terms of not meeting regulatory requirements that happens frequently But for an investment bank to face charges and criminal charges for that mattero suggest that there was some collusion to perpetrate fraud these are very serious allegations A corporate lawyer who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the case said If convicted they would receive the penalty of a fine but more significant is that by having a criminal record it would make it difficult to get a licence to operate or keep existing licences Malaysias attorneygeneral announced the charges on Monday saying he would seek to impose steep fines and jail sentences of up to 10 years against the bank and two former Goldman employees Tim Leissner and Roger Ng Chong Hwa alleging they conspired with two 1MDB officials to bribe public officials to secure the bond mandates However no indictment was published against Mr Ng as of Tuesday afternoon Prosecutors also alleged that Goldmans underwriting and arranging fees of about 600m were several times higher than the prevailing market rates and industry norms They said they would seek the imposition of criminal fines well in excess of the amount they allege was stolen from 1MDB and the 600m Goldman received Goldman hit back at the accusations alleging that members of former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razaks government and 1MDB lied to the bank lawyers and others about the use of proceeds from the bonds 1MDB whose CEO and board reported directly to the prime minister at the time also provided written assurances for Goldman Sachs for each transaction that no intermediaries were involved said a Goldman spokesman Under the Malaysian legal process the firm was not afforded an opportunity to be heard prior to the filing of these charges against certain Goldman Sachs entities which we intend to vigorously contest The bank said the criminal charges do not affect our ability to conduct our current business globally A spate of criminal charges against international banks in recent years has reduced fears that such a step would prove highly damaging or even fatal to an institutions ability to operate A spokesman for the Federal Reserve Goldmans primary regulator could not immediately say what local implications a foreign conviction would carry for a US company If Goldman were convicted of a crime by US courts it could face restrictions on working with certain institutional investors such as pension funds though companies have gotten around these in the past by obtaining waivers from the US Department of Labor However Asiabased analysts said a successful criminal prosecution could affect its business Goldman is trying to increase its presence in China and as is the case for most jurisdictions when you try to apply for licences regulators say you have to satisfy capital requirements but also the entity applying needs to have not been sanctioned or convicted in the past five or so years said a consultant in the industry So by suing three entities thats a wide net thats really going to hurt Goldman Goldman earns about 14 per cent of its net revenue from Asia according to its latest quarterly results compared with about 60 per cent for its core US business The Malaysian case announced on Monday is the latest twist in the 1MDB scandal which saw Mr Leissner strike a deal with US prosecutors last month in which he pleaded guilty to money laundering and bribing foreign officials and agreed to forfeit 437m However it represents the first time Goldman has been charged with a crime abroad

December 1st knows how to put the romance into a honeymoon On December 13th thousands of people attended a free moonlit screening of Roma a Mexican film tipped for an Oscar on the heliport of Los Pinos the residence of Mexicos presidents until Mr Lpez Obrador took over The culture ministry supplied popcorn and punch Mr Lpez Obrador or AMLO as he is known has swapped Los Pinos for more modest digs and opened it up to the public Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editors Picks Rocio Bonilla a retired civil servant watched with her 86yearold mother who remembers the first presidential occupant of Los Pinos Lzaro Crdenas took office in 1934 I never thought Id be allowed to come here says Ms Bonilla While Mexicans huddled under blankets at the heliport AMLO was making the sort of decisions that can eventually spoil a honeymoon The veteran leftwing populist has begun to undo reforms of energy and education the two landmark achievements of his predecessor Enrique Pea Nieto Before the inauguration he spooked the financial markets by saying that he would stop Mexicos biggest infrastructure project an international airport in Mexico City At the same time he is travelling about the country launching others including a tourist train in southern Mexico and a refinery in his home state of Chiapas On December 15th AMLO presented a budget for 2019 giving Mexicans their first idea of the tradeoffs he is prepared to make in pursuit of his fourth transformation of Mexico which is supposed to uplift the poor make the economy more selfsufficient and reduce corruption and crime The budget shows that AMLO remains a populist but that he hopes to be a fiscally responsible one After the fright he gave the markets by cancelling the airport in response to a spurious vote badged as a consultation of the Mexican people that he held before even taking office AMLO sought to reassure investors The finance minister Carlos Manuel Urza raised the target for a primary surplus ie before interest payments from 08 of GDP to 1 Although AMLO had suggested that preventing corruption would result in massive savings the budget does not rely on that unrealistic promise Instead he had to make some hard choices At the outset at least AMLO is giving a higher priority to economic nationalism and the infrastructure projects that go along with that than to the socialspending side of his programme His plan to give scholarships to young people got a little more than a third of the money he had originally envisaged for it The budget allocates 100bn pesos 5bn about 04 of GDP for a universal pension for old people 20bn pesos less than originally promised Most government departments face cuts Ambitious plans to overhaul migration policy will get little money On December 12th Marcelo Ebrard the foreign minister announced spending of 5bn a year to discourage migration from Central America to the United Statesa gesture to please President Donald Trump The money seems to be a repackaging of existing spending in southern Mexico Mr Ebrard hopes to convince the United States to spend more money in Central America itself to encourage potential migrants to stay home but there is little sign of that Where AMLO does plan to splash out at least somewhat is on his favourite infrastructure projects On December 16th he attended an indigenous ceremony in which he asked Mother Earth for permission to build the Maya tourist train He seems to think it less urgent to consult environmental officials The government has yet to publish an environmental impact report on the project and the budget cuts funding for the environment ministry by a third AMLO is eager to start work on the refinery The budget includes 23bn pesos in extra funding for Pemex the stateowned oil company to pay for it This is part of his expensive scheme to make Mexico selfsufficient in energy reversing Mr Peas opening of the sector Although AMLOs government has not torn up contracts already agreed with international oil companies it cancelled the auctions of drilling rights that were scheduled for February It is unclear what will happen to ambitious plans to build pipelines to increase imports of natural gas from the United States Pemex which has a history of inefficiency and corruption is supposed to raise oil production by 50 during AMLOs sixyear term His dream of selfsufficiency is a hermetic view of the energy sector says Duncan Wood of the Mexico Institute a thinktank in Washington Congress which is dominated by AMLOs Morena party and its allies is debating measures to scrap Mr Peas education reform which sought to enforce higher standards of teaching in Mexicos terrible schools The costs of reversing Mr Peas reforms will become visible only gradually The government risks wasting billions in AMLOs attempt to restore to Pemex some of the glory it lost when its monopoly of the oil sector ended The young will suffer from AMLOs plans to weaken accountability for teachers The attempt to end the 13bn airport is causing immediate problems Work on the doomed project continues because the airport trust a stateowned body will have to repay 6bn of bonds when it is cancelled It does not have this money and the president does not want to burden the budget with that cost Bondholders rejected an offer by the government to buy back a third of the bonds at a discount and then turned down a second more generous offer Until a solution is found the cranes must continue to operate Continued construction of the airport and AMLOs conservative budget have soothed investors for now But the calm may not last long The budget assumes that the economy will grow by 2 next year but some privatesector economists expect the increase to be smaller A sharp drop in oil prices would upset the calculations on which the budget is based Mexicos supreme court has suspended a law that cuts the salaries of senior officials including judges and will rule in January on whether it violates public employees rights That pay cut will not save the government much money but it was one of AMLOs most popular promises The court could inflict the first big defeat on his young government If that happens grab the popcorn

December,https://www.ft.com/content/c8e2a308-0e96-11e9-a3aa-118c761d2745,2019-01-04 18:03:34,The US Federal Reserve surprised the markets when they failed to indicate a pause in monetary tightening at their policy meeting in December In retrospect that was probably a mistake and the chairman Jay Powell has now responded to severe market pressure by indicating that the Federal Open Market Committee may pause further tighteningSince the December meeting markets had been indicating that the Feds probable policy stance in 2019 would be too tight to deliver on the central banks mandate of maximum employment with price stability defined as 2 per cent inflationOn this interpretation the Fed had made an error by tightening too much Annoyingly for believers in rational economic analysis President Donald Trumps critical tweets about Fed policy were not entirely wrong about that and on Friday Mr Powell implicitly admitted as muchTwo shocks hit the US and global markets towards the end of 2018 The first was a contractionary demand shock from China confirmed by the recent sharp declines in nowcasts for that economy this led to downgrades in global activity forecasts with a drop in US business surveys and inflation data The second was that the Fed largely ignored these developments leaving its policy guidance basically unchanged in December The key result of these two shocks has been a major downgrade in the markets view of inflation risks over the relevant horizon for monetary policy see box below There has also been a large rise in real bond yields Higher real rates with lower inflation indicate that the markets were pricing tighter monetary policy than is needed to hit the inflation target Shades of the 201516 turbulenceAs Mr Powell said on Friday this episode is quite similar to market behaviour after December 2015 when the Fed raised interest rates for the first time in the current hiking cycle despite weakness in both the US and Chinese economiesMarkets certainly did not welcome that rate increase and financial conditions tightened markedly By the beginning of February 2016 the severity of market turbulence made the Feds position untenable The key change came on 3 February when Bill Dudley then president of the New York Fed said that the tightening had become so extensive that it would inevitably have damaging effects on the US economyReal bond yields quickly subsided while inflation expectations bounced back With fears of deflation abating asset prices embarked on a twoyear extension of their great bull runMr Powell has been reluctant to to adjust policy this time This is because there are some important differences between early 2016 and the present situationFirst in 2016 the US nowcast for activity growth dipped to about 1 per cent before the Fed blinked Currently it is still at 25 per cent so the slowdown in activity is much less severe Second although China has slowed almost as much as it did in 2016 there is much less market concern about a destabilising devaluation of the renminbi in 2019Third the US labour market is far tighter than it was three years ago with unemployment now well below the natural rateThis final reason has probably made the Fed staff much less willing to support a dovish move than they were when there was plenty of slack left in the economy I believe that the staff may have less empathy with Mr Powell a lawyer than with the formally trained economists that preceded him and may have been worried that he would cave in too readily to pressures from the president to ease policy In fact the staff may have been working overtime to persuade the chairman to slow an economy that they fear is overheating substantially This could have created a bias towards tighter policy than Mr Powell might have preferred On Friday he was more his own manThere are two ways this episode could end A good conclusion would be reached if US growth remains firm which remains Mr Powells central expectation The markets would then eventually accept that the central bank is right about growth inflation and the need for appropriate rises in policy ratesA less happy alternative is that market turbulence continues and contributes to a further weakening in growth and inflation projections On this scenario Jay Powell will have to follow the example of Janet Yellen in 2016 and almost completely remove the bias towards additional tightening that existed in the Feds December policy guidance He took a large step though not the whole way towards acknowledging that on Friday The markets will take noteSignals from US inflation and real yieldsUS inflation has surprised on the low side in the second half of 2018 but the FOMC has cut its inflation forecasts only slightly for the coming yearInflation expectations in the financial markets eg breakeven inflation in the TIPs or inflationindexed bonds market have dropped substantially as the economy has slowedHowever with the FOMC continuing to suggest that it remains on course to raise policy rates this year real interest rates have continued to riseThe decline in inflation expectations combined with unchanged real rates is a signal that the markets believe a monetary tightening shock has occurred Markets think that monetary policy has been tighter than it should be but that should correct after Jay Powells latest remarks

as Brazils president on Tuesday and immediately called on Congress to combat endemic corruption and promised to work tirelessly so that Brazil reaches its destinyAddressing a joint session of Congress minutes after taking the oath of office Bolsonaro a former Army captain and admirer of the countrys 19641985 military dictatorship vowed to adhere to democratic normsHe said his government would be guided by the promises he made to Brazilian voters fed up with graft high levels of violent crime and a stillsputtering economyI will work tirelessly so that Brazil reaches its destiny Bolsonaro said after being sworn in My vow is to strengthen Brazils democracyUS President Donald Trump lauded Bolsonaros speech in a tweet saying the USA is with youTrump tweetThe new Brazilian president promptly replied on Twitter thanking Trump for his encouragement and saying Together under Gods protection we shall bring prosperity and progress to our peopleBolsonaro tweetOn the economic front Bolsonaro promised in his inauguration speech to create a new virtuous cycle to open markets and carry out important structural reforms to shore up a yawning public deficitBolsonaro 63 was a seventerm fringe congressman who rode a wave of antiestablishment anger to became Brazils first farright president since a military dictatorship gave way to civilian rule three decades agoBolsonaro plans to realign Brazil internationally moving away from developing nation allies and closer to the policies of Western leaders particularly US President Donald Trump who sent Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to his inaugurationAs a clear sign of that diplomatic shift Bolsonaro plans to move the Brazilian embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem breaking with Brazils traditional support for a twostate solution to the Palestinian issueCrowds of supporters many with the Brazilian flag draped around their shoulders and with faces painted yellow and green the national colors gathered before the Planalto palace where later Tuesday the presidential sash will be draped on BolsonaroBacked massively by conservative sectors of Brazil including Christian evangelical churches Bolsonaro would block moves to legalize abortion beyond even the current limited exceptions and remove sex education from public schools opposing what he calls cultural Marxism introduced by recent leftist governmentsOnethird of his cabinet are former army officers mostly fellow cadets at the Black Needles academy Brazils West Point all outspoken backers of the countrys 19641985 military regimeBolsonaro has faced charges of inciting rape and for hate crimes because of comments about women gays and racial minorities Yet his lawandorder rhetoric and plans to ease gun controls have resonated with many voters especially in Brazils booming farm countryIn an interview with Record TV on the eve of his inauguration Bolsonaro lashed out at Brazils notorious bureaucracy which makes doing business in the country difficult and expensive He vowed to strip away the socalled Brazil Cost that hamstrings private enterpriseThe government machine is really heavy he said There are hundreds of bureaucratic governing bodies across Brazil of regulators as well  We have to untangle the messHis vow to follow Trumps example and pull Brazil out of the Paris Agreement on climate change has worried environmentalists So have his plans to build hydroelectric dams in the Amazon and open up to mining the reservations of indigenous peoples who are seen as the last custodians of the worlds biggest forestBrazilian businesses are eager to see Bolsonaro take office and install a team of orthodox economists led by investment banker Paulo Guedes who has promised quick action in bringing Brazils unsustainable budget deficit under controlGuedes plans to sell as many state companies as possible in a privatization drive that he forecasts could eventually bring in up to 1 trillion reais 257 billionThat would help restore order to government finances The key measure however for reducing the deficit and stopping a dangerous rise of Brazils public debt will be the overhaul of the countrys costly social security pension systemPension reform will be Bolsonaros biggest challenge since he has yet to build a base in Congress where he has eschewed the political horsetrading that has traditionally helped Brazilian presidents govern the nation of nearly 210 million peopleBolsonaro may find that lax protection of the environment and human rights could have negative economic effects more so than those faced by other farright leaders given the spotlight on Brazils Amazon jungle as a protection against global warming and because the country has more murders than any other nationI think they will be good on the economy and they will probably be bad for human rights and the environment said Brian Winter vice president for policy at the Americas Society and Council of the Americas in New YorkThe key question is whether those things can be separated Most of Wall Street says Yes I have my doubts

Reuters  A third Canadian has been detained in China following the arrest of a Chinese technology executive in Vancouver a Canadian government official said on Wednesday amid a diplomatic dispute also involving the United StatesThe detentions of the Canadians followed the Dec 1 arrest in Vancouver of Meng Wanzhou chief financial officer of the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd  at the request of the United States which is engaged in a trade war with ChinaOur primary and singleminded focus is always what is in the best interests of Canadians and in particular what is in the best interest of Canadians being held Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said at a news conferenceAsked why the government had not done more to have the Canadians released he said Political posturing or political statements arent necessarily going to contribute  They might actually hinder Canadians release Were going to take every situation carefully and seriouslyCanadians understand that even though political posturing might be satisfactory in the short term to make yourself  feel like youre stomping on a table and doing something significant it may not directly contribute to the outcome we all want which is for these Canadians to come home safely Trudeau addedNo details have been given on the latest detention but Trudeau said that it was a very separate case from last week when former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor were detained amid the diplomatic quarrel triggered by Mengs arrestHuawei is the worlds biggest supplier of telecoms network equipment and secondbiggest smartphone seller The United States has been looking since at least 2016 into whether Huawei shipped USorigin products to Iran and other countries in violation of US export

sensitivity of the situationA second source said Canada was concerned that the detainees were in the hands of the powerful security authoritiesEven if there were voices of reason in the Chinese system saying Are you crazy The Canadian government cannot order a judge to release Ms Meng the security voices are going to trump them the source saidPhilip Calvert a former diplomat in China and now a research fellow at the University of Victoria said at least the first two detentions were indicative of the way China often engages internationally in situations like thisThe people making the

daily newsletterUpgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editors PicksA calm assessment of the Trump era requires those who admire America to unplug themselves from the news cycle for a minute As the next phase of the presidents fouryear term begins three questions need answering How bad is it really How bad could it get And how should Americans and foreign governments prepare for the Trump Shows second seasonMr Trump is so polarising that his critics brush off anything that might count as an achievement Shortly before Christmas he signed a useful bipartisan criminaljustice reform into law Some of the regulatory changes to schools and companies have been helpful In foreign affairs the attempt to change the terms of Americas economic relations with China is welcome too But any orthodox Republican president enjoying the backing of both houses of Congress might have achieved as muchor moreWhat marks out Mr Trumps first two years is his irrepressible instinct to act as a wrecker His destructive tactics were supposed to topple a selfserving Washington elite but the presidents bullying lying and sleaze have filled the swamp faster than it has drained Where he has been at his most Trumpishon immigration North Korea NATOthe knocking down has yet to lead to much renewal Mr Trump came to office with a mandate to rewrite Americas immigration rules and make them meritbased as in Canada Yet because he and his staff are hamfisted with Congress that chance is now gone Kim Jong Un still has his weapons programme and having conceded nothing now demands a reward from America Europeans may pay more into their defence budgets at the presidents urging But America has spent half a century and billions of dollars building its relations with Europe In just two years Mr Trump has taken a sledgehammer to themThe next two years could be worse For a start Mr Trumps luck may be about to turn In the first half of his term he has been fortunate He was not faced by any shock of the sort his two predecessors had to deal with 911 Afghanistan Iraq the financial crisis Syria Electoral triumph a roaring economy and surging financial markets gave him an air of invulnerabilityEven without a shock the weather has changed Although the economy is still fairly strong the sugarhigh from the tax cut is fading and growth is slowing in China and Europe Markets which Mr Trump heralds as a proxy for economic success are volatile see article Republicans were trounced in the House in the midterms The new Democratic majority will investigate the presidents conduct and at some point Robert Mueller the special counsel will complete his report on links between Russia and the Trump campaignOver the past two years Mr Trump has shown that he reacts to any adversity by lashing out without regard to the consequences Neither the magnitude nor target of his response need bear on the provocation In the past few weeks he has announced troop withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan Seemingly this was partly because he was being criticised by pundits for failing to build a southern borderwall The Afghanistan withdrawal was later walked back and the Syrian one blurred with the result that nobody can say what Americas policy is though the harm will remain Now that his cabinet has lost its steadying generals expect even more such destructive ambiguityMoreover when Mr Trump acts he does not recognise boundaries legal or ethical He has already been implicated in two felonies and several of his former advisers are in or heading for prison As his troubles mount he will become less bound by institutional machinery If Mr Mueller indicts a member of Mr Trumps family the president may instruct his attorneygeneral to end the whole thing and then make egregious use of his pardon powers House Democrats might unearth documents suggesting that the Trump Organisation was used to launder Russian money What thenConfusion chaos and normbreaking are how Mr Trump operates If the federal government really were a business the turnover of senior jobs in the White House would have investors dumping the stock Mr Trumps interventions often accomplish the opposite of what he intends His criticism of the Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell for being too hawkish will if anything only make an independentminded Fed more hawkish still His own negotiators fear that he might undermine them if the mood takes him Most of the senior staff who have left the administration have said that he is selfabsorbed distracted and illinformed He demands absolute loyalty and when he gets it offers none in returnHow should Congress and the world prepare for what is coming Foreign allies should engage and hedge work with Mr Trump when they can but have a plan B in case he lets them down Democrats in control of the House have a fine line to tread Some are calling for Mr Trump to be impeached but as of now the Republicancontrolled Senate will not convict him As things stand it would be better if the verdict comes at the ballot box Instead they must hold him to account but not play into his desire that they serve as props in his permanent campaignMany Republicans in the Senate find themselves in a now familiar dilemma Speak out and risk losing their seats in a primary stay silent and risk losing their party and their consciences More should follow Mitt Romney who marked his arrival in the Senate this week by criticising Mr Trumps conduct His return to politics is welcome as is the vibrant opposition to Mr Trump by activists and civil society evident in the midterms Assailed by his presidency American democracy is fighting backAfter two chaotic years it is clear that the Trump Show is something to be endured Perhaps the luck will hold and America and the

times since the dark days of the financial crisis turned into the most volatile in a dramatic December It has left pretty much every major asset class in the red for the year although notable exceptions include cash healthcare and utilities stocks as well as German Bunds Depending on whether or not they caught such unpredictable trends on time investors are left with a sense of regret or relief reminiscent of the film Sliding Doors Here are some of the market movements to be rued or relished As the big central banks retreated from easy money policy and in the case of the US Federal Reserve raised overnight borrowing costs every three months so the allure of cash glistened Rising shortterm US interest rates at least to the extent we have seen was not a popular call in January From April it powered a major rally in the dollar Here the pain was twofold for investors holding emerging market bonds and equities Expectations for a weaker dollar in 2018 had negated hedging bullish EM positions When the worlds reserve currency consistently rose in value it left investors scrambling for the exit helping to trigger a rout for EM bonds and shares Many were bearish about US bond yields a trade that did work in stages but as we end December longdated Treasury paper has rallied as the market anticipates a weaker economy that warrants a pause from the Fed next year One important signal has been the behaviour of the 10year Treasury real yield A doubling in its yield to 080 per cent by early February was enough to help spark a dramatic tumble in equities as the popular strategy of selling volatility was unmasked in spectacular style This was a warning that the end of easy money would shift the needle for many asset classes including the thenbooming ranks of cryptocurrencies Growth stocks are vulnerable when yields rise as this lowers the value of future cash flows When the 10year real yield rose above 1 per cent in early October for the first time since 2011 big tech crumbled led by the Faangs Signs that revenue growth could have peaked for some of the groups constituents Amazon and Apple came after they reported quarterly earnings in October and that hardly helped Having enjoyed the status of being valued north of 1tn dollars the two tech giants stumbled badly Such has been the drop in Apple that it is down more than 7 per cent for the calendar year taking its market cap to 740bn Meanwhile Microsoft buoyed by its cloud prowess stands 18 per cent higher for 2018 and is worth 777bn Even within a tech rout that was some rotation trade between these two companies which have defined the computing age since the 1970sAnother warning sign for US tech occurred during the summer Chinas giants Baidu and Alibaba turned lower in July after fellow sector heavyweight Tencent started sliding from April As wider Chinese equities also headed south the pressure on EM was highlighted and there was a deterioration in the performance of European and UK bluechips After hopes had flickered anew in January that 2018 was the year to gain from owning European and Japanese shares a slowing China was a warning for regions dependent on global trade and one flagged via the proxy of industrial metals After peaking in April an index of copper aluminium nickel and zinc had fallen 20 per cent by August and this index would make new lows in November That resonated with global miners and helped drag the FTSE 100 from its peak in May and in spite of a weaker pound As the trade war heated up so European equities were burnt already under pressure from Italy electing a populist coalition government in AprilThe faltering performance of metals reflecting slowing demand from China and EM economies was ignored by the oil market As the US sought to impose sanctions on Iran and shale gas and oil production surged the market entered October targeting 100abarrel oil In the space of just seven weeks Brent crude plunged by a third from a peak of 86 a barrel to about 53 Slowing global demand as signified by metals prices since April finally registered in the oil marketPlaying a major role in equity weakness was financials banks and asset managers and this told us how the retreat from the era of easy money resonated with a group that had prospered when investors sought yield and paid minimal attention to risk particularly in risky areas of creditAs the tide of central bank bond purchases turned one refuge among equities was somewhat appropriate given the bruising performance the healthcare sector Growth from new drugs and devices came in tandem with its established defensive qualities including the protection of patents Other winners included the big exchanges benefiting from higher volatility and market rotations Here Chicagos CME Group was a standout As we end a punishing year investors can at least park their money in a Treasury bill that pays 24 per cent A yield like that has not been seen since January 2008 and is more than the SampP 500s average dividend yield while also being higher than that of a global bond index When cash is an attractive home little wonder December has been the worse month all year for equities as

assets,https://www.ft.com/content/ec95b738-01f6-11e9-99df-6183d3002ee1,2018-12-17 15:15:43,The recent dip of the US fiveyear Treasury yield below the twoyear rate has reignited fears of an overall curve inversion which is usually seen as a precursor for an economic downturn But while according to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco every US recession in the past 60 years was preceded by a negative term spread the actual timing is much harder to predict Historical evidence suggests it can take anywhere between six months and two years from when long Treasury yields drop below shortterm interest rates for GDP growth to turn negative Our research of central banks rateraising cycles showed that share prices can even continue to rise for another year as they did for instance after the US curve inversion in 2006 It then took a further six months before the recession set in Yet even as the overall stock market pursues its upward trajectory defensive sectors can already start to outperform their cyclical counterparts although this pattern has been more apparent in Europe than on the other side of the Atlantic A more consistent picture could be observed for corporate bond risk premia Irrespective of the region and time period credit spreads started to widen once longterm sovereign yields began their descent This was also one of the most persistent correlation patterns we have witnessed throughout the recent Fed cycle which began shortly after the US presidential election in 2016 Another regular motif was an inverse relationship between share prices and corporate yield premia with the latter tightening as the former rose and vice versa However as equity values continue to climb while government bonds profit from lower yields during the later part of the raising cycle the negative interaction of rates and spreads appears to prevail Since the Fed and the Bank of England have started to raise rates again we have frequently noted a positive impact on their respective currencies This happened not only at the actual rate rise date but in anticipation of the move for example when a strongerthanexpected inflation release fuelled expectations of a more aggressive monetary policy response The British pound in particular appeared to have frequently profited from higher shortterm rates in past raising cycles although more recent exchangerate movements have been largely driven by the perceived progress of the Brexit negotiations The relationship between interest and exchange rates was less clearcut for the euro and US dollar As the worlds two biggest reserve currencies their values are driven by a multitude of factors in addition to the interest rate differential For example the greenback regularly depreciated against its major rivals euro and yen in particular in times of rising geopolitical uncertainty such as a deterioration in the relationships with China or Russia Conversely the euro dropped against the dollar whenever the political situation worsened in Italy Germany or France The euro has the additional particularity that it is shared by 19 countries While issues relating to the UK are usually directly reflected in the value of the pound the customary release valve for eurozone member states is the sovereign yield spread over German Bunds The intensity of the reaction will further depend on the perceived safety and creditworthiness of the issuer For example the Italian BTPBund spread surged 150 basis points after the formation of the populist government in May 2018 In contrast the risk premium on French 10year OATs has gained only 8bp since the start of the gilets jaunes protests on November 17 In general contagion across issuers within the currency bloc has been fairly limited A stress test we performed on a significant further expansion of Italian yield spreads resulted in only moderate losses for other peripheral issuers As of yet traders still seem to distinguish between countries with high debttoGDP ratios such as Italy 132 per cent Portugal 123 per cent and Greece 180 per cent and those with levels below 100 per cent such as Spain 97 per cent But there is an increased risk of wider sovereign spreads once the European Central Bank removes support for European bond markets by terminating its assetpurchasing programme in January 2019 The BoEs next steps will much depend on how and if Britain will leave the EU Monetary Policy Committee members have already hinted that rates may rise faster than currently expected in the case of a favourable Brexit deal and an orderly transition period In a hard Brexit scenario on the other hand it seems unlikely the Bank would actually tighten monetary conditions especially in light of its emergency cut following the

few weeks multiple street protests police firing tear gas and anger over new laws that threaten to make life harder for many This time though the venue is Budapest not Paris and the target is not smooth liberal standardbearer Emmanuel Macron but rugged rightwing nativist Viktor Orban The demonstrations against the Hungarian prime minister are a reminder that there is another side to the narrative of nationalisms relentless rise in the EU The antiOrban rallies like similar protests seen previously in near neighbours such as Romania and Poland reveal plenty of people still resist the traditionalist autocratic style even as it prospers in central Europe and elsewhere On Monday several opposition MPs were assaulted or manhandled as they protested for a free media inside Hungarys public broadcaster  AP But the Budapest streets kaleidoscope of flares and prodemocracy banners are ominous as well as heartening for Brussels They show that the Orban government emboldened by a big reelection win fewer than nine months ago is undeterred by EU disciplinary proceedings launched against it in September and is if anything more brazen than before Consider the events that triggered the demonstrations In a chaotic preChristmas Hungarian parliament sitting last Wednesday MPs pushed through legislation to tighten government control of the judiciary and increase the overtime hours companies can ask employees to work what critics brand the slavery law That the vote came on the eve of a European summit in Brussels seemed to hold no fear for Mr Orbans ruling Fidesz party Sure enough Budapest attracted little criticism at an EU leaders gathering dominated by the Brexit crisis save for an oblique swipe by JeanClaude Juncker European Commission president who railed at the Hungarian premier as an origin of fake news about the impact of migration The immediate summit aftermath has also given Mr Orban little to worry about The commission on Monday said it shared the extensive concerns about Hungary outlined in a European Parliamentendorsed report this year notably on fundamental rights corruption the treatment of the Roma people and the independence of the judiciary But Brussels also made clear that it was up to EU member states to deal with the problem The chances of that seem slim while both Hungary and Poland are the subject of Article 7 inquiries for alleged breaches of EU values each has vowed to thwart the unanimity required among the other 27 countries to impose sanctions such as suspending voting rights The commissions alternative strategy of nipping at Hungarys heels through European Court of Justice challenges to contentious new laws has similarly proved inadequate in containing Orban This is perhaps the most important difference between events in Paris and Budapest While the gilets jaunes protest movement soon forced Mr Macron into concessions the Orban government has so far shrugged off the protests and pressed on with a radical agenda that is already reshaping the EU Chart du jour Britains migration switch Britains vote to leave the EU started a Brexodus Last month the ONS reported that for the first time in nearly a

for the year ahead,https://www.ft.com/content/c971bfb9-a418-33eb-9247-4b02e8815a7d,2018-12-17 04:00:05,FTfm canvassed the investment chiefs at 10 of the worlds largest asset managers overseeing a combined 21tn for their 2019 predictions The executives said market volatility Brexit and trade tension will continue to be big themes in the new year They also warned of higher levels of corporate debt and tightening liquidity as risks to the global economy Pascal Blanqu CIO Amundi Asset Management What should investors expect in the year ahead Lower returns following the removal of central bank stimulus will persist But compared with 2017 valuations are less stretched and even appealing in some markets due to this years price dislocations and interest rates that are expected to remain low The macro setting remains one of latecycle with a mild deceleration in the global economy Central banks could be more dovish than currently discounted Politics will continue to be a source of volatility Investors should adopt a selective approach identifying opportunities in the markets where political risk and the tighter liquidity are already factored in This will be the year for active investors and for alpha creation Biggest risk Corporate debt especially in the US which will become a challenge if refinancing conditions deteriorate and growth slows Tighter global liquidity also represents a risk Favour quality and value avoid crowded trades and focus on liquidity management Biggest opportunity The more appealing valuations and the fact that most bond yield repricing is behind us would call for increased risktaking in some selected areas of the market Stronger earnings will support a recovery in equities with the US equity market key There are areas to benefit from this years price dislocations One is Europe once the political risk linked to next Mays parliamentary elections diminishes Another is emerging markets helped by the end of US Federal Reserve tightening and some local monetary and fiscal stabilisation policies Quirkiest prediction After the recent repricing emerging markets could come back in investors favour Growth differentials could accelerate again in favour of emerging markets compared to developed markets in the second half of 2019 and moving to 2020 A relaxation of ChinaUS tension could support inflows we see opportunities in EM bonds but are staying away from the most fragile and unbalanced economies Where will the SampP 500 be at yearend If trade tension intensifies the market could be barely positive If as we believe trade tension eases at least until the next presidential campaign and the Fed slows the pace of tightening we could see positive performance of the market in line with earnings per share growth of 8 per cent Richard Turnill global chief investment strategist BlackRock What should investors expect We see potential for positive returns from global equities and bonds in 2019 as we enter a latecycle slowdown and cheaper valuations lower the bar for positive performance Yet returns are likely to be muted as robust growth and corporate earnings slow and rising risks loom over markets We see trade risks more fully reflected in asset prices than a year ago but twists and turns are likely to cause bouts of anxiety The Federal Reserves policy is set to become more datadependent as it nears a neutral stance and we expect a pause in rate increases early in 2019 as the economy slows Biggest risk USChina trade friction could take a turn for the worse and cause a rise in fears of a global slowdown Markets are vulnerable to these concerns even as we see low recession risk in 2019 Biggest opportunity We prefer stocks over bonds but with less conviction We advocate a barbell approach government debt as ballast coupled with targeted risktaking We favour quality US and emerging market equities Quirkiest prediction We predict that 2019 will mark the first significant launch of driverless taxis for public use We are seeing client interest in thematic investing soar tech disruption is one example SampP 500 at yearend Within equities the US remains a favoured region Valuations are high but we find prospects for earnings growth stronger than in other regions Stefan Kreuzkamp CIO DWS What should investors expect Plenty of volatility Trade Brexit and Italy all look set to continue generating unnerving headlines So might the runup to European Parliament elections in May On the plus side economic fundamentals continue to look strong especially in the US But neither markets nor central banks have had much experience with quantitative tightening This increases the scope for policy errors or simply market perceptions that policy errors could be in the offing Biggest risk Tough call but probably trade Brexit and Italys budgethaggling with the EU are big risks for these countries and for broader eurozone growth Monetary policy errors are always a risk But the further erosion or potential dismantling of the worlds rulebased global trading order and with it international supply chains is a risk of a different order of magnitude to corporate earnings investment and productivity growth This could drag down growth for the world as a whole for many years to come hurting equity valuations in a sustained way as soon as markets begin to price in an end to globalisation Biggest opportunity That 2019 proves just another boring year in which nothing much changes in terms of global economic fundamentals and the business cycle continues to withstand all potential drags from politics Quirkiest prediction We are German We dont do quirky predictions Joking aside we wouldnt be surprised to see an unexpected resurgence of mainstream broadly centrist and proEuropean parties in elections to the European Parliament Low turnout and asymmetric voter mobilisation might for once favour broadly proEU forces Of course a lot can still happen before elections on May 2326 SampP 500 at yearend 2950 James Elliot CIO for multiasset solutions JPMorgan Asset Management What should investors expect Latecycle dynamics to continue to play out with USled global growth and further US monetary tightening This may cause further volatility as investors question whether rate hikes could bring an end to the late cycle and consider how much further US corporate earnings can go Meanwhile we are starting to see the economic impact of trade actions and no immediate resolution which adds further uncertainty to the corporate earnings outlook for markets outside the US Biggest risk A continuation of the current downdraught in global growth data and US growth outperformance fading in addition to an escalation in trade tension both would add to a creeping sense that US corporate earnings have reached a cyclical peak Biggest opportunity In a more volatile environment with tightening liquidity we can take advantage of market dislocations and invest over different time horizons Investing in longterm opportunities such as focusing on growth exposure driven by secular trends such as adoption of technology can reduce exposure to the business cycle Quirkiest prediction Continued slowing in Europe politics and global headwinds will prevent the European Central Bank from raising rates before the next downturn SampP 500 at yearend Lower than it is now Kristina Hooper chief global market strategist Invesco What should investors expect A wild and bumpy ride There are a variety of forces at work buffeting markets from the unwinding of experimental monetary policy to growing geopolitical risks As monetary policy normalises markets will normalise which means higher volatility and lower correlations among securities Geopolitical risk is rising causing policy uncertainty and contributing to volatility We expect to see currency fluctuations as a result of economic and central bank divergence In this environment there are likely to be rotations in leadership among sectors regions market capitalisations and even factors Biggest risk Protectionism monetary policy normalisation and high debt levels Any one of these is significant but together they represent a perfect storm with the potential to negatively affect economic growth and roil markets Biggest opportunity Technology stocks have been oversold for a variety of reasons but fundamentals remain strong We are in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution that should be transformative for many industries and I expect an increasing percentage of every capex dollar to be spent on technology Quirkiest prediction The US loses the trade war China is playing chess while the US is playing checkers Unlike the US China has the ability to play a long game and the US does not When cracks appear in the US economic picture I expect the US to capitulate SampP 500 at yearend 28752975 Anton Eser CIO Legal amp General Investment Management What should investors expect Twelve months ago I said we should brace for a 30 per cent equity market correction as central banks withdraw liquidity We havent quite seen a move of this magnitude but the signs of constrained liquidity across multiple markets and regions make me increasingly worried for the coming months Unlike the banking crisis of 200708 this downturn may be driven by overlevered corporates unprepared for slowing economic growth and sweeping technological change Be wary of catching a falling knife valuations are cheapening but we should wait for governments to support the corporate sector before relying on a sustained recovery Biggest risk As global monetary policy tightens overlevered corporates are going to face increasingly tough financing conditions The biggest risk is that we see a funding crunch with large corporates getting into real difficulty as ratings slide down the scale and heavily exposed investors are forced to exit Biggest opportunity Unencumbered liquidity has already reduced in recent months and is likely to deteriorate further alongside quantitative tightening If you can maintain liquidity when all around you are losing theirs then there will be opportunities to pick up good assets at attractive valuations You need to plan now Quirkiest prediction US longdated Treasury yields may well end 2019 lower then they began it and could turn out to be the best asset class to own SampP 500 at yearend Probably lower and much lower if market volatility implies a growing risk of global recession Andrew Balls global CIO for fixed income Pimco What should investors expect The global economy has entered the later stage of the economic expansion We are past the peak in the cycle central bank support continues to be unwound and political risk continues to loom large across countries We place something like a 30 per cent probability of a US recession over the next 12 months higher than at any point in this nineyear expansion While we dont expect that a recession is round the corner we see US growth synching lower with the rest of the world as tighter financial conditions start to bite and fiscal stimulus fades We believe that tighter financial conditions and political risks across the globe such as the rise in populism and conflict between the US and China will continue to be a source of uncertainty and increased volatility In response investors should create portfolios that are resilient and more defensive Biggest risk We are concerned about corporate credit markets as a crowded position and we are focused on downside risks and credit market structureliquidity in the event of a rotation out of credit We think therefore it makes sense for us to be very cautious in terms of our overall corporate credit exposure and see nonagency mortgages as offering a defensive alternative Overall we prefer higher quality and higher liquidity positions and a small number of high conviction special opportunities rather than a broad spread of generic corporate credit Biggest opportunity We expect to find good opportunities where we see real cheapness in a more volatile environment As an example we continue to like housingrelated securities in the US and Europe valuations still look reasonable and we dont see the sort of household excess or excessive lending we saw before the financial crisis similarly we expect supply demand dynamics to remain balanced Quirkiest prediction In spite of the continued uncertainty around Brexit we see UK financials as offering very attractive relative value We see a very low probability of a chaotic nodeal Brexit Even if that tailrisk case is realised while UK financials would likely underperform in the short term the capital positions of the UK banks look robust and we think they would continue to be a reasonable investment SampP 500 at yearend Even though we expect US growth to converge lower towards the rest of the world we expect US equities to outperform as companies are more profitable and the market is less cyclical Akiyoshi Nagashima CIO Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management What should investors expect Although the US economy is in good shape its annual growth rate in gross domestic product may slow down from above 3 per cent to 25 per cent in 2019 This does not necessarily mean that the US economy will enter a recession Therefore the SampP 500 could exceed the historical high of 2930 points As for the Japanese economy it has been steadily growing and will continue to grow towards the Tokyo Olympics in 2020 The enthronement of the new emperor will keep the Japanese positive enough to beat the negative impact of the consumption tax hike scheduled in 2019 The Nikkei 225 will surpass the recent historical high level of 24500 Biggest risk Escalation of the USChina trade war is the key risk for the US and Chinese economies as well as global markets However both President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping understand that titfortat actions hurt their economies and this seems to be reflected in their latest move to agree a truce in their trade dispute although previous tariffs remain in place Biggest opportunity On the other side of the coin the biggest opportunity could be the potential deescalation of tension between the US and China This will improve market sentiment and will undoubtedly be an opportunity for investors Quirkiest prediction In a preventive manner the Fed may start easing before the US economy enters a recession Fed chairman Jay Powell is smart enough to take appropriate action based on his datadriven approach SampP 500 at yearend It may clear the historical high of 2930 With the US economy stable there is no reason to believe that the SampP 500 wont hit a new record unless the economy nosedives and enters into recession next year Suni Harford head of investments UBS Asset Management What should investors expect Solid global growth for at least the first half of 2019 and a partial resynchronisation of global growth drivers as US demand moderates and as Chinas measures to cushion growth kick in Investors should also expect a gradual shift higher in developedworld inflation and government bond yields as output gaps close and wage growth accelerates Against this backdrop and with stronger valuation support after the sharp recent derating we remain positive on global equities But with monetary policy conditions slowly tightening continued geopolitical risks and uncertain macroeconomic outcomes as the cycle matures we expect high market volatility to continue Biggest risk The imbalances in the global economy have been a key driver of market volatility in 2018 Major demand drivers will at least partly resynchronise in 2019 but if growth outside the US fails to stabilise as we expect the US is unlikely to be able to support abovetrend growth in the global economy as it has done in 2018 as its fiscal stimulus begins to fade Any subsequent dollar strength would further tighten financial conditions in the US and probably prompt another round of pressure on weaker emerging markets Biggest opportunity Higher volatility means plenty of opportunity for skilled stock pickers From an asset allocation perspective emerging markets appear attractively valued in a longterm context after struggling in 2018 The road ahead is likely to be bumpy but on a selective basis valuations feel out of kilter with fundamentals Quirkiest prediction Not supplied SampP 500 at yearend 2800 Peter Westaway chief economist Europe Vanguard What should investors expect A slowdown in global growth but probably not a recession and subdued returns across all asset classes with elevated risks of a sharp downturn Biggest risk A sharp downturn in the US as the business cycle matures exacerbated by fading policy stimulus and aggravated by trade wars Biggest opportunity For investors to ignore the risks about market downturns and to stay invested Putting money in cash with the temptation to stay out of the market until the risks have passed is a definite recipe for low returns Quirkiest prediction Brexit doesnt happen SampP 500 at yearend Where it is today

D.C. attorney general's office.,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/19/dc-attorney-general-will-sue-facebook-over-cambridge-analytica.html,2018-12-19 17:19:00,The Washington DC attorney general said Wednesday it will sue Facebook over the Cambridge Analytica scandal The story was first reported in the Washington Post Facebooks confusing privacy permissions as one reason for the action as well as other deceptive privacy practices meant to override consumer privacy choices Racine added during a Wednesday conference call Attorney General Karl A Racine today sued Facebook Inc for failing to protect its users data enabling abuses like one that exposed nearly half of all District residents data to manipulation for political purposes during the 2016 election In its lawsuit the Office of the Attorney General OAG alleges Facebooks lax oversight and misleading privacy settings allowed among other things a thirdparty application to use the platform to harvest the personal information of millions of users without their permission and then sell it to a political consulting firm In the runup to the 2016 presidential election some Facebook users downloaded a personality quiz app which also collected data from the app users Facebook friends without their knowledge or consent The apps developer then sold this data to Cambridge Analytica which used it to help presidential campaigns target voters based on their personal traits Facebook took more than two years to disclose this to its consumers OAG is seeking monetary and injunctive relief including relief for harmed consumers damages and penalties to the DistrictFacebook failed to protect the privacy of its users and deceived them about who had access to their data and how it was usedsaid AG Racine Facebook put users at risk of manipulation by allowing companies like Cambridge Analytica and other thirdparty applications to collect personal data without users permission Todays lawsuit is about making Facebook live up to its promise to protect its users privacyFacebook Inc headquartered in Menlo Park California is a digital social networking service with more than 2 billion active users around the world Through a website and a mobile application Facebook allows users to communicate and share content with personalized networks of friendsAs part of its business model Facebook collects data that touches on every aspect of users personal lives This includes information provided by the user name gender birthdate email address hometown interests education political affiliation photos messages etc and information about users digital behavior their friends likes shares clicks on the site and more Facebook offers social networking services for free and uses the personal data it collects to sell targeted advertising to marketers It also allows thirdparty developers to build applications that operate on the Facebook platform and offer services including calendar and email integration games and quizzesIn 2013 Facebook allowed Aleksandr Kogan a researcher affiliated with Englands Cambridge University and his company Global Science Research GSR to launch an app on the Facebook platform called thisisyourdigitallife The app claimed to be a personality quiz and offered to generate a personality profile in exchange for users downloading the app and granting it access to their Facebook data Although only 852 Facebook users in the District installed Kogans app it also collected the personal information of those users Facebook friendsamounting to nearly half of all District residents GSR then sold that information to Cambridge Analytica a political consulting firmAn investigation by OAG found that this abuse was among the many examples of Facebooks failure to protect consumers data adequately The investigation found that Facebook violated the Districts Consumer Protection Procedures Act CPPA which prohibits unfair and deceptive trade practices Among the ways that Facebook harmed consumers the complaint alleges areMisleading users about the security of their data Facebook represented to users that it would protect the privacy of their personal information and that it required applications and thirdparty developers to respect consumers privacy However Facebook allowed Kogan to collect and sell the data of users who had not downloaded or used Kogans appFailing to properly monitor thirdparty apps use of data Although Facebook was aware as early as 2014 that Kogan wanted to download the personal information not only of his apps users but also of his users friends Facebook failed to monitor or audit the app to see if it was abiding by Facebooks policies for thirdparty applications and user dataMaking it difficult for users to control data settings for apps Facebook maintained confusing and ambiguous privacy and applications settings that made it difficult for consumers to control how their data was shared Instead of allowing users to control access to their information on thirdparty apps directly from its main privacy settings page Facebook required users to go to a different part of its platform for thirdparty app privacy settings This made it harder for consumers to realize that apps could be harvesting their dataFailing to disclose the Cambridge Analytica breach to consumers for more than two years Facebook first became aware in 2015 that Cambridge Analytica had obtained millions of users data The company conducted a cursory investigation and confirmed that the data had been improperly harvested from users and then sold to Cambridge Analytica However Facebook did not inform users affected by the breach until 2018Failing to ensure users improperly obtained data was deleted Even after it confirmed its users data had been improperly harvested Facebook took Cambridge Analytica at its word that the company had deleted the data They did this even though Facebook staffers were embedded with the Trump campaign and other campaigns working alongside Cambridge Analytica staff to use the data to target votersFailing to inform consumers that some companies could override data privacy settings Facebook also failed to inform consumers that it granted certain companies many of whom were mobile device makers special permissions that enabled those companies to access consumer data and override consumer privacy settingsOAG is seeking an injunction to ensure Facebook puts in place protocols and safeguards to monitor users data and to make it easier for users to control their privacy settings In addition OAG is seeking restitution for consumers penalties and costsThis story is developing check back for more details

15yearold who lives in Selinsgrove Pa has Christmas advice Take your grandchild out to eatshe likes Applebees for grilled chicken wonton tacosand then shopping at a favorite store which for her used to be Claires for jewelry and is now Aeropostale to pick out something that fits and wont have to be returned Do it oneonone not with siblings and parents so you have time togetherIts the perfect gift she says and a tradition she and her grandmother Candace Belles began after Izzy outgrew dolls Mrs Belles 68 who does the same with Izzys 12yearold sister still buys small gifts for under the tree I like to have a little something they can open she saysGrandparents are generous when it comes to presents Their spending on toys increased at a faster rate than that of parents over the last 12 months according to a 2018 report from the NPD Group a consumer analytics firm Gifts are the top category of spending by grandparents according to an AARP survey to be released next year On average grandparents in Oklahoma shelled out the most339 per grandchildon holiday gifts with Connecticut and Washington DC coming in second and third according to online lender OppLoans which surveyed 1700 grandparents in 50 states With all those grandparents doing all that giving it can be hard to draw the line on how much is too much and what to give And as children get older and tastes veer toward virtual gifts like music and games its more challenging to suggest something that can be wrapped Kelly Hughes is a Pittsburgh mother of four children ages 6 to 9 who have two sets of grandparents and two great grandparents She sends them wish lists from the children with things that can be bought on Amazon which she thinks is better than a surprise You cant force a child to play with something just because you like it says the 38yearold who runs a nonprofit for children in foster care I think its a waste One grandparent didnt approve of Xbox and didnt buy a gift on the wish list related to the game Thats fine Ms Hughes says She does caution grandparents to be careful when posting photos of what they gave to other grandchildren because kids might wonder why a cousin got a nicer

etiquette consultant and columnist for the Telegraph Journal in New Brunswick Canada At one time he was asked advice about inlaws who bought children too many gifts The reader wondered if it would be appropriate to suggest money for a college fund instead His advice Show gratitude set boundaries and skip the college fund which is a nice idea but not warm and fuzzyThe key is flexibility he says which is hard with holidays wrapped in tradition People feel like they have to live up to a standard Mr Remer says Although some grandparents think cash is impersonal he thinks its fine especially for a grandchild who wants to save moneyIn this culture where there are so many kids who have so much the question of additional presents is a tricky one says Jane Isay grandmother of four and author of Unconditional Love A Guide to Navigating the Joys and Challenges of Being a Grandparent Today Consult the parents first she says to see what is wanted needed or allowed Its a sign of respect and hopefully avoids returns Dont try to compete with other grandparents She doesnt know what the kids get from their other grandparents I get a little curious and then my better self says Jane give it up she says Her four grandchildren make wish lists for Hanukkah A grandson wanted a gift card from a clothing site A granddaughter wanted sunglasses Another wanted a walkietalkie from Amazon and the fourth books about Paris and London for an upcoming trip Everyone was happy she says Amy Hambrick of Raleigh NC says her boys 11 and 13 like virtual gifts like online music purchases and Vbucks for Fortnite I even took them toTargetand a toy shop to see what they liked says Ms Hambrick who had the boys come up with wish lists that she forwarded to grandparents including her father Bill Beckman

discuss their difficulties in finding jobs and staying employed They were joined that November Saturday by Ranga Jayaraman a former chief information officer at Stanfords Graduate School of Business They strategized how to help each other get jobs in the tech industry and Mr Jayaraman offered to introduce them to his contacts Heres the twist This was a local meeting of adults with autism as well as family members and advocates Our group known as Aascendan acronym for Autism Asperger Spectrum Coalition for Education Networking and Developmentis one of several autism mutualsupport groups that have arisen across the US Ive been part of Aascend since 2011 as a family member of an adult with autism We consider ourselves part of the long tradition of American voluntary associations celebrated by Alexis de Tocqueville in the 1830s and by many social scientists since Only now in 21stcentury America the autism associations Tocquevillian culture of mutual support makes them stand outAascends main focus for the past few years has been on employment Though data are scarce the largest recent study of autism employment from Drexel University in 2017 found that only 14 of adults with autism and using government disability services held a paying job The estimates have changed little in the past three decades despite the numerous government departments and initiatives serving workers with disabilitiesAascend members help each other advance Last week an email arrived from a parent with a son on the autism spectrum Although the son has a college degree in computer science he hasnt been able to find a job I forwarded the email to Mr Jayaraman who agreed to help with job leads Brian Jacobs a prominent venture capitalist has used his tech network to identify opportunities as has Dan Simpson at Cruise Automation Three of our members are working now at the software company SAP with others at AmazonAppleand in local government Aascend has also met withSalesforceAirbnb Pinterest and LinkedInall local employers with budding autismtargeted initiativesNationally there are autism employment volunteers doing a lot more In Atlanta Chet Hurwitz a former PwC partner and his wife Sara Barron have founded Ventures ATL to create small businesses specifically to employ adults with autism These companies mostly specialize in data entry and product fulfillment In New York Drew Schaffran a Morgan Lewis partner soon will leave law to work fulltime on Extraordinary Ventures NY which operates small candlemaking jewelry and laundry businesses Spectrum Designs Chocolate Spectrum and Smile Biscotti are other autismemploymentfocused ventures powered by family members not governmentTheres plenty to doand not only with employment Aascend members help each other with housing and have created an arts collective Our young people have formed their own social network and go to movies and sports events together We even have a show on local television and social media Life on the Autism Spectrum with a cast and crew of people with autism Someone outside our community might look at these efforts and shake his head at the modest results I wouldnt disagree Convincing employers to overcome their preconceptions and hire people on the autism spectrum is a big challenge Hopefully that will change but for now it is Aascends culture that turns heads There are four lessons for better civic life that everyone with or without autism can learn from itFirst in my nearly 30 years of work in the autism world I have never heard our adults on the spectrum or family members describe themselves as victims You can imagine the challenges they face especially those with limited language or other cognitive skills Yet they dont consider themselves socially oppressed or whine about perceived slights They are stronger than thatSecond there is none of the racial categorizing that exists elsewhere Autism affects all races and ethnic groups and our membership reflects that Race is rarely mentioned we are united by deeper bonds and more pressing needsThird Aascend members with autism are regarded as active agents involved in all activities and decisionmaking rather than passive dependents Our members use government employment counseling and housing services but mainly to avoid longterm dependence on government benefitsFourth we focus on tangible gains not ideology Republican or Democrat nobody cares Our common practical ventures overwhelm the animosities swirling elsewhere In fact after his recent Aascend talk Mr Jayaraman reached out to join us attracted by the absence

withdraw US troops from east Syria transferring the region to Turkish military control goes beyond the wildest expectations of Turkeys President Recep Tayyip ErdoganFor Mr Erdogan this may also turn into an example of the need to be careful what you wish forTurkey which was angling to seize from USbacked Syrian Kurdish forces a much more modest swath of land along its southern frontier could now become the pivotal power in Syria establishing a protectorate over a vast and oilrich territoryAlready Mr Erdogan is seeing his ambitions for regional leadership validated by the White House as Turkey turns from the target of frequent American criticism and even economic sanctions to an indispensable partner in Syria and beyond Mr Trump even accepted an invitation from Mr Erdogan to visit Turkey in 2019It will be a gamechanger for the region if the US and Turkey were to start working as partners with each other said Hassan Hassan a Syria specialist at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy in Washington If the US wants to do something about Iran it needs a partner in the Middle Eastand this partner is Turkey not Saudi ArabiaTurkey with NATOs secondlargest army and sophisticated diplomatic and intelligence services certainly has more ability to project power than Mr Trumps initial ally of choice in the Middle East Saudi Arabia Thats especially so after the Saudi monarchys image in Washington and the region was stained by the kingdoms assassination of dissident writer Jamal Khashoggi the affair that could still spur Congressional punishment of RiyadhYet the Syria expansion also takes Turkey into a period of new and to a large extent unpredictable risks just as its economy starts to emerge from a currency crisis earlier this year In addition to confronting the Kurds Turkey will also likely have to contend with Syrias Sunni Arab areas where sympathies for Islamic State extremists still lingerIf the US is fully withdrawing and Turkey is asked to take over all these areas it will be too much Even the US could not do it all by itselfthere will need to be local forces supporting the Turkish military and other actors will have to be standing by Turkey said independent Turkish lawmaker Ozturk Yilmaz the countrys former consulgeneral in Mosul who was held hostage by Islamic State in 2014In fact Turkey may end up cutting a deal with Russia and the Syrian regime to take over only part of the territory that the US will vacateand leaving alone the most troublesome zones such as Raqqa and lands further south Mr Erdogan said Tuesday he will soon be meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss how to confront the consequences of Mr Trumps decisionIt is certainly more than the Turkish side had hoped for said Ahmet Kasim Han a professor at Altinbas University in Istanbul But it still remains a Turkish prerogative how deep its operation should go and how long forMr Trump for his part has tweeted that Mr Erdogan promised him to eradicate whatever is left of Islamic State in Syriaan expectation that Turkey rather that Iran or Russia would be responsible for eliminating the militant groups remnantsThere are many potential pitfalls that could scuttle Turkeys Syria ambitions and undermine the unfolding realignment of Americas Middle East policy The biggest unknown is what the YPG Syrian Kurdish forces who currently control eastern Syriaand who would prefer virtually anyone but the Turks to replace American troopswill do in coming weeks Turkey views YPG as an existential foe because it is affiliated with the PKK or Kurdistan Workers Partya movement that has waged a secessionist war in eastern Turkey for decades and that is classified as terrorist by Ankara and Washington alike Mr Erdogan has been sending more troops and tanks to its border with Syria along Kurdishheld areas in recent daysThe American withdrawal doesnt automatically open the path to a Turkish invasion into Syrias Kurdish enclave cautioned Ertugrul Kurkcu a former Turkish lawmaker and honorary chairman of HDP the proKurdish party in Turkeys parliament Following Mr Trumps decision Russia Iran and the Syrian regime have become the new interlocutors for the Kurds to negotiate their and Syrias future he said as the Kurds seek to protect their political and social gains in the east of EuphratesUS troops have forged close bonds with these Kurdish fighters in the common fight against Islamic State since 2014 and have come to view YPG fighters as allies and comradesinarms That was one reason why Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the presidential envoy on fighting Islamic State Brett McGurk resigned in protest against Mr Trumps pullout decision The flip side of that shift is a dramatic improvement in Americas ties with TurkeyThe US withdrawal is eliminating the most egregious irritant in bilateral relationsUS support for YPG said SinanUlgen a former Turkish diplomat and head of the Edam think tank in Istanbul This will vastly improve relations and defuse the prevailing antiAmerican rhetoric in TurkeyIn another perhaps unintended consequence the planned withdrawal could also torpedo Turkeys rapprochement with Russia and Iran that began in part as Ankaras response to the cold shoulder it was receiving from the Obama administration and until recently Mr TrumpTurkeys cooperation with Iran and Russia is a matter of convenience

country is the worlds biggest untapped tech market Just 24 of Indians own smartphones and the number of users is growing faster than in any other country according to research firm eMarketerHow has that worked out for one of Americas most valuable companiesThe number of iPhones shipped in India has fallen 40 so far this year compared with 2017 and Apples market share there has dropped to about 1 from about 2 research firm Canalys estimates The Cupertino Calif company posted revenues of 18 billion in India this fiscal year That is less than half of what executives had once hoped to capture said a person familiar with its targetsIts been a rout said Ishan Dutt an analyst at CanalysChief Executive Tim Cook has gone from touting Indias potential to seldom mentioning it now He has said he remains bullish about the companys longterm prospects despite challenges including a weak currency I sort of view these as speed bumps along a very long journey he told analysts last month The long term is I think is very very strongAn Apple spokeswoman asked to comment referred to Mr Cooks previous remarksAt the heart of the issue is Apples reluctance to change its traditional business model for selling the iPhone Rather than make a range of handsets it has prioritized a limited number of coveted products sold at high pricesa strategy that revived the company after near bankruptcy in 1997 and helped make it the first US public company to reach a 1 trillion valuation The iPhones margins have been the basis for threequarters of the companys gross profit in recent years analysts sayIndias

targeted the device at wealthy Indians through highend retail stores and later broadened its reach to the middle class through monthly payment plans people familiar with the business said As the iPhone became one of the most popular smartphones in the world Apples annual sales in India rose to more than 1 billion by 2015 from about 100 million in 2011 these people saidThat caught the attention of Mr Cook and Cupertino executives They wanted to make India the companys next growth market and created a fiveyear plan to increase Apples sales to 5 billion by 2020 according to those peopleMr Cook traveled to India in 2016 to meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and pose for photos with Bollywood stars He visited iPhone retailers and a Hindu temple donning a traditional scarf and a type of orange mark on his forehead that is typically applied for auspicious purposesOne factor holding Apple back in India Mr Cook said was the lack of highspeed 4G connectivity which made viewing content such as video less compelling on iPhonesIn a town hall meeting with Apple staff during his India visit Mr Cook said India is different and we need to treat it differently according to a person familiar with the matterApple tapped Sanjay Kaul to lead that effort promoting him to country manager from head of the iPhone business in India Mr Kaul who joined Apple in 2011 from Research In Motion Ltd maker of BlackBerry devices knew how to navigate Indias unique sales market where manufacturers funnel devices through distributors to momandpop stores that sell some twothirds of all handsets Mr Kaul declined to commentTo deliver on Cupertinos ambitious sales targets he increased Apples network of distributors and sought to expand the iPhones reach from the nations biggest cities such as New Delhi and Mumbai to smaller growing metropolises said the people familiar with the matterThe company coupled that push with steep discounts on iPhones to juice sales the people said Yet even Apples least expensive new devices were out of reach of all but the wealthiest Indians Distributors wound up holding excess inventory they couldnt sellMeanwhile competitors like Chinas OnePlusXiaomi Corpsometimes called the Apple of Chinaand BBK Electronics Corps Oppo and Vivo flooded India with smartphones many of which cost less than 200 Some signed on Bollywood and cricket stars among Indias biggest celebrities to promote their productsUnlike Apple which typically spurns market research competitors have conducted extensive ontheground research in India into local consumer habits quickly incorporating functionality like special cameras for taking better selfies Market research is a core focus of our product team in India said Vikas Agarwal OnePluss general manager for India The smartphone maker concentrated on improving battery performance because customers often work long days away from electrical outlets and spend hours commuting through Indian cities thick traffic OnePlus now has a 30 share of the premium segment according to research firm Counterpoint Technologies Apple has 25 of the same segmentOne cost advantage competitors have over Apple is the ability to manufacture their devices in India Doing so helps them avoid a tariff that adds 20 to the already high price of iPhones imported from ChinaApple moved to catch up to rivals last year by setting up a plant near the southern city of Bangalore to assemble its cheapest iPhone model the SE The company sought concessions on the taxes that component makers pay to import materials according to government officialsApple has also sought to open its first official companyowned retail store in India people familiar with the talks said Such stores have been critical in promoting the brand around the world But India requires singlebrand retailers that are more than 51 foreignowned to buy at least 30 of their manufacturing materials from Indian vendorsa hurdle thats hard for Apple to clear given most smartphone components are made elsewhere in AsiaGovernment officials felt the company wasnt focused enough on investing in local production and bringing hightech jobs to India according to a person familiar with the matter Talks stalled The request for concessions is pending and Apple has been unable to move ahead with a store Opening its own stores remains Apple executives top request in ongoing discussions with policy makers according to a government official A government spokeswoman didnt respond to requests for commentMr Cook told analysts last month that discussions with the government have been productive I fully expect that at some point they will agree to allow us to bring our stores into the country he said He also said Apple has communicated with Indias leaders about the countrys import dutiesAs government relations soured the push to sell more devices ran out of steam Some distributors were angered that they were being undercut on price by upstart online shopping websites according to a person familiar with the matterMr Kaul left Apple in late 2017 and was replaced by Michel Coulomb who had overseen South Asia operationsincluding Singapore a successful market He focused on repairing Apples brand by trimming the number of distributors and returning to Apples past strategy of targeting wealthier Indians through thirdparty stores in highend

This could affect Asias economy negatively says Yoshinori Shigemi a global market strategist for JPMorgan FundsOn the China front the OECD has cut its growth forecast to 63 per cent for 2019 and predicts a slowdown to a 30year low of 6 per cent in 2020 A major reason for its weaker outlook is the trade dispute with WashingtonAlong with the trade war Brexit and other political issues like

next general election which is to be held by May 2019 But he may be facing an uphill battle after his party lost big heartland states in recent pollsIndian National Congress the main opposition put in a stellar performance in these semifinals toppling Mr Modis Bharatiya Janata Party in Rajasthan Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh Those victories helped the NC and its leader Rahul Gandhi revive their fortunes though the opposition is still not seen as strong enough to knock the BJP out of central governmentStill the national election will not be a cakewalk for Mr Modi who also faces the growing discontent of distressed farmers and rising unemploymentThe prime minister is most likely to win reelection but at the helm of a coalition rather than with an outright majority of BJP parliamentarians

Joko Widodo against former General Prabowo Subianto a rematch that has been dubbed El Clsico because both men are so familiar to voters But Mr Widodo may also face another persistent challenger in 2019 fickle currency marketsA declining Indonesian rupiah tormented the Widodo government for much of 2018 At one point the currency had fallen as much as 11 per cent against the dollar giving Mr

President Joko Widodo left and Prabowo Subianto will square off again in the election scheduled for April  ReutersThe latest polls show Mr Widodo leading with nearly 55 per cent support with Mr

Nikkei staff writerThree milestones one celebrationThere will be three major milestones for China in 2019 though not all will be celebrated equally or even acknowledgedFrom Beijings point of view the most significant will be the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Peoples Republic of China on October 1 The party will be keen to play up Chinas success in surpassing the former Soviet Unions 69 years of existence to become the longestlasting communist stateIt is a day that Beijing worried might not come The causes of the USSRs collapse have been the subject of intense study among Chinese officials and scholars and many major policy moves in recent years such as the assertion of party primacy over state institutions and the ongoing crackdown on ethnic and religious minorities can be seen in part as attempts to avoid Moscows mistakesTwo landmark studentled campaigns in China will also have anniversaries in 2019 The 1919 May Fourth movement a series of protests reflecting youthful aspirations for national revival fed directly into the founding of the Chinese Communist party two years later The 1989 Tiananmen movement which saw students demand political modernisation culminated

horsechestnut trees started to drop their shiny brown nuts They would select a suitable chestnut drill a hole in it and thread it onto a string then swing their conker at that of an opponent until one of them broke But the game has fallen out of favour Children spend less time outdoors and rarely have access to chestnut trees Besides many schools have banned conkers games worried that they might cause injuries or trigger nut allergiesGet our daily newsletterUpgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editors PicksThat sort of riskaverseness now pervades every aspect of childhood Playgrounds have all the excitement designed out of them to make them safe Many governments particularly in litigious societies such as America have tightened up their rules requiring parents to supervise young children far more closely than in the past Frank Furedi of the University of Kent a critical commentator on modern parenting argues that allowing children to play unsupervised or leaving them at home alone is increasingly portrayed as a symptom of irresponsible parentingIn part such increased caution is a response to the huge wave of changes outlined in this report Largescale urbanisation smaller and more fluid families the move of women into the labour market and the digitisation of many aspects of life have inevitably changed the way that people bring up their children There is little prospect that any of these trends will be reversed so todays more intensive parenting style is likely to persistBut the childrearing practices now embraced by affluent parents in many parts of the rich world particularly in America go far beyond an adjustment to changes in external conditions They amount to a strong bid to ensure that the advantages enjoyed by the parents generation are passed on to their offspring Since success in life now turns mainly on education such parents will do their utmost to provide their children with the schooling the character training and the social skills that will secure access to the best universities and later the most attractive jobsTo some extent that has always been the case But there are more such parents now and they are competing with each other for what economists call positional goodsthings that are in limited supply and that money cannot always buy like those places at top universities This competition starts even before the children are born The prosperous classes will take their time to select a suitable spouse and get married and will start a family only when they feel ready for itChildren from less advantaged backgrounds by contrast often appear before their parents are ready for them In America 60 of births to single women under 30 are unplanned and over 40 of children are born outside marriage And even if those children have two resident parents who are doing their best for them they are still handicapped by a lack of funds knowledge and connections The result certainly in America has been to widen already massive social inequalities yet furtherWhat can be done about this All the evidence suggests that children from poorer backgrounds are at a disadvantage almost as soon as they are born By the age of five or six they are far less schoolready than their betteroff peers so any attempts to help them catch up have to start long before they get to school America has had some success with various schemes involving regular home visits by nurses or social workers to lowincome families with new babies It also has long experience with programmes for young children from poor families that combine support for parents with goodquality child care Such programmes do seem to make a difference Without extra effort children from lowincome families in most countries are much less likely than their betteroff peers to attend preschool education even though they are more likely to benefit from it And data from the OECDs PISA programme suggest that children need at least two years of early preschool education to perform at their best when they are 15So the most promising way to ensure greater equity may be to make earlyyears education and care far more widely available and more affordable as it is in the Nordics Some governments are already rethinking their educational priorities shifting some of their spending to the early yearsMost rich countries decided more than a century ago that free compulsory education for all children was a worthwhile investment for society Since then the schoolleaving age has repeatedly been raised There is now an argument for starting preschool education earlier as some countries have already done Before the Industrial Revolution it was the whole village that minded the children not individual parents In the face of crushing new inequalities a modern version of that approach is worth tryingThis article appeared in theSpecial reportsection of the print edition under the headlineConkering inequalities

unemployment boosted household disposable income and powered strong consumer spending growth A lower corporate tax rate combined with a continued US boom in oil and gas fracking supported business investment Meantime a congressional budget deal in February led to strong US military spending while spending by state and local governments also picked up You had some temporary but powerful supports to growth said Michael Feroli chief US economist for JPMorgan All this convinced the Fed it needed to keep raising shortterm interest rates pushing its benchmark rate up to slightly above 2 with one more quarter percentage point rate increase expected before years end One sector hit by the Feds moves was the interestsensitive housing market where sales and construction slowed in 2018 The central bank saw the increases as necessary to ensure the economy doesnt overheat and cause an outsize jump in inflation or lead to another asset bubble But President Trump voiced strong opposition saying the Fed was undermining his growth agenda While Mr Trumps resistance didnt stop the Fed his views on trade shook up the global economy The president imposed tariffs on steel aluminum washing machines and solar panels in addition to tariffs on 250 billion worth of imports from China He threatened tariffs on car imports globally and the rest of Chinas 505 billion in merchandise exports to the US while pushing Beijing to buy more from the US and stop subsidizing its state industries He also persuaded Canada and Mexico to rewrite the North American Free Trade Agreement Mr Trump expects his toughontrade policies to lead to more exports and investment in the US By the end of 2018 however it helped lead to something else a global economic slowdown The year began with most major economies expanding in sync But by the third quarter output in Germany and Japan had contracted while Chinas economy and global trade volumes slowed The economy started 2018 with a tax cut bang but is ending the year with a trade war whimper said Mark Zandi chief economist at Moodys Economycom Financial markets also started flashing ominous signs A 2017 rally in stock prices stalled while yields on 2year US Treasury notes rose to near the yield on 10year notes a shift in the yield curve that in the past has signaled a recession Can the good times last next year It will depend on how much fiscal stimulus fades how much higher the Fed pushes interest rates and how much farther Mr Trump continues an aggressive trade agenda meant to strengthen the USs hand on the global stage in the long runat the risk of destabilizing the world economy and the US in the short run Mr Feroli sees growth slowing in 2019 as the government stimulus fades but the jobless rate continuing to fall to 33 It might not further a boom but such low unemployment wouldnt be a bad sequel to a year of outsized growth Write to Jon Hilsenrath at jonhilsenrathwsjcom

call,https://www.ft.com/content/be65c8f6-01ee-11e9-9d01-cd4d49afbbe3,2018-12-21 05:00:37,Will Fomo the fear of missing out drive investor behaviour in 2019This is the fourletter acronym that experts at FT Moneys annual investment outlook debate think best describes the dilemma investors will face in the year ahead as market conditions become harder to callVolatility returned with a bang in the final quarter of this year as many different areas of world markets entered correction territory with a fall of 20 per cent or more The more optimistic investor would view this dip as a potential buying opportunity but as political uncertainty intensifies on both sides of the Atlantic they must weigh up Fomo against Folm the fear of losing moneyOur panel of experts was Merryn Somerset Webb an FT columnist and editorinchief of Money Week Chris Giles the FTs economics editor Michael Mackenzie the FTs senior investment commentator Moira ONeill head of personal finance at Interactive Investor and Richard Buxton chief executive of Merian Global InvestorsWill we see greater volatility on world markets next yearMerryn Somerset Webb Twelve months ago I said I was expecting 2018 to be the year that investors suddenly noticed the big change happening in the bond markets as QE quantitative easing became QT quantitative tightening We were right to say markets were coming to the end of one great 30year cycle and this was the year that everything came home for big technology as well We also talked about how cheap UK domestic stocks were getting and I think we could probably say that again except theyre even cheaper nowChris Giles For the past two years the general endofyear sentiment has been horribly wrong After the Brexit vote and Trumps election in 2016 economists and investors were pretty fearful about 2017 yet it turned out to be a fantastic year for the global economyThen at the end of 2017 everyone was really optimistic about 2018 but it has turned out to be very disappointing pretty much everywhere except the USNow more people fear that 2019 could be the year the world slides into recession The global economy has definitively slowed and there is endless talk about whether yield curve inversion in the US is a credible tool for predicting a recession but theres a general negativity that wasnt here last yearSo the question is will things pick up making the end of the year feeling wrong for the third year in a row or are the pessimists going to be proved rightMichael Mackenzie Investors would pose the question are we going to get a bear market in developedworld stocks in 2019 or is it a correction If its the latter then at some point you can try to buy the dip But since October buying the dip hasnt really workedMorgan Stanley recently calculated that 21 major asset classes around the world are negative for the year in real terms We havent seen that since the 1970s which is more evidence of how quantitative tightening has changed the game for a lot of investorsThe other interesting thing this year has been the return of cash Ive asked a lot of investors about their cash position over the past 12 months and pretty much everyone has said its the highest cash weighting Ive had In fact one investment manager I spoke to last month had a 25 per cent cash weightingMerryn So a year ago everything was too expensive now everything is too scaryMichael Its fear of missing out versus the fear of losing your money At the moment Id say more investors fall into the latter camp Theyre turning to cash and superdefensives such as utilities and healthcare although European healthcare stocks are now beginning to turn What is worrying is when you see utilities trading at a higher forward PE priceearnings ratio than tech companies clearly a lot of investors are moving their money in that direction As for the Fomo camp theyre betting that theres still one final hurrah left in this marketIs holding high levels of cash something the big professional investors have in common with the smaller retail investorMoira ONeill From the data on the Interactive Investor platform I can see that on average UK retail investors across all age groups currently hold 18 per cent of their portfolio in cash This rises to 24 per cent for the under35s Thats really quite high and if they hold funds where the manager has a high cash position the percentage could be even higher than they realise We do think UK investors are hesitating because of Brexit One theory could be that theyre holding cash in anticipation of further falls at which point they will pile back in Or perhaps they just dont know what to buyRichard Buxton When youre young its fantastic when markets collapse because you can buy lots more cheaplyMerryn It interests me that the young are holding more cash than the old With the rise of drawdown products you would think that older people would be more likely to hoard cash and fear a yawning crash was lurking around the cornerMoira From our data the over65s are definitely more likely to be looking for income stocks Theyre much more likely to hold direct shares especially FTSE 100 stocks and you see them bargain hunting more and buying all the dips Unlike younger investors theyre not in tracker funds Younger investors are much more global in their outlook compared to older investors and are much more comfortable buying stocks on other exchanges particularly techMerryn Older investors are much more engaged with the idea of investing in individual companies but the young are nearly always invested in funds This has been the huge shift in retail investing across the past 40 yearsSo will investors get one more chance to buy the dip and then were done for the cycleMichael I think well get one more chance The kicker could be whether or not the US economy is stronger than people are predicting The expectation now is that it will start to slow down next year but we are still going to see profit growth just not at such a high rate Its late in the cycle and investors are naturally worriedChris You could argue that what were seeing is not an end of the cycle but a slowing of the really fast growth part of the cycle There has been a whole series of oneoff economic disappointments this year from weatherrelated problems to regulatoryrelated ones particularly in the auto industryThis could support the case for a bounceback Yet there is terrible uncertainty everywhere Leaving Brexit aside people are worried about what the shifting ChinaUS relationship is going to do to the world As a central prediction we should expect 2019 to be slightly worse than 2018 but not terrible Could a no deal Brexit be as bad as the Bank of Englands worstcase scenarioChrisNo but what we could expect is a UK recession of some sort but not necessarily a very deep one The depth would entirely depend on what no one can forecast what UK households and companies will do If consumers tighten their belts it will get very nasty What makes a recession happen every time is the household savings ratio If it goes up rapidly which it did in 2008 and 1992 then you get a nasty recession but this isnt in any of the forecastsThe Bank of Englands forecast was unrealistic because it was based on supply not on demand No economist ever wants to predict demand because you cant thats the psychological aspectMerrynIf there is a nodeal Brexit theres no way that Bank of England governor Mark Carney is going to raise interest rates next year Hes much more likely to cut and there theres lots of scope for doing more QE againRichard I think we all agree that the worstcase scenario is a nodeal fallout Therefore its not beyond the wit of Parliament collectively to put together a bill to retract Article 50Merryn I think youd have to be a very brave MP to vote for thatCould 2019 bring either a second referendum or a UK general electionChrisBoth are looking a lot likelier now than they were a month agoRichard I think we can fairly safely say that therell be a new prime minister at some point next yearMerryn I think a second referendum remains relatively unlikely for one very simple reason what would the question be It would take the Electoral Commission a decade to figure it out I think a nodeal Brexit is pretty unlikely a compromise will be foundChris Regardless of Brexit we still have a productivity problem The UK is at full employment with a pretty low business investment rate which will take a while to kick back in I dont buy the theory of a postBrexit boost from massive pentup investment demand Theres no labour supply and theres not a lot of productivity growth This years going to be pretty weak next year could be marginally better but were still way below the sort of economic growth rates the UK was used to in the 1980s 1990s and early 2000s That may well make companies think twice about investment because the opportunity for huge sales growth just isnt thereMerryn But if the labour market is tight and wages keep rising then surely there is a chance that the next two years could see quite a wave of investment that will then push up productivity in the following three four five yearsChris Just as its hard to come up with a credible very strong economic forecast its hard to come up with a credible very weak forecast as wellWould your view change very dramatically if a Labour government came to powerChris I think wed see weaker economic growth under a Labour government not because anything would happen instantly but because there would be nervousness about exactly what it was going to do Its hard to see Labour winning a stable parliamentary majority so unlike the 1997 Labour government it wouldnt be able to do whatever it likes But what that might be is very unclear because Labour party policy changes all the time and its not consistentMichael We have been asking all the asset managers and private wealth managers for the past 18 months how worried are your clients about Brexit The short answer is theyre not Theyre more worried about Labour and theyre all trying to get their money offshore and make sure if they do have sterling its located in the Channel Islands so it will not be subject to capital controls if they were to come in But their biggest problem of course is highend propertyChrisToo late to get rid of it now Theres been a 30 per cent drop in property prices in some parts of central LondonMerryn There are two areas that worry me First the number of readers who hold an Aim portfolio for inheritance tax reasons certain Aim shares qualify for Business Property Relief if held for over two years before death How IHT is distorting this market is something that the current government never mind a Corbyn government could look at quite quicklySecond capital gains tax If we did get a Corbyn government could stock markets see a very sharp selloff based on the idea that capital gains tax might go up very quickly These are two very obvious taxrelated dangersAway from the UK what factors could weigh on global growthMichaelThis time last year investors thought the dollar would stay weak so everyone was saying fill your boots with local currency emerging market bonds and shares Thats just gone horribly wrong for a lot of people The question for next year is does the dollar remain strong and continue to riseIf it does youve got to keep an eye on the renminbi and Chinas foreign exchange reserves Chinas CSI 300 Index is down more than 20 per cent yeartodateRichardIn the next year were going to have much more talk about the US soft landing because actually it was just supercharged growth this year because of President Trump The next thing could be that bond markets relax and people realise that actually profits may have peaked but they are still growing Thats where we get the potential for the last hurrahSo I think the one to watch is China Theyve lost their current account surplus I think that is something that people dont focus on enough China is now a borrower from the world So the big whammy could be that everyones borrowing and the cost of capital for the borrower simply has got to go up thats the thing that may cause the ultimate end to the cycleChris And we shouldnt forget about corporate borrowing that could also be a big factorMichael BBB bond issues now make up half the investmentgrade bond market and many are the direct result of the recent mergers and acquisitions boom A lot of companies that have done mergers and issued bonds to pay for it have promised rating agencies they will improve their balance sheets over the next 12 to 18 months But if the economy starts to slow then the pressures on If they cant make the grade the rating agencies are going to start pulling the trigger a classic late cycle event The danger is that well start to see more downgrades in 2019 Could General Electric be the canary in the coal mine for whats comingAny other challenges for businesses in 2019Michael Where disruption from tech and innovation turns into destruction The obvious example is as Amazon gets bigger the traditional retailers are taking more of a hit Were seeing it across so many other industries including advertising and the auto sector Its worrying enough that new car sales have plateaued in China but the carmakers also face the challenge of electric vehicles and ridesharing Young people dont see the point in owning a car They rent their music they travel through Airbnb so why not rent a carThere are 30plus FTSE 100 constituents yielding over 5 per cent Could those dividends come under pressure in 2019Michael Thats going to be the big dilemma Income investors are going to have to do their homework in 2019 and the late cycle is always a tricky timeId echo something an investor recently told me about value He runs a value fund Theyve done pretty well in the past six months but as he said if its cheap and you buy it and then it rallies the reason for buying it no longer exists You need to sell Theres an idea that we will see a huge shift out of growth back to value investing I just dont really buy itMoira A lot of investors are simply choosing the fund managers that they think are doing their homework the big brand names who have delivered outperformance year after year are popular across all age groupsRichardFor 30 years I have been saying that UKbased investors have massive home bias Many never bought into the US because it was always just that little bit too expensive relative to the UK Now investors feel happier owning global funds but dont necessarily recognise that over 50 per cent of what theyre buying in the global fund is in the US which theyve notoriously avoided for 30 yearsTheyre just in time to capture these wonderful Faang stocks at prices never to be seen again Whereas the UK bless it is trading on 11 times next years earnings forecasts which looks pretty cheap against the longrun average of 14 times But no one wants to know about the UK and its all gogo globalSo we think UK shares are cheap but could they become even cheaper after next MarchMerryn You can just copy and paste what we said a year ago Theyre cheap and they might get cheaper but no ones buying for a yieldRichard The key to future returns is your starting valuation which is obviously the basis of the value approach We have now had a long period of time in which the multiples have been going up and up and up A lot of fund managers wouldnt touch ITV on a PE ratio of about 10 times with a barge pole but they very happily bought Netflix at 100 timesMichaelWe could talk about how battered UK equity valuations look and whether this is a buying opportunity but I suspect that areas of emerging markets which have been hit a lot harder are where you might want to be instead One of the errors that investors make is that they go back to what has worked before There is a danger that everyones going to pile back into tech and growth stocks next year only to get cleaned out MerrynThis whole discussion has been a reminder that for the past 20 or 30 years investors havent really had to take politics into account too much Were now getting back to the point where we were in the 1970s when these things were so intertwined Thats a huge change for the investing community They now have to look at and understand all sorts of things they didnt before which again could be good for stock pickers in the coming yearRichard It is not normal for equities to go up nine years in a row That was entirely down to QE and was absurd The fact were having a down year is a sign of normalisation but we could also see some real opportunities open up in different asset classes next yearThe FTs investment debate took place in London in midDecember and was chaired by Claer Barrett the FTs personal finance editor

emerging market currenciesDid the witching hour have anything to do with itA first culprit traders pointed to was the thin volumes prevailing at that point in the trading day Liquidity is normally plentiful in currency markets but the hour between New York traders leaving the office and their Tokyo peers arriving has always been a time when investors avoid trading if possible Dubbed the witching hour it refers to between 5pm and 6pm New York time This time the lack of trading volumes was exacerbated by the fact that it was a public holiday in TokyoAnything can happen during the witching hour because liquidity is superlow Normally nothing happens but all the ingredients were there for another flash crash to happen says a yen trader at a large Asian bankWhat about the warning from AppleShortly after the US stock market closed on Wednesday Apple warned that a slowdown in China would leave its fourthquarter revenues shy of expectations Given Apples revelation sharpened investors focus on the risk of a slowing global economy a sharp rally in the yen a traditional haven currency would make some senseHowever the timing of the move and the lack of price action in the Chinese currency have cast some doubt on how important Apples warning was A general deterioration in risk appetite is also unlikely to have been the cause as the Swiss franc a currency that investors pile into during times of stress was also largely unmoved The profit warning from Apple appears to have triggered an algo frenzy in FX but its worth mentioning that Apple news did come around an hour before the market went into meltdown said Lee Oliver head of InTouchFX a market commentary platform for institutional currency tradersAndreas Koenig head of global forex at Amundi Asset Management noted that the Chinese renminbi also remained largely unchanged against the dollar despite Apples warning being focused on the worlds secondlargest economyAnd according to one Australian asset manager if the flash crash was down to Apples announcement the future of currency trading is even more of a worry as negative news on the world economy could continue The concentrated and exaggerated price action in just a few currencies and the magnitude of the moves is beyond whats justified by fundamentals and it highlights a breakdown in market function says Stuart Simmons a senior portfolio manager at Australian superannuation fund QIC Are flash crashes becoming more commonThey have become an increasing feature of forex markets as algorithmic when strategies are executed by computer programmes based on predefined levels and outcomes trading has taken hold and as regulation cut banks ability to make markets in currencies In October 2016 months after the Brexit vote sterling plunged about 9 per cent against the dollar in a matter of minutes during the same illiquid period between the NY close and the Asian open The New Zealand dollar and the South African rand have experienced similar episodes in the past two yearsMarket participants say that a depletion of human trading experience over the past five years is also to blame Veteran traders have been leaving the industry in the wake of the benchmark rigging scandal that started in 2013 at the same time algorithmic market makers have increased their share in price provision and investors have also started to turn to algos for executing their ordersThis is what happens when all the traders are killed machines dont whisper said one forex market veteranMr Koenig of Amundi adds that there is a lot of hotpotato trading in the market and very little risk warehousing This means that we will see these type of events more often in the future and while its not really an issue for forex investors its a big concern for risk managersWere risks building up in the dollaryen exchange rateSome traders pointed to positioning as a factor as the Japanese yen has been a popular currency to borrow in and then sell to make wages in higheryielding currencies This strategy called the carry trade has been a staple for Japanese retail traders for years and become increasingly popular for institutional investors The relative stability of the dollar against the yen over the course of 2018 also contributed to a buildup of exotic derivatives bets on a rising dollar according to one yen trader So as the yen surged big options barriers might have got knocked out and added to the impetus for algorithms to sell the greenback Still positioning and the popularity of carry strategies is not enough to explain the price swing There is an awful lot of pessimism going into 2019 but to have a flash crash on the first trading day suggests that the omen for the year ahead is pretty terrible said the trader at the Asian bank

first week of January Jeremy Grantham the founder of asset manager GMO who predicted the dotcom and housing bubbles warned that the almost euphoric rally was the harbinger of bad news But with investors still basking in the effect of the US tax cut on corporate profits not many were listening as January became one of the best months for global equities since the financial crisis But over the next few weeks much of Januarys rally unravelled as investors had their first taste that 2018 would be far more volatile than 2017VixmageddonAs would be the case later in the year the bond market inflicted the initial damage on equities A steep rise in average US earnings in January raised the fear of inflation sending bond yields sharply higher But the decline in stocks turned violent as inversevolatility funds or those linked to the Vix volatility index that traders used to bet on markets remaining tranquil buckled Their collapse on February 5 rippled through the US stock market as banks and other traders rushed to hedge their own positions It resulted in one of the swiftest 10 per cent corrections in historyDeFaangedAs the dust of Vixmageddon settled investors were confronted by a threat to the handful of tech behemoths known as the Faangs which in recent years powered US stocks higher While concerns over the Faangs had been brewing for some time claims in March that analysis group Cambridge Analytica had mined the personal data of 50m Facebook users for use in the US presidential election crystallised fears that big tech risked tougher regulationWhile each of the Faangs Apple Amazon Netflix Google parent Alphabet and Facebook faced different challenges this year has proved tougher for each than 2017 It is just like a helium balloon that can only fly so high before eventually the helium wears off and the balloon floats back to earth Michael Underhill chief investment strategist at Capital Innovations said of this years trading in FaangsDollar reboundAt the annual January gathering of the business and political elite in Davos Switzerland US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin sent the dollar lower by voicing the administrations preference for a weaker currency Although Mr Mnuchins comments were a taste of the trade tensions that would simmer and occasionally erupt between the US and its trading partners during 2018 talk of a falling dollar had been forgotten by AprilWith expectations for both US economic growth and interest rates rising the dollar began a rally that confounded forecasts The dollar index a broad measure of the currency jumped more than 8 per cent between the middle of April and midAugust Analysts at JPMorgan called the dollar revival the most notable phenomenon of the yearTurkey meltdownA resurgent dollar proved particularly painful for emerging markets whose bonds equities and currencies began falling in the spring Turkey was one of the hardest hit thanks partly to its president Recep Tayyip Erdogan He provided a contender for quote of the year in May after declaring interest rates the mother of all evil in effect kicking off a fullblown currency crisisThe combination of higher inflation a rising dollar and doubts over the Turkish central banks resolve to raise rates unleashed the liras plunge with a row over a detained American pastor fanning the crisis The currency kept on sliding at times dramatically through the summer even raising concerns about how the situation could pinch European banksThe central bank took some of the steam out of the decline with a series of backdoor tightening measures and eventually took the initiative in September with a hefty rise in interest rates Italian alarmAs the pressure on EMs intensified in late spring investors attention was yanked back to developed markets by Italy The countrys March election saw populist parties Five Star and the League come top a result virtually ignored by investors That had changed by late May as the two parties formed a governmentItalian bond yields spiralled higher as investors scrutinised the new governments spending plans After a lull during summer Italy was again in investors crosshairs in early autumn as the government prepared its debut budget The budget which was announced in October prompted the EU to begin disciplinary measures against Rome for breaking the blocs fiscal rules While December saw Italian bonds rally in anticipation of a budget agreement that the EU and Rome reached on December 19  there is scepticism over whether the tensions are overThis looks like a patchy compromise which allows both the Italian government and the commission to buy time and kick the can down the road possibly until after European elections in May 2019 said Lorenzo Codogno founder of LC Macro Advisors and a former chief economist at the Italian TreasuryArgentinas emergencyAs Turkeys currency crisis deepened over the summer Argentina was arguably the hardest hit among South American countries by the souring in sentiment towards EMs Beaten down by an ugly decline in the currency after the government asked the International Monetary Fund to speed up the disbursement of muchneeded cash the central bank in late August lifted interest rates from 45 per cent to some 60 per centThe initial market reaction was downbeat with the currency dropping 12 per cent on the day Since then some stability has returnedRed OctoberRising bond yields were the initial trigger for the February squall in stocks and October saw a replay Bond yields had been quietly climbing since the summer but Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell quickened the selloff in early October by saying interest rates were a long way from neutral Investors took that as a hint that the central bank could step up the pace of monetary tightening that had already delivered three rate rises in 2018 That triggered a stock market tremor that grew in intensity and culminated in a selloff that analysts dubbed Red OctoberAlmost everything that had done well earlier in the year was at the centre of the selloff especially technology stocks European and EM equities had already suffered a bruising 2018 but when the years strongest performers suddenly dropped it sent global equities into correction territory typically defined as a 10 per cent drop from a recent highAnalysts say the slump was exacerbated by automated selling by some volatilitytargeting algorithmic trading strategies and wrongfooted hedge funds that had flocked to tech stocks and were then forced to liquidate positions The result was one of the worst months for global equities since the financial crisis Oils spillIn early October oil prices were up almost 30 per cent for the year Brent crude the international benchmark had topped 86 a barrel and there was even speculation that 100 a barrel could be reached But such talk would quickly look fantastical as a mix of concern over robust US oil output strongerthanexpected Iranian production after sanctions and weakening demand sent prices tumblingWhile that cheered US president Donald Trump who was keen to keep gas prices low it was enough to alarm Saudi Arabia and other Opec producers which in early December delivered a production cut of just over 1m barrels a day But a roughly 12 per cent drop in the oil price since the cartels cut suggests that the headwinds remainDecember mayhemAlthough a government bond market selloff unsettled stocks in February and October it was a stunning rally in the market that began in November that unnerved equities into the end of the year The yield on the benchmark 10year Treasury fell from 324 per cent in November 8 to 28 per cent on December 21 as fixedincome investors began to anticipate slower US expansion in 2019With analysts ratcheting their forecasts for corporate earnings down sharply US equities fell further Investors angst deepened when the Fed delivered its fourth rate rise of the year on December 19 and Mr Powell said the central bank was sticking with a steady shrinking of its balance sheetThat helped drive the US yield curve commonly measured by looking at the difference between two and 10year Treasury yields to its lowest level since 2007 Historically an inversion of the yield curve when shortterm yields rise above those on longerdated ones has proved an accurate precursor to a recession While no economists are predicting that for the US in 2019 rattled investors are ending the year by heading for the exitWith reporting by Nicole Bullock Katie Martin Robin Wigglesworth Kate Allen Philip

just about a winAnother area of the debt market that has benefited from the US central banks interest rate increases this year is socalled leveraged loansSuch loans are typically debt issued to

Turkey was a crisis candidate noting that a crackdown on dissent against the government and official unease at a shadowy interest rate lobby posed grave risks to the currency It was for him a favoured underweight positionIt took some time for this to crystallise but the blowup in Turkish assets in 2018 was spectacular On the campaign trail for elections in May president Recep Tayyip Erdogan labelled interest rates the mother of all evil hitting the lira hard A team of more marketfriendly advisers was forced to quickly hop on a plane to London to douse down the rhetoric for alarmed London fund managers But President Erdogan did not back down sending the lira into fullblown crisis It was not until the central bank plucked up the courage for a large rate rise in September that the situation came under controlAt that point Mr McNamara wrote that EM slumps were often followed by savage bounces He flipped his position as the lira began an impressive recovery A bright spot in a

expected to be announced on Wednesday comes as Democrats whove vowed to grill him over his conduct are about to take control of the House of Representatives raising the prospect of heightened oversight  and a crush of legal bills from defending himself Concern about all the scrutiny and legal costs on the horizon were factors in Zinkes decision to quit said the people who asked not to be identified to discuss it The impending departure also emerges as President Donald Trump grapples with other changes to his Cabinet that underscore the challenges of filling vacancies in a tumultuous administration On Friday the president announced that budget director Mick Mulvaney would take over as chief of staff replacing John Kelly whose ouster on Dec 8 touched off a rollercoaster search to fill the key White House post Trumps been aware of Zinkes plans for several days and a search for a replacement is under way the people said Energy Dominance Zinke had championed using federal lands to pursue US energy dominance and that agenda will be continued by his likely successor as acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt the agencys No 2 official As deputy hes played a key behindthescenes role in shaping the departments policies Other potential contenders for the post include Cynthia Lummis a former congresswoman from Wyoming Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes Adam Laxalt the Nevada attorney general who lost his bid to be governor  Idaho Governor CL Butch Otter former Nevada Senator Dean Heller who lost his reelection bid in November and outgoing Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker The role is typically filled by Western politicians who have experience navigating the vast federal lands Zinke had emerged as the chief target for Democrats who will control the House in the new Congress The swirl of ethics probes also made him a lightning rod in the Trump Cabinet In November he publicly tangled with Representative Raul Grijalva of Arizona the Democrat set to lead the House panel that oversees the Interior Department After Grijalva wrote an opinion piece in USA Today calling on Zinke to resign over a series of ethical and managerial failings Zinke fired back on Twitter alleging drunken and hostile behavior by the Democrat The Interior Departments inspector general had initiated at least seven investigations directly targeting Zinke A separate independent federal investigative agency also has opened as many as six other inquiries into allegations Zinke engaged in improper political activity  a volume that invited comparisons to the ousted Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt Trump has offered tepid praise for Zinke saying in November that he is doing an excellent job  but the president also said he was looking at allegations about his Interior chief Zinke played a leading part in the presidents campaign to roll back environmental regulations and promote American energy development The Interior Department moved to auction off more oil leases ended a moratorium on new sales of federally owned coal and repealed mandates governing drilling But the agency also continued work to advance renewable power culminating in a recordsetting sale on Friday of offshore wind leases near Massachusetts A former Navy SEAL and congressman from Montana Zinke frequently invoked his military experience to make the case for making the US the strongest energy superpower this world has ever known arguing that US soldiers shouldnt have to fight overseas for a commodity we have here Zinkes focus on Trumps energy agenda won cheers from oil gas and mining advocates who credit the Trump administration with seeking to balance recreation and conservation with prudent development on public lands His possible replacement Bernhardt is a skilled lawyer whos worked for an array of oil companies and developers with business before the Interior Department He could start to serve in an acting capacity immediately and if Trump later nominates him for the position he could serve for years in a temporary status under federal law even without Senate confirmation Zinke initially won tentative support from conservationists public lands advocates and outdoor enthusiasts who were encouraged by his position of resisting Republican efforts to return US federal lands to states But their enthusiasm turned to alarm after he began reexamining the boundaries of national monuments set aside by recent presidents and ultimately setting up Trumps decision to slash the size of the Bears Ears and Grand StaircaseEscalante sites in Utah Environmental groups outdoor gear company Patagonia Inc and North American tribes are challenging the action in federal court arguing federal law doesnt give presidents the power to shrink national monuments created by their predecessors Zinkes also drawn scrutiny for his handling of a draft plan for selling oil and gas leases in coastal waters over the next five years Just days after the Interior Department released an initial proposal opening the possibility of auctioning drilling rights in more than 90 percent of US Outer Continental Shelf waters Zinke offered a surprise promise that he would keep new platforms away from Florida Critics said that was a political ploy designed to help Floridas Republican governor Rick Scott in his successful bid to unseat Democratic Senator Bill Nelson and they said the pronouncement provides fodder for future lawsuits over offshore drilling Critics also have seized on the crush of investigations targeting Zinke with Grijalva poised to lead the House Natural Resources Committee describing an ethical mess plaguing the department The most serious investigation involves a land deal in Zinkes hometown of Whitefish Montana between a charitable foundation he created and a property development group backed by David J Lesar the chairman of oilfield services provider Halliburton Co Possible Conflict The foundation run by Zinkes wife Lolita is allowing Lesar and his family to use a portion of its land as a parking lot for a planned development Democrats have suggested that a meeting Zinke held in 2017 with Lesar Lesars son and a Montana developer may have violated federal conflict of interest laws given the companys broad interests before the Interior Department Zinke has said he stopped being involved in foundation matters after becoming secretary and Halliburton has said Lesars personal involvement in a small real estate development has nothing to do with the company The inspector general has referred the probe to the Justice Department for further investigation opening the possibility of a criminal prosecution Another inquiry is looking into Zinkes decision to block Indian tribes from building a casino in Connecticut after lobbying from their chief competitor MGM Resorts International and despite the advice of employees with the Interior Departments Bureau of Indian Affairs And Interiors inspector general previously concluded Zinke could have avoided spending 12375 on a charter flight last year and faulted the secretary for allowing his wife to accompany him in US government vehicles Other investigations have encountered resistance For instance the IG last year closed a probe of alleged political threats against Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski determining after a preliminary review that further investigation would prove unproductive And the agency watchdog ultimately concluded in another case that limited record keeping prevented the office from ascertaining whether the reassignment of dozens of senior Interior Department employees violated federal law

downturn while easing off its push to hold back debt in a policy shift that could help Beijing withstand shortterm shocks from the trade conflict with Washington but add to longerterm risksAn economic blueprint approved Friday by President Xi Jinping and the rest of the leadership calls for ensuring Chinas growth within a reasonable range in 2019 with a combination of measures aimed at spurring investment and consumption They include allowing easier credit especially to local governments and expanding tax cutsThe plan laid out at a closeddoor conclave held between Wednesday and Friday comes as Chinas economy faces growing headwindsfrom weakening household spending and declining industrial output to anemic investment in factories and other bigticket projects The Trump administrations trade offensive against Beijing also has cast a pall over Chinas growth prospects A fullbore trade war threatens to slash economic expansionestimated to be around 65 for 2018by as much as 15 percentage points next year according to some government advisersA complicated and grim external environment is how the leadership put it in a statement issued by staterun Xinhua News AgencyOne of the great mysteries on the world stage right now is the state of trade tensions between the US and China Are tensions getting better or worse WSJs Gerald F Seib weighs recent developments Photo APChinas growth has been on a controlled descent for most of this decade propped up at times by shots of easy credit that have made debt a longterm threat for the maturing economy During the past two years with growth still buoyant Mr Xi has taken aim at debt and other financial risks to put the economy on sounder footingIn recent months however that campaign has taken a toll resulting in an economy decelerating faster than Beijing expected The trade fight with the US is making the debtcontrol initiative even more unsustainable according to officials and government advisersAt the annual yearend meeting that sets the economic agenda for the coming year called the Central Economic Work Conference senior officials and leaders who gathered at the heavily guarded Jingxi Hotel in western Beijing sought to strike a balance between the needs to stabilize growth and to continue fending off financial risksThe plan released Friday keeps risk control as a major task for 2019 It also promises to use tax cuts on a greater scale and significantly increase the size of bond issuance by local governments which have long been under Beijings scrutiny for running up debtThe dual message risks deepening a policy muddle that Chinese and foreign economists have said is confusing local officials and discouraging private entrepreneursChinas multiplicity of conflicting objectives persists and is intensifying said Gene Frieda global strategist at Pacific Investment Management CoAt the meeting the leadership also set its annual growth target for next year though the figure likely wont be disclosed until Chinas legislature convenes in March Economists widely expect Beijing to announce a grossdomesticproduct goal for next year that is lower than this years benchmark of about 65A reduced target would signal a determination not to adopt massive stimulus measures as deployed in the financial crisis a decade ago Those major infrastructure and property investments fueled by huge amounts of credit started the debt hangover still felt todayFridays blueprint stresses the need to prevent speculative home buying reflecting continuing leadership concerns about aggravating already high housing pricesChina has been gradually easing fiscal and monetary policies in recent months to combat the slowdown The central bank has injected more funds into the banking system Beijing has relaxed restrictions on localgovernment borrowing the government has rolled out tax cuts for both businesses and individualsIn a sign of a loosening credit policy the 2019 plan dropped the word neutral and kept the description prudent when describing Chinas monetary stanceThe plan also seeks to bolster waning public confidence in Beijings resolve to carry out marketoriented overhauls Under President Xi Beijing in the past few years has increased the governments role in the economy supporting stateowned companies with loans and subsidies while increasing pressure on both private and foreign businesses That shift has become a focal point of the Trump administrations complaints over Chinas unfair trade practicesNext year according to the new economic blueprint the leadership will follow up on its longtime pledge to broaden private capitals access to the state sector In particular it listed state giantChina Railway Coas a trial for mixedownership reforma euphemism for bringing in private investmentProminently absent from the 2019 plan is any mention of an industrial policy criticized by President Trump as protectionist known as Made in China 2025 Instead it talked about the importance of promoting highquality development of the manufacturing sectorAs part of its effort to ease trade tensions according to people briefed on the matter Chinas top planning agency and senior policy advisers are drafting a replacement for Made in China that promises reduced subsidies for state firms and greater access for foreign companies to the countrys manufacturing sectorIn a nod to the 90day trade truce reached by Presidents Xi and Trump in Argentina on Dec 1 the plan said Beijing will strive to continue liberalizing its markets next year and to promote economic consultations between China and the USWrite to Lingling Wei at linglingweiwsjcom

years of trying An argument gaining ground in Tokyo holds that the inflation goal once seen as paramount doesnt matter so much after allEmployment is more important than targeting prices said Koichi Hamada an economist and retired Yale University professor who was one of the architects of Prime Minister Shinzo Abes progrowth Abenomics policyThat notion runs against the priorities long established by Bank of Japan Gov Haruhiko Kuroda as well as a global consensus among central bankers that it is important to set an inflation target of 2 or more and commit to meeting itUpon taking office in March 2013 Mr Kuroda vowed to hit 2 inflation believing it would bring Japan out of a negative spiral of falling prices sluggish wages and weak consumption Reaching the target also looked like a way to lower real interest rates for companies and home buyers who could borrow at Japans rockbottom rates and watch as inflation chipped away at the real value of their debtWhile Abenomics has achieved many of its goalsincluding bringing unemployment down to 24 and presiding over Japans secondlongest postwar economic expansionthis year has shown that the inflation target is as far out of reach as everInflation excluding volatile fresh food and energy prices was just 03 in November and it has barely budged all yearA year ago The Wall Street Journal cited Torikizoku Chicken Nobility a budget restaurant chain offering skewers of yakitori grilled chicken as an example of how inflation might finally be picking up The chain lifted prices for the first time in nearly 30 years blaming a shortage of parttime staff It raised the price of a twoskewer plate by the equivalent of 16 cents to 265Once prices went up it wasnt just the chickens that got skewered Samestore sales at the chain have fallen more than 5 every month since May and profit fell 76 compared with a year earlier in the most recent quarterThere are many similar izakaya restaurants which serve a plate around 280 yen So if the price is higher I dont have to come to Torikizoku said Takeru Sato 24 who came to Torikizoku recently with colleagues after work A company spokesman said it wasnt planning to cut prices and hoped to win back customers with improved quality Some courageous companies raised prices eventually confirming that they didnt have pricing power After those examples of failures other Japanese companies grew even more cautious said Tsutomu Watanabe a Tokyo University professor and a former BOJ officialMr Abe has largely stopped discussing the dangers of deflation and his government is actually trying to push some prices down ahead of a tax increase set to take effect in October 2019 Mr Abes de facto No 2 Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga has called on mobilephone carriers to lower fees by about 40a move that could knock a full percentage point off inflation according to government estimatesThere is no change to our stance of seeking the 2 price goal as soon as possible by patiently continuing powerful easing Mr Kuroda said at a November press conference At the same time he has started talking more about the potential downsides of aggressive monetary easing including the hit to banks profit marginsThe central bank hasnt moved on policy for months and took no action Thursday at its regular policy meeting suggesting it doesnt see the lack of progress toward reaching the inflation target as serious enough to warrant a responseMr Hamada the Abe adviser said the BOJ should consider revising its policy of negative interest rates under which commercial banks are in effect charged a fee in some cases for parking their money at the central bankAs long as the labor market tightness continues and the real economy is strong there is little ground to keep the negative interestrate policy that creates lots of discontinuity in the financial market Mr Hamada saidThe yield on 10year Japanese government bonds which the BOJ currently fixes around zero could also be liberalized he saidThe trend toward deemphasizing 2 inflation has furnished an Itoldyouso moment for Mr Kurodas predecessor Masaaki Shirakawa who broke years of silence recently with a 750page memoir that implicitly took issue with the Kuroda eraMr Shirakawa wrote that he agreed only reluctantly at the end of his term to work with the Abe government to achieve 2 inflation and successfully fought to keep a deadline out of the agreement He said it was dangerous to cling to a specific price level in part because of biases in price dataWhat is more important isto aim for sustainable price stability in the medium to long term he wroteUnlike Mr Shirakawa Mr Kuroda in 2013 did commit to a deadline for reaching 2 inflationtwo yearsonly to keep missing it The BOJ no longer gives an estimate of when the target will be reachedStill BOJ officials are hesitant to abandon the target altogether out of fear it could damage expectations and push the country back into deflation said people familiar with the BOJs thinkingWrite to Megumi Fujikawa at megumifujikawawsjcom

they had tried and failed to tackle their financial resolutions for more than a yearLast year was dreadful for world stock markets with the FTSE 100 index falling by 125 per centRachel Winter senior investment manager at Killik and Co says she understands the increasing desire to hold cash For the first time since 1994 the return on cash beat the returns on both the stock market and the bond marketHowever Thomas Eyles director of Lathe amp Co Wealth Advisers cautions that those holding cash risk losing out on any share price rises With doom and gloom all around its tempting to sell into cash within Isas and pensions to see out the storm However more often than not this results in missing opportunities when the rebounds occur Ms Winter adds For longer time horizons those who hold cash will see their wealth eroded by inflation In the UK inflation currently stands at 22 per cent and there are very few bank accounts paying interest above this amount The best rates tend to be on current accounts where banks use a higher rate to tempt customers to switch Nationwide offers 5 per cent gross interest for a year on balances up to 2500 TSB will pay 5 per cent on the first 1500 and Tesco Bank offers 3 per cent on balances up to 3000 Many current accounts offer regular saver accounts if you pledge to save a fixed monthly amount for a whole year For example you can get 5 per cent interest on a maximum saving of 300 a month at First Direct Nationwide HSBC and MampS Bank all offer 5 per cent interest for those who save up to 250 a month Halifax offers a regular saver for children paying 45 per cent interest on a maximum saving of 100 per month The best easy access rate is the new Marcus account by Goldman Sachs which offers a oneyear bonus rate of 15 per cent on balances up to 250000 The best oneyear savings bond is currently from Atom Bank which offers 205 per cent interest on a minimum online deposit of 50 Many FT readers told us they had resolved to teach their children much more about managing their own finances and investments this year a view echoed by many of our experts As FT reader Bruce Swanson put it Doesnt Bomad the bank of Mum and Dad have an

December the US Senate passed a resolution to halt US support for the warEXCLUSIVE RENEWABLE ENERGY EXECUTIVE LAYS DOWN THE GAUNTLETThe world needs to speed up the adoption rate for renewable energy in order to beat climate change said Henrik Poulsen the chief executive for rsted one of the worlds biggest producers of offshore wind powerIn an interview late last year Mr Poulsen noted while renewable energy such as solar power has been widely deployed carbon emissions linked to an increase in global temperatures are still risingIn October a United Nations report said failure to limit global warming within 12 years could risk irreversible changes to the earths climate and ecosystemsAt this pace the world is set to miss the environmental targets set at the 2015 Paris climate accord The Trump administration pulled the US out of the accord last yearMr Poulsen said the Danishbased conglomerate which has wind farms in Europe and Asia aims to do its bit to advance the green energy transition by expanding its footprint in the USFormerly known as Dong Energy the company last year changed its name to rsted after a 19thcentury Danish scientist as part of a move away from fossil fuelsLast October the firm also announced plans to buy Deepwater Wind from hedge fund DE Shaw Group for 510 million as it gears up for an expected expansion of wind power off the East CoastThe following are edited excerpts from the interview with Mr PoulsenQ You are planning to invest 200 billion Danish krone just over 30 billion into green energy by 2025 Where are you going to put that moneyA The vast majority of our spending will be going into offshore wind mostly in Europe but also North American and Asia We have recently built a platform for onshore renewables in North America but we will also be looking into solar power and storage technology We see a few areas for offshore wind along the east coastSecondly we are also engaged in onshore wind so far mostly in Texas but we will also be moving into the wind belt in Nebraska Montana Minnesota and that part of the countryQ There is a perception that you cant make money of renewables without subsidies what would you say to thatA I think thats true Most renewables today still require some levels of subsidies but it should be noted that those subsidies have decreased dramatically over the past 34 years We have seen the cost of offshore wind dropping by 60 in 4 years So today when you look at the 2019 auction for UK for offshore wind the difference paid by the government is very close to the market priceQ Why do many countries in Asia and some in Africa still consider coal to be the cheapest energy source and how can the proponents of green energy persuade them otherwiseA You have seen this drop in the cost of renewables That has removed a lot of the economic concerns around the transition to green energyBut there is a second concern about the security of supply which needs to be considered Then in some markets there is the concern about the impact on local industries for instance the coal industry if thats a significant factor in a given country like Germany or the USSo it takes problem solving and political leadership to find solutions to those challenges while still moving forward at an appropriate speed Right now we are moving too slowly I have a lot of sympathy and understanding but the nearterm challenges should not get in the way of us preserving the future of the planetNo doubt putting a meaningful price on CO2 is probably the best mechanism for a marketdriven transition toward green energy

having a smart shoe wardrobe Some of the advice is fairly benign other titbits such as its advocation of coffee enemas or consulting a shamanic energy medicine practitioner have invited widespread criticism and anger But true Goopers arent deterred They buy Goopendorsed books accessories vitamin tablets clothes skincare products and sex aids And increasingly they meet other Goopers at Goop summits the next will be in London this spring where they pay up to 2000 to take part in wellness workshops yoga sessions and meditation classes Not bad for an actress with little or no experience in internet publishing who conceived her business plan at her kitchen table in Belsize ParkOK so she wasnt exactly an unknown when she decided to launch Her brand was already global she had more than a decade of magazine covers behind her and when she talks about seeing a marketing guy in New York who gave me the name Goop and hooked me up with a guy to get it going one must appreciate that hers is a circle that includes people like Steven Spielberg who is her godfather and Brian Chesky the internet billionaire and cofounder of Airbnb whom Paltrow still calls up for adviceIts bizarre to think back on I had such a different life then says Paltrow of the life crisis that precipitated Goop I was completely burned out I had done 40 films in a decade and even though there were aspects of it that were incredible it was also pretty lonely I was on the road alone a lot And I had had my daughter and I thought I dont want to do that any more And then I started to realise I was very interested in the digital space I certainly had no idea what I was getting myself into she adds I was trying to figure out WordPress alone in my kitchen It was ridiculousWe are waiting for the room service Paltrow has ordered a club sandwich fresh tomato soup and french fries I have chosen a Nioise salad and tomato soup with tea Is she on any diet right now It sort of goes in phases she says Right now I dont know what Im going for I eat whatever I want and then I clean up my act for 10 days She sighs French fries are my favourite food And I love alcohol So its a balance Im a real person who wants to eat delicious stuffAnnoyingly she has few of the physical flaws one might expect of a real 46yearold Yes she has the faintest of crinkles around the eyes and years of intense exercise have sculpted her physique from waifish fragility to svelte athleticism but she looks pretty much the same as the woman who leapt to global fame in the 1995 thriller Se7en Not everyone was convinced by her early homilies to the benefits of skin cupping and juice fasts But Paltrow who first became interested in clean living while investigating alternative treatments following her fathers diagnosis with oral cancer in 1999 forged ahead As a spokesperson for wellness she was a pioneer and considering that the market is now estimated by the Global Wellness Institute to be worth some 42tn one imagines she feels quite smugI started writing about this kind of stuff when it was ahead of the curve and we are still ahead of the curve Even when I started to do yoga preinternet I remember there being very cynical articles about how yoga was culty and weird and for freaks Its been great watching the seachange I had this funny experience the other day where I went to a yoga studio in LA and the beautiful 22yearold girl behind the counter was like Have you ever done yoga before And I was like Bitch you have this job because Ive done yoga beforeIts an anecdote Ive read before But I like it because it sums up precisely the kind of sororal candour that has won her both fans and a good few detractors No matter how real handson and Hey lets just order french fries she may be people take issue with her life of vitamin blasts and blithe entitlementBut this is bullshit she says of accusations that Goop represents privilege This idea that wellness is aspirational and for rich people its absolutely not true at all At the crux of it the true tenets of wellness meditation eating whole foods drinking a lot of water sleeping well thinking good thoughts trying to be optimistic are all freePaltrow doesnt pretend that her lithe figure and glowy complexion are genetic gifts But in sharing the extent of her exercises and skinbrushing techniques she can seem quite extreme I think the reason why people get pissed off with me is because Im like No I actually work my ass off in all areas of my life she says Some people are really inspired by that and some people are annoyed by itLunch is served arranged prettily by two waiters who are quite giddy to be around her The tomato soup is fresh and flavoursome The club sandwich is a towering classic of the fivestarhotel school Paltrow gets stuck inWas she always so driven I think Im very competitive with myself she says flicking a bit of bacon from the sandwich Part of that is really healthy and I think part of it is really unhealthy Part of me has a real perfectionist streak and its punishing and its not great but the upside is I always want to be squeezing the marrow out of lifeGoop is a tidy little business It was incorporated in 2013 Paltrow raised 10m in 2015 and a further 15m in a second round Her investors include the venture capitalist firms Felix Capital and New Enterprise Associates NEA she was made chief executive of Goop in 2017 What is it like I wonder to be Gwyneth Paltrow while pitching for investmentOh its hilarious And so brutal she replies Firstly every investor will take the meeting And then for about the first 90 seconds I am Gwyneth Paltrow and maybe they want a selfie for their wife and maybe they tell me about how much they loved The Royal Tenenbaums And then you sit down to do the presentation its like Oh shit this is what its like to be an entrepreneur Its such a great lesson because when youre a famous personpeople are always treating you with kid gloves and removing obstacles for you Investor meetings were a huge wakeup call in the best way It was when I realised Id been treated like a fake person for 20 yearsPaltrow has now been running the show for three years but she is unequivocal about the chief executive job No question she says Its the hardest thing Ive ever doneOne lesson she has had to learn is greater rigour In a muchpublicised lawsuit last September Goop was forced to pay 145000 in fines for unsubstantiated marketing claims regarding the sale of her stone eggs one jade and another quartz Goop literature said that when inserted into the vagina the eggs could fix hormone levels and aid bladder control The consumer protection lawsuit filed by Santa Clara County district attorney Jeff Rosen and nine other state prosecutors found those claims to be bunkumAs you grow you realise you have a lot of responsibility and accountability says Paltrow Were getting very buttonedup about all that stuff now she adds I think the scariest thing for me is not knowing what I dont know I have made huge mistakes because I didnt know those particular mistakes were even conceivably possible to makeShe segues briefly to another misstep migrating to a new email server not the sexiest of subjects considering Im talking to a woman who actually knows what its like to date Brad Pitt But Paltrow seems to care far more about her MailChimp woes than she regrets acting opportunities she might have lost Does she feel more fulfilled by her work today No Its apples and oranges she replies Acting is so myopic and emotional When youre acting youre in your little silo and youre learning your lines and youre doing your part and youre an important part but you are still only an important cog in the wheel Creating and executing a business strategy is far more stimulatingThat said Paltrow did recently revisit her role as Pepper Potts for the upcoming Avengers outing of the current Marvel franchise Was being on set a holiday or did she sit in her trailer with a tonne of Excel spreadsheets Obviously the latter And thank God I have my spreadsheets because I would go crazy now in a trailer she says I was on set with my lovely chief of staff and she was like I cant believe how much were sitting around And I was like I cant believe I used to do this with no internet and no business to run on the sideFilm sets have changed in other ways as well As the princess of Miramax productions Paltrow was once the prized asset of Harvey Weinstein When allegations of sexual misconduct first arose about the producer Paltrow went public with her own story about how Weinstein had tried to make a pass at her in 1995 when they were alone in a hotel room At the time Brad Pitt threatened to kill Weinstein if he did anything like it again And he didnt But until last year Paltrow was silent Has the culture of Hollywood changedFor sure she says You can see it smell it taste it its different We used to roll our eyes or grit our teeth and be like Oh thats gross and shake it off But now if you were to do those things to a 24yearold in the workplace there would absolutely be repercussions I think its very healthy and long overdue And Im proud I played a little part in itAs for Goop can it grow beyond its founders image Ultimately I want to get out of peoples faces she says But there are clearly huge gains to be had from a Paltrow endorsement You have to be very judicious about when you pull that lever she saysIm very competitive with myself but the upside is I always want to be squeezing the marrow out of lifeShe is confident however that the brand will outgrow her I think you could say that for any founder business even if theyre not a consumerfacing CEO argues Paltrow But you can always point to somebody like Coco Chanel or Walt Disney brands that have always been associated with people I mean I didnt name Goop GwynethPaltrowLifestyleBlogcom I always knew that I wanted it to be much bigger than I am and to be more of a legacy She talks of Stella McCartney an old friend whose label is so much bigger than McCartney herself because it stands for some amazing valuesI ask what Goops amazing values might be I think people see were trying to solve problems for the modern woman she says That might be getting better sleep feeling more energetic or eating more healthily Often it means improving their sexual health as wellAbsolutely she says When we write about female sexual health people always get completely up in arms I always think to myself why is this so threatening I think women really appreciate our content because were trying to create a space where theres no shame and you can ask questions I think its also refreshing as a woman who considers herself a respectable professional woman that I have an article about anal sex on the website It gives people permission to ask a question or to be curious about it Thats a great thing She smiles Its a very small aspect of what we write about but it gets a lot of coverage as you can imagineLunch is over A team of stylists has arrived to prepare Paltrow for her next appointment Things are on the move Oh God Why did I eat so much Paltrow moans as she poses for a mandatory selfie My stomach feels enormous It looks tiny Of courseHer eyes fall on the flowers Do you want them Im leaving tomorrow and theyll only go in the trash I take the flowers Flowers from Goop Im

independence with Pakistan the country has been known for its tragedies wrenching poverty natural disasters and now one of the worlds biggest refugee crises after the influx of 750000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing persecution in neighbouring MyanmarYet with remarkably little international attention Bangladesh has also become one of the worlds economic success stories Aided by a fastgrowing manufacturing sector its garment industry is second only to Chinas Bangladeshs economy has averaged more than 6 per cent annual growth for nearly a decade reaching 786 per cent in the year through JuneFrom mass starvation in 1974 the country has achieved near selfsufficiency in food production for its 166mplus population Per capita income has risen nearly threefold since 2009 reaching 1750 this year And the number of people living in extreme poverty classified as under 125 per day has shrunk from about 19 per cent of the population to less than 9 per cent over the same period according to the World BankEarlier this year Bangladesh celebrated a pivotal moment when it met UN criteria for graduating from least developed country status by 2024 To Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina the elevation to developing economy means a significant boost to the nations selfimageDespite its automation push Giant Group still employs thousands of workers  Akira KodakaExiting LDC status gives us some kind of strength and confidence which is very important not only for political leaders but also for the people she told the Nikkei Asian Review in an exclusive interview in December When you are in a low category naturally when you discuss terms of projects and programmes you must depend on others mercy But once you have graduated you dont have to depend on anyone because you have your own rightsMs Hasina says Bangladeshs strong economic growth will not just continue but accelerate In the next five years we expect annual growth to exceed 9 per cent and we hope get us to 10 per cent by 2021 she saidI always shoot for a higher rate she laughs Why should I predict lowerOn many fronts Bangladeshs economic performance has indeed exceeded even government targets With a national strategy focused on manufacturing dominated by the garment industry the country has seen exports soar by an average annual rate of 1517 per cent in recent years to reach a record 367bn in the year through June They are on track to meet the governments goal of 39bn in 2019 and Ms Hasina has urged industry to hit 50bn worth by 2021 to mark the 50th anniversary of what Bangladeshis call their Liberation WarA vast community of about 25m Bangladeshi overseas workers further buoys the economy with remittances that jumped an annual 18 per cent to top 15bn in 2018 But Ms Hasina also knows the country needs to move up the industrial value chain Political and business leaders echo her ambitions to shift from the old model of operating as a lowcost manufacturing hub partly dependent on remittances and international aidA shopping mall in Dhaka Bangladesh is on track to become a developing country in 2024  Akira KodakaTo that end Ms Hasina launched a Digital Bangladesh strategy in 2009 backed by generous incentives Now Dhaka the nations capital is home to a small but growing technology sector led by chief executives who talk boldly about leapfrogging neighbouring India in IT Pharmaceutical manufacturing another Indian staple is also on the riseThe government is now implementing an ambitious scheme to build a network of 100 special economic zones around the country 11 of which have been completed while 79 are under constructionThe concept neatly capitalises on Bangladeshs record population density leveraging what Faisal Ahmed chief economist at Bangladesh Bank calls the density dividend The proximity of our population also helped us design and spread social and economic ideas such as microfinance and lowcost healthcare But we need to better manage our scarce land resources and part of the answer is to develop wellfunctioning industrial parks and SEZs he saidThis article is from the Nikkei Asian Review a global publication with a uniquely Asian perspectives on politics the economy business and international affairs Our own correspondents and outside commentators from around the world share their views on Asia while our Asia300 section provides indepth coverage of 300 of the biggest and fastestgrowing listed companies from 11 economies outside JapanSubscribe  Group subscriptionsBehind the impressive numbers and bold ambitions however are daunting hurdles ranging from structural problems to deep political divisions which have come to the fore ahead of national elections on December 30Bangladeshi politics has been dominated for years by the bitter rivalry between Ms Hasina and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia whose family histories go back to opposing sides of the liberation struggle when Bangladesh was known as East Pakistan Both women have been in and out of power and prison over the past three decades Zia who chairs the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party is in jail on corruption charges that she says are falseSince 1981 Ms Hasina has led the ruling Awami League founded by her father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman the countrys first president who was killed by army personnel along with most of his family in 1975 The party enjoyed strong support in some past elections but opposition activists and human rights groups have voiced concern about potential polling fraud and intimidation tactics After two consecutive fiveyear terms for the ruling party analysts point to a palpable antiincumbency sentiment among some voters Yet from an economic standpoint many agree that a ruling party victory would support further developmentIf the polling passes without too much strife and the status quo is maintained then Bangladesh would seem an attractive longterm story said Christopher Wood managing director and chief strategist at Hong Kongbased brokerage CLSAGiant Group has introduced a high level of automation at its garment factories  Akira KodakaSpeaking at her official residence in central Dhaka the prime minister rejected local and international criticism of creeping authoritarianism Her party she insisted is committed to protecting democracy in BangladeshBusiness seems largely on the ruling partys side if only for stabilitys sake In recent interviews in Dhaka executives and political analysts dismissed suggestions that political turbulence could derail the countrys growth trajectoryWe feel relieved that all political parties are participating in the elections said Faruque Hassan managing director of Giant Group a leading garment manufacturer and senior vicepresident of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association We feel positive that despite political differences we can continue to keep economic issues separate although we know that without political stability you cant grow and you could scare international customersTailoring its industrial policyThe readymade garment industry is a key factor in the countrys phenomenal success story The industry is the countrys largest employer providing about 45m jobs and accounted for nearly 80 per cent of Bangladeshs total merchandise exports in 2018It has undergone seismic changes since the watershed Rana Plaza disaster in 2013 when a multistory garment factory complex collapsed killing more than 1130 workers In the aftermath the industry was forced by international apparel brands to implement sweeping reforms including factory upgrades inspections and improved worker conditionsA visit to one of Giant Groups gleaming factories brings home the industrys rapidly changing dynamics In a vast room a handful of workers oversees a fully automated operation that feeds fabric and thread into a huge machine that cuts stitches and turns out finished garments In another space nearby about 300 workers mostly women operate machines that embroider and add appliqu to garmentsAfter decades of turmoil Bangladesh has become South Asias fastestgrowing economy  Akira KodakaOur entire industry changed in just 90 seconds in April 2013 generally for the better said Mr Hassan of Giant We dont actually want 100 per cent automation hopefully we can offset the impact by shifting more workers into valueadded fields appliqu embroidery and so onFurther investment is needed if Bangladeshs garment industry is to remain competitiveBangladesh is still dominated by more basic products and cotton whereas growth worldwide has been in manmade fibres We need more investment in these areas not to produce more cotton shirts he saidBangladeshs textile industry could gain if Chinas garment exports are hit by a prolonged USChina trade war But other garment centres are also taking aim at a vulnerable China including Vietnam Turkey Myanmar and EthiopiaIntensifying international competition has already sparked consolidation in Bangladeshs garment industry reducing the number of factories by 22 per cent in the last five years to 4560 according to the BGMEACLSAs Mr Wood believes that Bangladeshs reliance on the garment sector is a potential obstacle to future growth This sector on a 10year view faces the risk of cheap wage alternatives such as Africa automation and the loss of dutyfree market access if Bangladesh transitions from LDC status as scheduled for 2024 he saidFor now the challenge is to develop other sectors with pharmaceuticals and business process outsourcing being two areas of promise But this will require much more foreign investment he saidFDI is not Bangladeshs strong point While it nearly tripled during Ms Hasinas nine years in office from 961m in fiscal 2008 to nearly 3bn in the year to June 30 this compares poorly with other Asian countries including Vietnam and MyanmarEmployees work at of Technohavens office in Dhaka  Akira KodakaGovernment officials partly blame the countrys consistently low rankings in the World Banks annual Ease of Doing Business survey which they fear deters foreign investors The latest survey issued in December put Bangladesh at 176th of 190 countries citing excessive red tape poor infrastructure and transportThe government has moved to streamline the investment process with the creation of a onestop investor service intended to replicate similar services in Singapore and Vietnam But this has yet to gain momentumMore successful is Ms Hasinas digital push With her son a USeducated tech expert as a key adviser the programme has introduced generous tax breaks for the information and communications technology sector and a sweeping scheme to build 12 hightech parks across the countryIn Dhaka a new generation of IT entrepreneurs talks about beating India which leapt on to the global map with its basic outsourcing industry by focusing on AI robotics and disruptive technologiesBangladeshs exports of software and IT services reached nearly 800m in the year to June 30 and are on track to exceed 1bn this fiscal year The governments target of reaching 5bn in ICTrelated exports by 2021 is very very challenging but achievable said Habibullah Karim chief executive of software company Technohaven and a cofounder of the Bangladesh Association of Software amp Information Services an industry bodyFrom 800m to 5bn is a sixfold increase in three years Thats tough in itself The second challenge is that the global outsourcing market is actually shrinking Mr Karim said Many tasks such as airline and hotel reservations and insurance claimsare now fully automatedThere have been outstanding homegrown tech successes such as ridesharing service Pathao which received a 2m investment from Indonesian unicorn GoJek and mobile financial services group bKash in which Alipay an arm of Chinas Alibaba Group Holding took a 20 per cent stake in AprilBut goahead industries badly need more financing said Khalid Quadir chief executive and cofounder of Brummer amp Partners Bangladesh which manages Frontier Fund the countrys only private equity fund He argues that innovation thrives on a strong private equity industry that can channel funds to promising companies and help them listWe have invested nearly 200m over the years in areas including communications infrastructure garments and pharmaceuticals Its a drop in the ocean compared to the growth opportunities on offer But to attract more capital of this kind regulation could be more investorfriendly he said citing threeyear lockup provisions on investments in newly listed companiesShameem Ahsan chairman of IT company eGeneration and a former head of BASIS sees Bangladeshs tech niche at the cutting edge of IT Forty years ago the garment industry started with a few companies Now Bangladesh is exporting 30bnplus worth and is second only to China We want to do the same thing in the IT industry he saidBangladesh is hoping to challenge India in pharmaceuticals too With its least developed country status the country has enjoyed a waiver on drug patents This has fuelled intensifying competition between India and Bangladesh in the field of generic and bulk drugs Among local star performers is Incepta Pharmaceuticals Bangladeshs secondlargest generics maker which exports to about 60 countries and Popular Pharmaceuticals which is eyeing an eventual listingWhen you look at US and Europetheir manufacturing plants are closing and they are coming to Asia Why Because of quality affordable drugs said Syed Billah senior general manager at Incepta We have the quality and recognition from international regulatory bodies and are very good at finished products But in bulk drugs we are far behind and seeking technology for that from ChinaOne of Bangladeshs competitive disadvantages is its poor infrastructure and the country has turned to China for help Under its Belt and Road Initiative China has financed various megaprojects in Bangladesh including most of the nearly 4bn Padma Bridge rail link which will connect the countrys southwest with the northern and eastern regions In all China has committed 38bn in loans aid and other assistance for BangladeshChinas heavy infrastructure investment has drawn criticism of its debt diplomacy in other countries including Pakistan and Sri Lanka But local economists dismiss such concernsI dont think Bangladesh is being pulled too far into Chinas orbit like Pakistan or even Sri Lanka said Faiz Sobhan senior director of research at the Bangladesh Enterprise Institute an independent thinktank noting that the country is also reliant on Japanese infrastructure investmentMs Hasina said the government is taking a more proactive role in the financing alongside international partners such as China Japan and international financial institutions We have undertaken to establish our own sovereign wealth fund worth 10bn to bankroll longterm physical infrastructure development This is possible because our foreign exchange reserves stand at more than 32bn now from 75bn 10 years agoChinese investors also bought 25 per cent of the Dhaka Stock Exchange in 2018 and Bangladesh is now the secondlargest importer of Chinese military hardware after PakistanWhile some may question so much investment from Beijing Ms Hasina said it is simply a fact that China is set to play a bigger role in the regionOur foreign policy is very clear friendly relations with everyone she said What China and US are doing it is between themAdditional reporting by

problem If sizing up the middle class is difficult enough its even harder to say that circumstances within this group have changed But they certainly have As youll discover in this Fortune special report life has gotten more difficult for the millions of people within the middle class We dispatched more than 50 people to discover why the American dream has been fading for far too manyIn this section we ask some of the sharpest minds for their ideas on how to fix it What we learned Chasing the American dream was once exhilarating now its exhaustingRaise Wages Or Should WeIf the big problem with lowwage jobs is that they dont pay enough to live on the answer seems obvious Mandate wage raises Many local governments such as Chicago and Oakland and Seattle have done just thatin Amazons hometown the minimum wage will rise to 15 by 2021 well above the federal minimum wage of 725 an hour Some corporations grappling with a shortage of employees are following suit In October Amazon said it would raise its minimum hourly wage to 15 nationwide At Walmart its 11 the result of three hikes since 2015 for its 13 million US workers Target has pledged to lift starting wages to 15 by 2020But is it helping workers The answer iscomplicated A number of new studies released last fall show a decidedly mixed picture In California a team from UCLA studied the restaurant industry and found that when the minimum wage was gradually bumped up to 8 in 2008 earnings rose more than 10 at fastfood chains but employment fell by about 12 Another move this time up to 1050 in 2017 lifted earnings 20 but employment fell another 10 And a group of University of Washington researchers found earlier this year that the net effect of a twopart minimumwage increase in Seattle was fewer hours effectively meaning that lowwage workers brought home 125 less per month with the hit to their pocketbook much more pronounced on the second increase By contrast a UCBerkeley study looking at seven US cities that had implemented higher minimum wages found a benefit to wages with little effect on employment levelsTheres little question that as wages rise companies are redoubling efforts to automate Target CVS

household income for their state In New Hampshire theyre paid just 100 a year It means only the wealthy can afford such posts Then they trickle up into higher office A 2014 analysis by Peverill Squire a political science professor at the University of Missouri who has studied American legislator pay back to 1619 determined that the best way to align elected officials interests with the publics is to tie state legislators salaries to the states median household income In 2018 he found median nationwide income for state legislators was 32611 despite a national median household income of 59039Voters think they save money by keeping salaries low But it actually guarantees theyll be ruled by the rich who tend to legislate by lining their own pockets and ignoring or even hurting those

1990s there was a bipartisan effort called Welfare to Work I had the opportunity to be on the Presidents board In a fullemployment economy companiesand I think this is a best practice that has been completely forgotten for some reasonmade a pledge to move former welfare recipients to work We learned that the public sector couldnt do it on its own that the private sector was the creator of jobs So every company that signed up for the Welfare to Work partnership received tax breaks for getting people to work because you had to deal with education transportation childcare The government subsidized the companies to create the jobsI personally think that we need another cooperative between the public and private sectors to deal with things like retooling and reskilling the workforce If people are working but its not meaningful work they feel left behind Even if they do get a paycheck its a modest paycheck But they feel that theyre not on the cutting edge of the new economy not in

rates in certain areas of Pittsburgh because people dont have access to transportation so they cant seek jobs These singlefamily households these underserved and underprivilegedthey dont have access to these opportunities That obviously has a profound impact on the economics of the communityThe university reached out to Dara Khosrowshahi Ubers CEO and talked to Uber about a model where the

moment in the spotlight when Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders extolled the nations accomplishments for working people Rival Hillary Clinton shot back We are not DenmarkNo but with the fourthworst poverty rate in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development it may be worth looking at what Denmark with the lowest rate of poverty among wealthy nations is doing While its obvious that a hightax highbenefit comprehensive welfare state is excellent at eradicating true poverty whats interesting about Denmark is that spending is not reserved for just the poorest The middle class also benefits says Michael Frster an OECD senior policy analyst Indeed Denmark directs more social spending toward workingage people than any other OECD countryWhat does that look like exactly All told 98 of households with children 15 and under in Denmark receive financial assistance And thats just the beginning Other benefits that fall to the middle class include free college tuition and health care jobtraining as well as a robust system of subsidized childcare Students over 18 who live on their own receive a monthly subsidy of around 933 even those living with their parents receive 145 Danish corporations utilize a model known as Flexicuritywhen layoffs are necessary a system of training and job assistance kicks in Denmarks system then is more like a safety harness The goal is to prevent people from falling into poverty in the first place In that sense were certainly not Denmark but perhaps its time to reconsider whether our safety net approach is enough By Claire ZillmanPramila Jayapal Thinks We All Need To Do Better By WorkersToo many pundits and economists want to join the White House in saying that our economy is strong because unemployment is down and GDP is growing But the 89 million Americans who work fulltime and still live in poverty certainly dont think the economy is booming Neither do the 40 of Americans who struggle to meet a basic need such as buying food or covering rent or the 62 who dont even have 1000 in their savings account for an emergencyThe fact is GDP growth means nothing when 90 of it goes to the top 1 as is true today And while unemployment is low wage growth has been stubbornly slow and not keeping pace with inflation Its past time that we acknowledge a simple truth an economy in which workers dont benefit from the profits they help produce isnt strongits brokenCongress needs to take action to restore the power imbalance between workers and employers First Congress should pass the Raise the Wage bill and immediately lift wages for 41 million workers The bill would raise the minimum wage to 15 an hour and index it to growth in the median wage Because of government inaction the real value of the minimum wage has steadily eroded for decades and is now 25 lower than it was at its inflationadjusted peak in 1968 Poverty rates for AfricanAmericans and Hispanics in particular would be almost 20 lower if the minimum wage had kept up with inflationSecond Congress can restore the broken link between corporate profits and wages by putting a stop to the growing practice of corporate executives handing their profits to shareholders rather than to workers Before the Securities and Exchange Commission made it easier for companies to buy back their stock in 1982 SampP 500 companies spent only about 2 of their profits on buybacks Last year those same companies spent 59 of their profits on buybacks Congress should pass the Reward Work bill which could result in billions of dollars in increased wages by putting a stop to openmarket stock buybacks and ensure that workers have a seat at the table to fight for their fair share of the value they createThe American people are demanding this as well This past election brought a historic wave of the most diverse candidates from red and blue districts across the country sent to fight for the people They dont want a handout They just want us to even the playing field and give them a fair shot Democrats control only one legislative body but this is the moment for us to put forward a bold vision and stand up to the biggest corporate interests that stand in the way of ensuring that we all move forwardtogether By Pramila JayapalMarco Rubio Believes Business Can Do BetterBut So Can GovernmentFor too long Washington and New York have presented American workers with a false choice economic growth for the few with redistribution or economic growth for the few without redistribution Neither framework results in an economy in which regular Americans can provide for a family with their own labor They deserve a different optionMy parents came to this country as immigrants and built lives worthy of the American dream But since I was born in the 1970s the share of men between ages 25 and 34 earning less than 30000 a year has almost doubled Like my father most of these men do not have an education beyond the equivalent of a high school degree My mother worked most of her life as a maid a profession with a median annual income of less than 23000The solution cannot be simply to get a degree or retrain every time a job is outsourced or eliminated Workers are not machines that can be broken down upgraded reassembled and shipped across the country to the next area of high demand They are moms and dads who pay rent with kids who have friends in their schools and on sports teams and grandparents or family nearby Building a life is as much about stability as it is about payThe solution also cannot be a new round of government checks designed to buy off the financial security of the working poor Work is about creating value Theres a connection between the dirty shirt or aching feet at the end of the day and the paycheck that fulfills a deeply human need for purposeThe kind of stability that comes from a good job is only truly possible when Americans work for productive businesses that grow innovate and invest Part of what our country lacks is a consensus on how to create more of these stable and highpaying jobs While the work of developing one is just beginning some general goals are clear more corporate investment in products and RampD over financial engineering a more balanced system of international trade that makes the US the unquestioned home of nextgeneration technologies and a more profamily system of social insurance While not all of these require government solutions some policies I have proposed will help Expanding the immediate deduction for capital expenses from the 2017 tax law pursuing a strategy to compete directly with the Made in China 2025 industrial plan and passing national paid parental leave and an expanded child tax credit are all projects that I will continue to dedicate my time toThere is no economic future for American workers without productive businesses It should be the work of politicians and businesses alike to build an economy that boldly creates the American products and jobs of the 21st century By Marco RubioChuck RobbinsCEO CiscoThose who are completely destitute and those who work fulltime still need the same thing housing they can afford Our country is facing

How Can We Reignite The American DreamJames ZiliakProfessor of Economics University of Kentucky Focus on Childcare says Ziliak Its price has skyrocketed outpaced only by the cost of higher education in recent yearsoutofpocket childcare consumes on average 16 and up to 25 of incomesand its a major reason behind the nations declining labor participation rates says Ziliak He proposes overhauling the childcare tax credit limiting eligibility to families with incomes below 70000 and making the credit refundable and more generous The idea got attention from the Obama administration and a handful of senators but never made it out of committeeJeffrey SachsProfessor of Sustainable Development Columbia University Health care must be a priority says Sachs We could emulate Canada or Australia by adopting a singlepayer system Sachs also recommends empowering workers to organize providing better schooltowork transition programs eg Germanys apprenticeship model and overhauling the economics of higher education so they dont constrain the choices of future workers He advocates a 21stcentury land grant program that would slash the cost of education Also on his list a wealth tax and a serious infrastructure program that would equip the labor force with new skills and jobsEsther DufloProfessor of Economics MIT Follow the data Duflo has shaken up the economics world with a radical premise Aid programs should be tested and evaluated with the same rigor as prescription drugs through randomized controlled trials She thinks we could see big gains by taking small steps to stop the poor from falling through the existing safety net Many schoolchildren missed out on free lunch programs until the Bush and Obama administrations simplified the signup process she explains The same could be done for food stamps and disability benefits which are often overly complicated to accessPhotos Ziliak Courtesy of Ziliak Sachs The Oxford UnionShutterstock Duflo Peter TenzerAddress This Gulf Before It Keeps GrowingShe wrote the book on working povertyliterally Barbara Ehrenreichs Nickel and Dimed On Not Getting By in America gave many middle and uppermiddleclass Americans their first raw glimpse of what its like to survive on the wages of a waitress sales clerk maid or other lowpaying job in various statesSince the books publication in 2001 a lot has changed including how Ehrenreich tells the stories of those in poverty As a journalist in the 80s and 90s she felt like a respected part of the middle class making a comfortable living to support her family Thats changed At a certain point around 2009 I realized that I could keep doing this only because I had savings from the royalties of the book Nickel and Dimed and I thought Okay thats wonderful I can do this Then I said Wait a minute What am I saying You have to be rich to write about poverty Thats sickIndeed in the past two decades shes seen the stress and uncertainty that dogged hourly workers 20 years ago spread Things got worse both for the socalled middle class but also for lots of other people working in lowerwage jobs she says One of the strikingly bad developments is the rise of justintime employment where you just wait and get a call from your boss to come in So you dont know from one day to the next what youre going to be earningThough she cites some improvements here and there more access to health care movements to raise the minimum wage shes worriedboth by street protests in countries like France and by the increase in anger toward immigrants all over As she puts it people dont always act rationally when they see their own life chances diminishingMore and more she says the economic choices of the few have left a huge swath of Americans living with a tremendous amount of anxiety And its not just maids and hourly workers she warns Its contract workers shift workers teachers Uber drivers smallbusiness owners the middle class It might even be youBy Lisa Marie SegarraA version of this

But the president’s approach of attacks on the Fed is likely to just make the markets worse.,https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-volatility-only-adds-to-stock-market-selling-pressure-11545830875,2018-12-26 14:43:34,Its not a shock that an epic bull market fueled by years of exceptionally easy money should stumble as that monetary stimulus is withdrawn Its too soon to know the final fallout but not too soon to see that President Trump is probably making it worseThe Federal Reserves decision to raise interest rates last week to between 225 and 25 was widely expected Nonetheless an intensifying stock selloff has fueled criticism that the move was a mistakeSome critics argue that even such low interest rates may be too high because growth and inflation are being held back by shortfall in demand due to low productivity growth and an aging population Harvard University economist Larry Summers the most prominent advocate of this view has criticized Fed tightening since it began in 2015 and now puts the probability of recession by the end of 2020 at more than 50This view is economically plausible butlostadherents in the past year as economic growth investment and productivity picked up Indeed supporters of Mr Trump claim his policies in particular a broad tax cut have lifted sustained US growth to 3 compared with below 2 the consensus of independent economistsParadoxically many of these same advocates seem worriedtodays low interest rates are high enough toundermine growth those two views are mutually exclusiveAnother critique comes from market participants such as former Fed governor Kevin Warsh who believe the Fed is ignoring troubling signals from the financial marketsOne problem with this critique is that it contradicts prior advice from many of these same people Mr Warsh has long accused the Fed of worrying too much about asset prices and called on it to reverse its stimulus even when unemployment was over 6 and inflation below the Feds 2 target Today unemployment is below 4 and inflation close to target for the Fed to pause now would be to prioritize asset prices over the economy precisely the opposite of what it is supposed to doNonetheless these critics could be right if for example the markets were signaling a breakdown in the functioning of the financial system as in 2008 when the mortgage market imploded and major banks nearly failed So far there is no such evidence That is why Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchins announcement Sunday that banks had plenty of liquidity mystified and worried market participants The critics will also be right if economic data take a sharp turn for the worse in coming months or a financial crisis erupts in the US or abroad Fed officials know theyre fallible and in such a circumstance would quickly signal a shift toward easier monetary policy and prepare crisismanagement measuresFed Chairman Jerome Powell was picked for the job in part for such flexibility He was less wedded to tighter monetary policy than some candidates including Mr Warsh and his views on the financial system meshed with Mr MnuchinsBut this is where Mr Trump is making matters worse Previous presidents accepted the stock market was out of their hands and sought instead to emphasize the economys sound fundamentals and stable policy making Mr Trump has done the opposite He is engaged in a trade standoff with China that he boasts has hurt that countrys growth he has fomented chaos on foreign policy by triggering the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and he provoked a partial government shutdown in hopes of securing funding for a border wall His attacks on the Fed compound the uncertainty and turmoil at the top echelons of federal policy making Mr Powell has promised that such attacks wont affect his or his colleagues decisions But as Mr Trumps political acolytes pile on the attacks taint the independent central banks actions with politics Investors may increasingly speculate that Fed policy on interest rates rather than being guided solely by economic data may be influenced by the desire to appease or defy Mr TrumpIf Mr Trump tries to fire Mr Powell as he has reportedly explored the chaos would be magnitudes worse Such a move could trigger litigation and a constitutional crisis since by law a Fed governor including its chairman can only be fired for causeEven if Mr Trump succeeds in naming someone else as chairman of the Feds board of governors its ratesetting Federal Open Market Committee made up of Senateconfirmed governors and independent reservebank presidents could choose someone else as its chairman Either way monetary policy would become unpredictable and politicizedThe harm would be even greater should a genuine crisis erupt such as a financial institution getting into trouble or a country threatening to default on its debts The Fed has coordinated its response to similar events in the past with the Treasury and White House it may be less able to now for fear of the fact or perception of political pressure and because so many key Treasury positions are vacantMr Trump wants to blame the bear market on the Fed Odds are historians will blame it on himWrite to Greg Ip at gregipwsjcom

entrepreneur is rethinking a way of doing business that hasnt changed much in more than a century His company CSC Generation purchased BonTons intellectual property for 900000 in September and plans to invest an additional 5 millionFirst came relaunched websites under its seven nameplatesBonTon Bergners Boston Store Carsons ElderBeerman Herbergers and YounkersThen on Black Friday a bricksandmortar Carsons opened on the site of a previous Carsons store at the Evergreen Plaza shopping center in a suburb of Chicago one of eight leases that Mr Yoshimura has signed The next Carsons is scheduled to open in Orland Park Ill in February While many mall owners have been nudging out department stores and replacing them with new tenants such as sportinggoods chains and supermarkets Lormax Stern Development Co the owner of Evergreen Plaza welcomed Carsons back The store had been on track to hit 25 million in annual sales before it closed in September a sign it was still a draw for the community according to Chris Brochert a Lormax founding partnerDepartment stores have a future because they offer onestop shopping Mr Brochert saidThe new Carsons store is similar enough to its predecessor to win back loyal customers who can still find their Ugg boots and Tahari dresses But it is also different in important ways The twostory store already had shrunk to 120000 square feet from 250000 square feet during a 2016 reconstruction CSC Generation converted the top floor to a warehouse for ecommerce orders below is 30000 square feet of retail space which eventually will expand to 60000 square feet about a quarter of the size of a typical department storeDepartment stores used to sell everything under the sun so the bigger the store the better the 28yearold Mr Yoshimura said But today how can you have more products than AmazonMr Yoshimura and his team which includes former BonTon executives are digging through 100 terabytes of customer data to figure out what people really want to buy at a department store Out went items that werent selling such as apparel the category has been reduced by 50 The furniture and toy departments have been expanded and the retailer will soon add large appliances to its lineup Also coming soon an art gallery hair salon and bakeryInstead of restocking once a season the store receives fresh items daily and changes over all its merchandise every two weeks That is a result of Mr Yoshimuras push to strike deals with Asian factories that ship directly and brands that produce domestically to shorten delivery times Carsons recently offered to buy specialty womens apparel retailerChristopher amp Banks Corp which said last week that its board had rejected the unsolicited proposal Retail margins have been eroding but Mr Yoshimura plans to counter that trend by selling services such as auto insurance Customers are asked at the checkout if they are interested in switching to one of several providers that CSC Generation has deals with in return for a 10 discount on all future Carsons purchases CSC gets a fee for every referral Mr Yoshimura said 8 of customers say they are interested in switchingHe said retailers are too focused on outdated measures such as samestore sales We dont care about those metrics he said We care about the store being a billboard for our digital business Its a way for customers to experience our brandPerhaps the biggest difference is the stores hours It is closed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays Mr Yoshimura said the fiveday week will allow him to hire only fulltime employees and

described by Hasbro Inc. executives as setting a new tone.,http://fortune.com/2018/12/22/hasbro-transformers-movie/,2018-12-22 21:00:12,Bumblebeethe sixth Transformers movie in 11 yearshas been described by Hasbro Inc executives as setting a new tone one that will reinvigorate its fan base with a heartfelt story thats our most allfamily allaudience dualgender film everIn a first for the franchise a woman Christina Hodson wrote the screenplay for the movie which hits US theaters on Friday It also boasts the first female lead for the series 22yearold Hailee Steinfeld Director Travis Knight made a name for himself in stopmotion animated kids films such as the critically acclaimed Coraline As for Bumblebee a black and yellow robot he transforms into a Volkswagen Beetle a cuddlier disguise than the brawny Chevy Camaro he inhabited in the previous five filmsHes everybodys buddy Tom Warner Hasbros senior vice president for the Transformers franchise said of the character You are going to see more heart and soul and fun in this film than ever beforeThis may be a tall order given the franchises reputation Derided as a cynical exercise in advertising masquerading as feature film the movies are regularly pilloried for their tweenboy feverdream plots about battling robotsIn promotional materials for Bumblebee Knightthe son of Nike Inc founder Phil Knightsaid growing up in the 1980s made him love those classic Spielbergian comingofage tales and that he wanted to bring the same sensibility to Transformers Its no surprise that the trailer feels a lot like ET with a sympathetic and endangered alien a robot in this case looking to a young Earthling Steinfeld for help In a review Rolling Stone summed it up as if John Hughes made a Transformers movieIts fair to ask how such a film could fit with the testosteronepumping summer tentpole franchise that generated almost 5 billion in inflationadjusted global box office One that Variety called a crunchedmetal robotwar megaseriesThe answer is that it doesnt Call it a reboot of a reboot Bumblebee is a prequel to the entire 11yearold franchise Its set in the 1980s which coincidentally is when Hasbro shook up the toy industry with the Transformers television show an animated series that spawned hundreds of millions of dollars in merchandise sales The new movie tells the origin story of Bumblebee who was a Volkswagen bug in the original cartoon tooWe deliberately wanted to open it up and go back to the roots said Hasbros Warner who joined the company in 2014 after a career at Hollywood studios including 20th Century Fox To bring the fun back to TransformersIts a daring move for the company considering what the previous films accomplished They may not have drawn many laughs or positive reviews but when viewed strictly as a marketing device action figures pajamas pillow cases lunch boxes the franchise is a moneymaking phenomenon If theres a Mount Rushmore of film merchandising the Transformers series is on it right next to Star Wars Frozen and MarvelWhen the first installment simply dubbed Transformers hit theaters on July 3 2007 the property had been pretty much dead for a decade Hasbro sought to recapture the brands success on the small screen where it hooked latchkey kids with an afterschool cartoon about a war between good and bad robots from a distant world called Cybertron Some say the brand might have peaked as early as 1986 with an early animated feature filmThe Transformers The Moviethat had Weird Al Yankovic on the soundtrack and Orson Welles voicing a robot that could devour entire planetsBut the 2007 movie changed everything It was a smash racking up an inflationadjusted 855 million at the global box office The liveaction film starring Shia LaBeouf and directed by actionfilm stalwart Michael Bay even had buyin from Steven Spielberg who signed on as executive producer Not only did it thrill young boys and their nostalgic parents but the movie landed struggling Hasbro a new gigantic revenue stream that would surpass halfabillion dollars a yearThe toy industry and its relationship with Hollywood was forever altered by Transformers Older toy brands and their valuable builtin audiencesmany having become parentswere seen as potential boxoffice cash cows Look at what Lego has done with plastic blocks Properties once seen as dead or dormant suddenly looked ripe for revival Cue the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles rebootThe franchise was the brainchild of Brian Goldner 55 who got promoted from chief operating officer to Hasbros top job within a year The success of Transformers gave him the power and freedom to steer the company away from just being a maker of molded plastic Hes since taken GI Joe My Little Pony and the game Battleship to the big screen The company which has considered merging with a movie studio now calls itself a global play and entertainment company replete with its own television and film production divisionsFollowing the 2007 blockbuster Transformers fell into a bankable formula Hasbros Hollywood partner Paramount Pictures made and marketed the films and reaped the box office cash Bay kept stuffing the franchise with CGI violence and increasingly absurd plots Hasbro chalked up the bigscreen use of its intellectual property to free marketing and Goldner got executive producer credits The prospect of a coming movieand all that brand awareness from Paramounts massive ad spenddrove retailers such as Walmart Inc and Target Corp to keep stocking shelves with Transformers merchandise And the fans dutifully gobbled it upThat critics skewered the films didnt seem to matter because audiences kept coming This was especially the case in China where Transformers Revenge of the Fallen in 2009 Transformers Dark of the Moon in 2011 and Transformers Age of Extinction in 2014 struck gold The latest of these three movies also marked the handoff from LaBeouf to Mark Wahlberg as the human face of the franchiseGoldner used the Transformers template to turn other toy lines into entertainment brands My Little Ponyanother forgotten 1980s propertybecame My Little Pony The Movie in 2017 By then Hasbros market value had almost tripled since the 2007 Transformers film was released topping 14 billion The 95yearold company founded in Providence Rhode Island by Henry Hillel and Herman Hassenfeld as a seller of textile remnants and school supplies leapfrogged Mattel Inc to become the most valuable toymaker in the worldBut then Hasbro went too far Transformers The Last Knight which debuted on June 21 2017 took the series in a strange direction Hasbro and Paramount wanted to expand the franchise just as Disney did with Marvel by creating multiple spinoffs and serials that are somehow all connected to a broader cinematic universe They founded a writers room and even tapped an Academy Awardwinning scribe Akiva Goldsman writer of A Beautiful Mind Like Marvel they turned to decades of comic books and mythology that had sprung up around the original seriesThere is so much lore to pull from said Samantha Lomow president of Hasbro brands There is Earth but there is Cybertron and everything in between There are hundreds and hundreds of Transformers characters Weve just scratched the surfaceLast Knight told the story of Transformers who were around to help King Arthur and asserted that Earth is actually Unicron the planeteating robot Welles played in the 1986 animated film Critics were especially harsh this time butmore important for Hasbrofans stayed away too The US box office tally of 130 million was the worst of the series by almost 50 percentMeanwhile the timing was also bad Last Knight opened between Cars 3 and Despicable Me 3 causing it to be quickly overshadowedUS movie attendance tumbled There was already a growing sense that Hollywood was overloading audiences with sequels spinoffs and rebootsall at a time when Netflix Inc and Amazoncom Inc have been inundating them at home Kids have so much content coming at them that movies dont resonate like they used to said Gerrick Johnson an analyst for BMO Capital Markets who covers the toy industryAnd as poorly as Last Knight did in the box office Johnson had additional bad news for Hasbro Toys tied to movies have been underperforming he saidRight now most of the bestselling toys and topperforming toy companies have almost no connection to Hollywood For example privatelyheld MGA Entertainments hit brand LOL Surprise was inspired by YouTube unboxing videos Dont make us explain Thats especially troubling for Hasbro because its embraced movie tieins like no other toy companyAnd it gets worse Not only does Hasbro depend on its own films doing well to move merchandise it also has a slew of licensing deals with other franchises including Walt Disney Cos Star Wars and Marvel A weakening movie market coupled with the liquidation of major customer Toys R Us earlier this year has helped knock Hasbros shares down 24 percent in the past 18 monthsHasbro has decided to put more skin in the film game inking a new deal with Paramount that expands its financial stake both in helping fund production and getting a portion of revenue With Bumblebee it hopes to turn the corner even faster In the aftermath of Last Knight it put another Baydirected Transformers film on hold while pushing Bumblebee to Christmas where it could help draw a broader more female audience The last two Transformers movies skewed about 60 percent male according to ComScoreThis last move is why Goldner was so excited to explain to investors in October that Bumblebee will be Hasbros most dualgender film By making the story about a gutsy young heroine its following a path taken by other megafranchises that have tried to attract more girls Just look at what the latest Star Wars films did with female leads with characters such as Rey and Jyn Erso and the success Warner Bros DC Comics had with Wonder WomanStill there are pitfalls Johnson the BMO analyst said some Transformers fans might not like the new tone And after a decade changing the perception that the franchise offers anything more than battling robots will be difficultBut Hasbro is betting Bumblebee will tap millions of Generation X dads out theredads such as Daniel PickettThe 47yearold who works in marketing and helps run a toy news website called Action Figure Insider is a devotee of the original animated television series Hes barely paid attention to the latest Transformers movies and has never considered taking his teenage daughter to oneuntil now They were so boycentric Pickett said Just filled with two pieces of tinfoil fighting I see all the Star Wars films with my wife and daughter and I never would have thought to take them to a Transformers movie before this

markets around the world with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index ending the year down more than 16 per cent and the MSCI World Index off more than 10 per cent While many economists are projecting global growth to slow further in 2019 and 2020 some firms expect emerging economies to get back on track and outperform the US if China and the US reach a trade deal As always the global picture is nuanced so the Financial Post spoke with AGF Investments vicepresident Regina Chi who manages the firms emerging markets fund and Fiera Capital global asset allocation portfolio manager Nicolas Vaugeois who oversees the multistrategy income fund about the countries they think are poised to be winners and losers for 2019The goodBrazilThe Brazilian market boomed with the election of farright President Jair Bolsonaro and Vaugeois sees continued opportunities for investors in 2019 Vaugeois is betting on a spike in commodities prices  both in minerals and oil  next year About 17 per cent of Brazils economy is weighted towards materials If prices of iron ore which make up 74 per cent of Brazilian exports increase investors could capitalize by buying mining stocks A spike in oil prices could have a similar impact on the countrys oil producers Vaugeois said Brent crude prices are hovering below US60 but if they increase to between US60 and US65 oil producer Petrobras would likely be the main benefactor he saidChinaChinas trade war with the US is expected to reach an amicable conclusion in 2019 and that would result in a rally for its market both Chi and Vaugeois agreed The government has worked to earn back the confidence of investors by stimulating the economy offering cuts to VAT corporate and personal taxes and by investing US900 billion in a new infrastructure program which encompasses several light rail and subway projects Chi recommends CRRC Corporation Limited the countrys largest locomotive and light rail train manufacturer as it stands to benefit most from these projects Should the trade war drag on the Peoples Bank of China has shown a willingness to offer massive interest rate cuts that may be enough to convince investors to reenter the market she saidThailandThailand has been under military rule for the past five years but its citizens are set to go to the polls in February to elect a new government A democraticallyelected government should immediately bring back skittish investors and attract foreign investments Chi said The country is rapidly moving away from being exportdependent and is instead turning its focus inward with the development of its Eastern Economic Corridor  an ambitious 50 billion project that aims to transform 13000 kilometres of land over three provinces into a hub for several techbased industries including robotics and nextgen automotive The junta has already laid down the groundwork for the EEC with land ownership and tax laws but the momentum is really going to take off after the election Chi said The development of the corridor will result in significant infrastructure projects and the banking sector is the best way to play infrastructure lending through corporate loans said Chi recommending KasikornbankUnited Arab EmiratesAfter years of suffering from steep declines in the price of Brent crude which fell to around US30 in 2015 the UAE was able to gain some momentum in 2018 as prices rebounded making it once again an attractive target for investors With a market trading at a projected priceearnings multiple of just 85 times for 2019 it is a remarkably cheap target too Chi said If investors are buying in here they should be doing so in a way that gives them exposure to the countrys strengthening recovery which will see GDP growth hit 33 per cent in 2019 compared to less than one per cent in 2018 The best way to do that is to once again look to the banking sector said Chi who recommends the First Abu Dhabi Bank Such a move would also give investors the ability to capitalize on the countrys improvement in the fixed income market due to a widening spread for loans she saidThe badArgentinaThe Argentine peso lost 51 per cent of its value in comparison to the US dollar in 2018 making it the worst performing currency of the year and that should be enough to convince investors to stay at armslength As part of a US56 billion bailout provided by the International Monetary Fund a currency band was placed on Argentina that will see it trade between 36 pesos and 46 pesos per dollar This proves the point that country matters because you could have a good highquality company in Argentina but you have a currency down 50 per cent Chi said That stock would be down 50 per cent just due to the currency exposure Vaugeois however said Argentina could be a good surprise for fixedincome investors as the threeyear government bonds are yielding a healthy 95 per centIndiaWhile many investors are high on India because its GDP growth is expected to balloon to 73 per cent in 2019 from 67 per cent in 2018 Chi isnt convinced Like the UAE Indias performance is tied to oil prices and Chi suggests India is very lucky that Brent crude prices are hovering around US57 because theyre net importers If prices rise their luck may run out she said For Prime Minister Narendra Modi that already appears to be the case as his BJP party lost three states in state elections With a federal election upcoming in 2019 Modi is losing momentum and if he loses it would bring uncertainty and disruption to the markets The Dec 10 resignation of central banker Urjit Patel for personal reasons is another factor clouding the outlook thereMexicoThe Mexican market has been one of the worst global performers this year and newlyelected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador isnt helping The leftwing politician campaigned on businessfriendly views pushing goals of stabilizing the economy and attracting foreign investment as his advisors met with fund managers Postelection his views have changed rapidly and hes made it clear that Mexicos citizens not the market are his main concern He only cares for his people especially the poor which is great but it is causing disruption in the markets Chi said Lopez Obradorcancelled a US13 billion airport project in Mexico City in October after holding referendums that did not have wide participation In announcing the cancellation he said that Mexico was bankrupt which only served to further spook investors Under fire the president haspromised to commit to the safety of future investments and to create conditions for good returns but Chi is remaining pessimistic until she sees actionRussiaInvestors in Russia have suffered under the weight of international sanctions and a further incident in the Black Sea in November in which Russia shot at and seized three Ukrainian ships and their crews may only make things worse For Fieras Vaugeois the risk that further sanctions could derail both the equities and fixedincome markets is enough to make Russia an unappealing target for investment The banking sector in particular is at risk given the US Treasury Departments history of targeting banks as recently as August Further sanctions Vaugeois said would likely also result in sharp declines for investors holding Russian ruble treasury bonds which declined 65 per cent in value during the Ukraine crisis in 2014

development comes amid media speculation that Trump could ditch Pence in favor of another running mateTrump has told confidants that he wants Pence to be his running mate in the next election and the vice president has privately told him hes ready to defend the administration against a Democratic onslaughtPresident Donald Trump has been telling his closest political advisors in recent weeks that he wants Vice President Mike Pence to be with him on the ticket in 2020 CNBC has learnedThe development comes amid media speculation that Trump could ditch Pence in favor of another running mateTrump has told confidants that he wants Pence to be his running mate in the next election and the vice president has privately told him hes ready to defend the administration against a likely onslaught of Democratic presidential candidates running to replace them according to three people with direct knowledge of the matterDuring a November press conference Trump himself asked Pence if he would be his running mate The former Indiana governor nodded his head However since then Vanity Fair reported that Trump was thinking about ditching PenceThe latest news might not end the speculation about Pences fate though since Trump is known to change his mind without notice as his recent search for a new chief of staff demonstratedTrump announced last week that Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney will take over as acting chief of staff after he said John Kelly would leave at the end of the year Kelly had earlier agreed to stay in the role until 2020 Trumps decision to pick Mulvaney concluded an exhaustive search with others such as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and former New Jersey Gov Chris Christie under consideration Neither Mnuchin nor Christie were interested in taking the jobWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and a spokeswoman for Pence did not return repeated requests for commentPences continued presence on the Trump ticket could be critical to preserving the presidents connections to conservative and Evangelical Christians The vice president a bornagain Christian and a former member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus helped Trump garner 80 percent of the white evangelical electorate during the 2016 presidential election the highest level since 2004 when George W Bush received their overwhelming backingPence and the administrations connection to the evangelical community was evident when he spoke at the annual Southern Baptist Convention in Dallas in June At the event he told a large gathering of 10000 pastors that the Trump White House would continue to defend their religions prioritiesThis is a pivotal year in the life of our nation Pence said at the time Be assured of this President Trump and I are going to continue to fight for what we know is rightOverall the Southern Baptist denomination boasts 15 million membersTrump has surrounded himself with conservative Christian leaders to advise him on policies that appeal to the GOPs evangelical base Trump has sought counsel from minister Jerry Falwell Jr and Southern Baptist pastor Robert JeffressAnother asset Pence brings to the table fundraising chopsThe vice president has his own political and fundraising operation in place to help Trumps reelection bid Pences political action committee the Great America Committee has raised over 4 million throughout the 2018 election cycle but spent most of it during the midtermsTrump on the other hand has brought in over 100 million combined between his own campaign and the joint fundraising committees that also contribute to the Republican National CommitteeThe combined TrumpPence fundraising effort will be a tough match for any Democrat even ones who end up snagging the backing of major

21:14:30,Italys deal with the European Union to defuse its simmering budget dispute is adding to concerns about the countrys real economic problem a lack of growthBy reining in its spending plans under pressure from financial markets and the EUs Brusselsbased executive the European Commission Rome has avoided EU disciplinary proceedings for now But Italys antiestablishment government is also left with few policy plans for boosting growth in a stagnant economyThe governing coalition of two selfdescribed populist parties the anticorruption 5 Star Movement and the antiimmigration League vowed to stimulate growth next year by putting more money in the pockets of the Italians as League leader Matteo Salvini put itThe European Commission said the plans broke EU rules on deficitreduction and investors wary of a political confrontation sold Italian bonds with the resulting financialmarket strains compounding a slowdown in Italys economyThe Commission confirmed on Wednesday that it had accepted a new Italian budget plan targeting a deficit of 2 of gross domestic product next year instead of the previous 24 target under spending plans that Brussels said were likely to result in a deficit closer to 3With the economic outlook worsening both Rome and Brussels lost the appetite for a confrontation and both sides gave much ground Frances fiscal giveaways announced this month to appease street protesters against President Emmanuel Macron also weakened the EUs hawkish camp on the Italian budget disputeThe Commission expressed open doubts on Wednesday about the compromise agreement including on whether Italy would deliver the promised savings and where economic growth would come fromThe solution is not ideal said the European Commissioner for the euro Valdis Dombrovskis He said Italys plans remained only on the borderline of what Brussels had hoped forItaly urgently needs to restore confidence in its economy to ease financial conditions and support investment he saidItalys longlasting economic pain combined with public anger over illegal immigration from Africa and the Middle East drove more than half of all Italians to vote for the League and 5 Star at the expense of Italys mainstream parties in March elections The winning parties promised to boost welfare spending and cut taxes while reversing a pension reform that raised the retirement ageEconomists said the promises while popular did little to address the roots of Italys lack of growth the stagnation of productivity since the mid1990s reflecting deepseated weaknesses in the countrys public and business sectors much of which have struggled to adapt to globalization and new technologiesThe League and 5 Star have proposed few overhauls to address the productivity malaise instead focusing on fiscal measures to boost household demand while tackling poverty and inequalityItalys economy is now at risk of a shallow recession after slightly contracting in the third quarter Growth prospects for next year remain meager On Wednesday the government said it cut its growth forecasts for next year to 1 from its previous prediction of 15 Most economists consider even the lower forecast as too optimistic and criticize Italy for failing to implement muchneeded overhauls to ease the burden of bureaucracy and regulations on the economyUnder the budget compromise the Commission dropped its insistence that Italys underlying or structural budget deficit stripping out swings in the economic cycle and onetime items should fall in 2019 Instead the Commission said Italys structural deficit will remain unchangedFor the Commission the agreement defuses what had been a tense standoff with one of the blocs founding members at a time when the EU is struggling with the growth of populist parties Brexit and other major challengesMr Dombrovskis said that under the agreement Italy has to make 1025 billion in savings compared with its initial budget plan Most of next years savings will come from delaying the start of the governments two flagship policies introducing a basic income for the poor and unemployed and reducing the pension age from around 67 to as low as 62But the delay also means the measures will do less to stimulate consumer demand next yearOther savings come from promises to raise taxes on business and reduce public investment spending steps that Mr Dombrovskis noted werent growth friendlyIn addition Italy will also freeze 2 billion in planned spending unless the deficit is on track to hit the agreed 2 targetMr Dombrovskis warned that once Italys spending plans come fully into effect in coming years extra savings will have to be found To meet these Italy has promised if necessary to raise valueadded tax in 202021 a step that Mr Dombrovskis noted previous Italian governments have promised but repeatedly backed away fromWrite to Giovanni Legorano at giovannilegoranowsjcom and Laurence Norman at laurencenormanwsjcom

for at least three more months after pledges from Baghdad to buy American oil and energy technology reports Benoit Faucon Timothy Puko and Isabel ColesThe decision extends a 45day waiver Iraq received from the USs Iran sanctions in November as the country relies on Iranian natural gas for up to 45 of its electricity needsThe Trump administration has tried to use the threat of crippling penalties to help US companies get a head start over European rivals and wean Baghdad off its dependence on Iranian gas according to administration officialsIraqs exemption was among nine that the US granted to

questions about whether oilandgas producers can stem the rout writes the Journals Amrith RamkumarShares of energy companies largely missed out on a robust oilprice rally in the first nine months of the year The SampP 500 energy sector peaked in May with a yeartodate gain of 86 when oil was trading at about 70 a barrel The shares failed to rally higher even as US crude prices surged above 75 in

create jobs attract investment and develop industries such as tourism see article  For decades oilrich Gulf states have made similar promises only to backtrack when the price of oil rises Muhammad bin Salman Saudi Arabias powerful crown prince has kept his country on course better than his predecessors But the progress is illusory Dig past the headline numbers and so far the results of Prince Muhammads reforms are disappointing Take the stockmarket It looks healthy in part because the government is secretly propping it up by placing huge buy orders to counter selloffs following recent political crises according to the Wall Street Journal The GDP figures are also misleading The economy remains yoked to oil Higher prices for the black stuff notwithstanding a sharp fall in recent months are boosting all sectors But for an economy with rapid population growth coming out of recession the performance is hardly stellar Three years ago GDP growth stood at 4 Prince Muhammad wants foreign investors to think that Saudi Arabia is a safe bet But his capricious policies from the lockingup of wealthy Saudis in 2017 to pointless diplomatic feuds with Canada and Germany are scaring them off Foreign direct investment fell to 14bn 02 of GDP  in 2017 from 75bn the year before An investment conference in Riyadh in October was overshadowed by the grisly murder of Jamal Khashoggi an exiled Saudi journalist in a Saudi consulate in Turkey Rich Saudis are trying to move their money abroad 80bn left the country last year There have been steps to improve the investment climate including a new law to bring order to Saudi bankruptcy procedures Projects once dominated by the state are now planned as publicprivate partnerships The housing ministry for example wants private firms to stump up most of the estimated 100bn required to build 1m affordable homes More than 15m Saudis are on a waiting list for subsidised housing When he courts investors though Prince Muhammad focuses on statedirected megaprojects like Neom a futuristic 500bn city staffed by robots on the northwestern coast Little has been built On December 10th he broke ground on Spark a 16bn energy city in the east that is meant to create 100000 jobs Such schemes rarely work The King Abdullah Financial District a 10bn project in Riyadh still has more buildings than banks Rising oil revenues and austerity measures such as cuts to subsidies and a new 5 valueadded tax have helped drastically reduce the budget deficit The government has duly increased public spending the lifeblood of the economy Saudis are buying more than they did during the recession But many still feel pinched Retail sales are sluggish especially for bigticket items The number of retail jobs has fallen by 177000 since 2017 negating the governments efforts to create opportunities for Saudis by banning foreigners from many sales jobs Jobs are Saudi Arabias most immediate headache It needs to create 12m of them by 2022 to meet its target of 9 unemployment for Saudi citizens To free up work for them it is discouraging the hiring of foreigners Since January 2018 firms have been charged 400 rials 107 per month for each foreign worker with a discount if they employ more Saudi nationals than expatriates The levy will double by 2020 Migrants pay another fee for each of their dependents At first glance these charges seem to be working Almost 1m foreign workers have left the kingdom since the start of 2017 But Saudis are not replacing many of them Construction has been disproportionately affected It employs 45 of the expats and accounts for 60 of the exodus The number of Saudis working in construction though has also fallen Overall since January 2017 the number of Saudis in work has grown by less than 100000 the unemployment rate has increased by 02 percentage points to 129 Jobs once held by migrants are not being filled because they no longer exist You have these expats with low skills low wages and you can easily not renew their contracts says Abdullah alHassan a government economist Young Saudis are reluctant to work with their handsand anyway firms cannot afford them A lowskilled foreign worker takes home around 1500 rials each month The de facto minimum wage for Saudi citizens is 3000 rials The pay gap is much narrower for skilled jobs and there is a pool of talent eager to do such work 56 of Saudi jobseekers hold at least a bachelors degree Officials have therefore discussed putting the migrant fees on a progressive scale linked to income Though many of them are unemployed young Saudis who make up a majority of the population still speak enthusiastically about Prince Muhammad Having alienated the kingdoms clerics and other princes he relies more on their support than past Saudi rulers did His bold some say rash style is popular with them but it worries investors Without foreign money the prince will find it difficult to keep all of those young Saudis happy This article

discrimination in the workplace starts to occur At the Longevity Forum in London last month Professor Lynda Gratton said that ageism at work began at 40 for women and 45 for men Many employees careers peaked at these ages they were no longer considered for promotion or trainingIn the UK age is a protected characteristic in the same way as gender race or sexual orientation By law you should not suffer discrimination because you are too old too young or even too middleagedUnfortunately some employers pay little heed to this in the knowledge that the risk of legal action is small In redundancy programmes it is commonplace to target older employees who are often perceived as more expensive to keep in employment than their younger counterpartsProf Gratton coauthor of The 100 Year Life Living and Work in an Age of Longevity has founded the Hot Spots Movement to counter this trend Set up to enable companies to prepare for the future of work the consultancy encourages employers to futureproof their organisations and make sure their inclusion and diversity strategies are fit for purpose However until employers catch up employees and job applicants have to ageproof themselvesResearch by the Centre for Ageing Better CfAB in September indicated the size of the problem Nearly half of those over 50 thought that their age would disadvantage them if they applied for a new job and a third thought there were fewer opportunities for training and progression with their existing companyYet skills shortages are changing attitudes to ageism and many employers are beginning to question their recruitment policiesCompanies need to wake up to the opportunities of an ageing workforce says Anne Willmot Age Campaign director at Business in the Community Employers can now have up to five generations working together in the same workplace They need to take action now as by 2022 there will be 800000 more older workers and 300000 fewer 1624 year olds entering the workplaceCurrently only one in three UK workers are aged over 50 and around 15m people a year are leaving the UK workforce The shrinking pool of talent is likely to make the retention of experienced and committed employees essentialAndy Briggs chief executive of Aviva Life in the UK and Ireland says businesses are going to struggle if they dont embrace older workers and should make better efforts to retain and retrain them The leader of BITCs Age at Work leadership team Mr Briggs has been appointed by the government as the business champion for older workers Jobseekers can use the BITC website to identify companies that have made a public statement about wanting to recruit the best possible people regardless of age The view that companies should be more inclusive of older workers is backed by recent research by the Harvard Business Review which claims diversity is the key to unlocking innovation in a business Diverse companies those that were open to workers of all backgrounds and ages were 45 per cent more likely to report growth in market shareAccording to Aviva championing older workers in its life insurance division contributed to an increase in new business which grew by 32 per cent in the first half of 2017 compared to the previous yearBy understanding the needs of our over50s customers and building a workforce that understands empathises and has the necessary skills to deliver exceptional service were delivering sectorleading customer advocacy says Mr BriggsThe company is also increasing retention and performance rates by helping its older workers to progress and develop In 2017 the number of existing employees making a vertical or horizontal move increased by nearly 45 per centThe number of new hires aged 50 and over jumped 33 per cent in 2017 and the total proportion of over50s employed has risen by 6 per cent halfway towards the companys fiveyear targetCompanies should also be aware that standard recruitment practices can unconsciously discriminate against older workers Applied an online recruitment agency works to remove ageidentifying information from applications and gives applicants written tasks as part of its recruitment process It has found that more than half the successful applicants would not have been hired by traditional CVbased selection methodsBarclays launched its Bolder Apprenticeship programme to target those who had retired early or faced redundancy and HM Revenue amp Customs recently held an Age Summit where it presented data to challenge age stereotypesRich Bristow director at Astute Business Mentors a business consultancy that uses retired senior managers says that Barclays Boots Aviva and the Coop all plan to increase the number of over50s they employ by 12 per cent by 2022 These plans are worthy of support but anecdotal evidence suggests the employment of older people by companies tends to be in the low to middleincome ranges he says This leaves a group of retirees the exsenior employees and board members with no discernible organisation to turn to for workbased activityAs the pensions system becomes less generous another reality of living for longer is that we will need to work for longer The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development CIPD found over 55s were now bracing themselves to continue working to the age of 70 Its shocking that despite a large proportion of UK

Pawel Pawlikowski saw how to transform their tumultuous postwar romance into a film Their on and off and onagain relationship spanned decades and took them from Communist Poland to Germany With time it became more of a story he says the matrix of all love storiesMr Pawlikowski tells a fictionalized version in Cold War which Amazon Studios will release in theaters on Friday The Polish and Frenchlanguage movie won Mr Pawlikowski the best director award at this years Cannes Film Festival and on Monday was named to the Academy Awards shortlist for foreign films which will eventually be narrowed to five nomineesWatch a clip from the movie Cold War starring Joanna Kulig and Tomasz Kot Photo Amazon StudiosJoanna Kulig stars as Zula a singer and Tomasz Kot as Wiktor who meet in 1949 when she auditions for a Polish folkmusic troupe in which he is a pianist In the shadow of Stalinism Zula admits early on that she has been spying on Wiktor for the government but would never reveal anything damaging The story of passion betrayal and cultural displacement makes daring leaps in time now and then moving ahead by a couple of years Wiktor defects to Germany then goes to Paris where he and Zula are reunited and an unhappy Zula dances on top of a bar to Rock Around the Clock in the jazz club where he plays piano Music from folk to jazz infuses the blackandwhite film with Ms Kulig doing her own singing as the couples enduring connection finally leads them back to Poland in 1964Mr Pawlikowski 61 years old left Warsaw for London with his mother when he was 14 He has spent most of his adult life in the UK where he made films including My Summer of Love 2004 starring the thenunknown Emily Blunt He returned to Poland to make Ida which in 2015 won the Academy Award for best foreignlanguage film Ida about a young nun in postwar Poland who learns that she is Jewish helped him see how to recreate his parents saga I realized it shouldnt literally be their story he says Although their real names were Wiktor and Zula he was a doctor and she was a ballet dancer His mother was in a folk ensemble but unlike Zula didnt con her way in or serve prison timetwo aspects of the onscreen character that demonstrate as Mr Pawlikowski says she does whatever she needs to do to surviveIda helped Mr Pawlikowski find a style that he would later use to make Cold War I realized it could be told elliptically not like these biopicy things where you go from A to B to C where theres always cause and effect he says That makes films untrue because theres never a single causeShooting in blackandwhite resulted in a more vibrant look Mr Pawlikowski says If you went for colors of Poland at that time it would be basically murky and grayMs Kulig prepared for the sardonic tone Mr Pawlikowski wanted by watching video of Lauren Bacall As Zula evolves from fauxpeasant folk musician to worldweary torch singer Ms Kulig also found inspiration in Marilyn Monroe and Amy Winehouse That kind of personality very talented but at the same time with something difficult in their childhood and how they destroyed themselves in the end says Ms Kulig that was quite similar to what Zula did Because Wiktor and Zulas lives coincided with the Cold War like his parents Mr Pawlikowski says it is impossible to sort out how much of their relationship is shaped by political realities and how much by character Its both Wiktor would not have had to leave the country if not for Stalinism in Poland in the early 50s when he a welleducated man who loves jazz is urged to play music honoring land reform And theres also a character problem because they have very different temperaments Even after Mr Pawlikowski won the Oscar for Ida it wasnt easy to get Cold War made Youre not exactly back to square one but we had to stitch together about 15 sources of financing he says If you tell a story in Polish with actors who are not known worldwide and in black and white the algorithm tells you its not going to make a lot of money He is betting against that algorithm Although this is a very weird and eccentric story most people have one love story that maybe they abandoned or thats stayed with them he says All these shenanigans of love most people have had in some shape or form More in FilmPenny Marshall Laverne amp Shirley Star Dies at 75December 18 2018 Mary Poppins Sequel Years Later

ambitions have emerged in other European countries Calls for nationalizations have come from the populist left in Spain and the nationalist right in Hungary and France Their common target is the technocratic consensus of Europes broadly centrist mainstream parties that the continent needs to privatize deregulate limit social protections boost competition and let in foreign capital in order to grow That promarket orthodoxy among mainstream policy makers known as liberalism in Continental Europe has guided much EU policy during the past quartercentury But its electoral support always inconsistent has suffered further thanks to scars of Europes long financial crisis All three of Americas most important allies in Europe are undergoing political crises of their own WSJs Gerald F Seib explains why voters in the UK France and Germany might be restless Photos Getty The EUs move towards economic liberalism has come under pressure from time to time in the past but now that pressure is increasing said Fabrizio Onida professor emeritus of international economics at Bocconi University in Milan While many economists argue there is a role for the state in some economic sectors such as running public transportation and as a regulator of certain industries they generally decry the movement of private companies to state ownership through nationalizations Alitalia has had a troubled past decade under various private owners costing Italian taxpayers about 10 billion 11 billion in that period according to Andrea Giuricin a professor at Milans Bicocca University Last year the bankrupt company faced liquidation until Italys previous centerleft government extended a 900 million bridge loan meant to tie the airline over until administrators could find a buyer The new populist

control of Polish banks from foreign investors Italy has stepped in to prop up Alitalia before The national post service Poste Italiane SpA was briefly a shareholder earlier this decade while the government has also given financial inducements to private investors But such stopgap measures were meant to pave the way to Alitalias being a viable privatesector company Now in contrast the

tieup A Ferrovie spokesman declined to comment Italys economic development minister Luigi Di Maio who heads the 5 Star Movement tried to get other companies in which the government has a stake including oil giant Eni SpA electricity producer Enel SpA and defense contractor Leonardo SpA to invest in Alitalia Those companies resisted Delta Air Lines Inc and EasyJet PLC submitted their own offers for Alitalia but the Italian airlines bankruptcy commissioners preferred the Ferrovie bid The two companies are now in talks with Ferrovie to become coinvestors according to a person familiar with the discussions Delta and EasyJet declined to comment Lufthansa had earlier shown interest but CEO Carsten Spohr recently told analysts Surely we will not be interested to be coinvestors with a government in an airline which needs to be restructured Public ownership of key industries is an old preference of Europes left Spains Podemos which won more than a fifth of the vote in the last general election proposes nationalizing sectors such as energy and telecommunications But the renewed push for state interventionism extends also to Europes nationalist right which has a long tradition of suspicion toward free markets laissezfaire economics and especially foreign capital For the nationalist right a strong state role in the economy is about defending national sovereignty Hungary under vocal EU critic Viktor Orban has turned to nationalizations as part of its declared goal of promoting national strength Critics say such talk is partly cover for the growing corruption of a new economic elite close to the premier Polands nationalist government has been pushing to rePolonize banks by having the treasury buy shares from foreign investors and discouraging further foreign stakes In France farright leader Marine Le Pen has also called for nationalizing banks and raising trade barriers President Emmanuel Macrons marketoriented strategy has come under attack in the past month with violent street protests engulfing the country These calls for nationalizations a policy that has been out of vogue in Europe because of the shortcomings of public ownership are a way to lash out against the establishment said Michael Plummer an economics professor and the director at Johns Hopkins Universitys School of Advanced International Studies in Bologna Many economists

directorgeneral Tony Hall to tackle media misinformation that is likely to spiral as video manipulation becomes more prevalent Lord Hall said in a Financial Times interview that fake news was one of the biggest threats facing our democraciesTechnology companies such as Facebook and Google will be invited to attend the BBC conference along with academic institutions and other media organisationsI want us to get together with newspapers and people who think like us to understand how to tell the fake from the true said Lord Hall If we think its bad now its going to get even worse when you can manipulate video imagesHe is planning the conference after a turbulent year for the BBC From criticism over the salaries paid to top male stars to doubts over the future of free television licences for the over75s the public service broadcaster was rarely out of the headlines Highs and lows for the corporationYet it was also a year of creative success Lord Hall pointed to the unbelievable audience of 19m people who watched the BBC1 hit Bodyguard as well as other acclaimed series such as Killing Eve David Attenboroughs Dynasties and They Shall Not Grow Old the startling Peter Jackson documentary on the first world warIn terms of the risk taking that we do our backing of talent and big ideaswere really doing well he saidBut off screen the corporation was criticised by a parliamentary committee in the autumn for failing to live up to its dutyto advance equal opportunity for womenThe BBC1 hit drama Bodyguard starring Keeley HawesThe committee investigated the BBC after Carrie Gracie its former China editor said she had suffered genderrelated pay discriminationThe BBC has been on the back foot on pay since 2017 when it published a list of its topearning staff a roster that was dominated by menSince then its median gender pay gap has fallen from 93 per cent to 76 per cent as more women have been promoted to senior rolesHighearning stars such as Chris Evans and Eddie Mair have also left the BBC Lord Hall said he was sad to see them go but pointed to the female talent taking big roles such as Zoe Ball who replaces Mr Evans on Radio 2Funding of TV licences for the over75s The fate of free TV licences for the over75s promises to be a new flashpoint in the next few months with responsibility for funding the scheme due to pass to the BBC in June 2020 as a condition of its royal charterThe scheme is currently paid for by the government and will cost the BBC an estimated 745m by 20212022Lord Hall said the broadcaster would be forced to close channels and popular services if it absorbs the full cost of the scheme and recently launched a public consultation to assess views on its new responsibilityAmong the options under consideration are scrapping the scheme which is likely to cause public anger and introducing meanstesting so poorer pensioners do not have to pay for TV licencesWhatever we do we have to think about what is fair said Lord Hall That means fairness to pensioners many of whom are in poverty and fairness to other licence fee payers A colour TV licence costs 15050Journalist Carrie Gracie centre and BBC employees gather outside Broadcasting House in London to highlight the issue of equal pay on International Womens DayHe expressed pride in the BBCs news output at a time of political division over Brexit and said it had been keen to host a debate recently featuring prime minister Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn the Labour leaderAlthough Mrs May raised the possibility of a debate on her Brexit deal it was ultimately shelvedIm not sure anyone really wanted it to happen but we did said Lord Hall People said the BBC had a very complex programme format and that it should just be head to head Corbyn versus May My view is completely the oppositewe should be exploring all the different viewsThe former chief executive of the Royal Opera House also acknowledged recent criticism of BBC presenters who have expressed personal opinions on TwitterAndrew Neil who presents the political show This Week apologised recently for calling the journalist Carole Cadwalladr a mad cat woman while Match of the Day presenter Gary Linekers vocal opposition to Brexit has made him a target of Leave campaignersAndrew apologised for that tweet said Lord Hall There are some people that arent part of the BBCs news and current affairs universe where you can afford to take a different view and I would put Gary in that positionThe future of ondemand streaming The BBCs place in a media era increasingly characterised by ondemand streaming and companies such as Netflix is another issue for the broadcasterThe BBC will put more programming on iPlayer over Christmas but is limited in how much it can make available and the length of time the programming can be viewed because of concerns by Ofcom the UK media regulator that increased usage could harm the broadcasters commercial rivalsiPlayer is the way people will consume the BBC in the future said Lord Hall We need more content there and for longer This is no longer a catchup serviceits a destination He confirmed the BBC was in constructive talks with ITV on a joint UK streaming service that would pool older and new programming from both broadcastersThe two organisations already collaborate on BritBox a subscription service in the US Will Channel 4 and Channel 5 also participate in the proposed new UK streaming service I can only really speak about what were doing with ITV said Lord HallAs he prepares for 2019 the BBC directorgeneral does not expect negative headlines on the broadcaster to ceaseOne of the things you put up with if youre taking 15050 from most people is that youre in the public eye he said Our job is to accept that and not be pompous and arrogant but remind people just what they get for that fee

Here’s How They Did It","Chinese spies stole documents related to foreign policy and trade from the United Nations, European Union, and others, says a new report.",http://fortune.com/2018/12/19/china-eu-hacking/,2018-12-19 17:30:16,Chinese hackers have reportedly compromised a network used by European Union countries to relay diplomatic messages allowing the intruders to spy on sensitive correspondence about everything from foreign policy to trade to weapons The intrusion into the EU network known as COREU was part of a coordinated cyberespionage campaign that also breached more than 100 organizations including the United Nations various ministries of foreign affairs labor unions and think tanks according to Area 1 a cybersecurity firm based in Redwood City Calif In a report published on Wednesday Area 1 said hackers infiltrated computer systems belonging to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Cyprus and then used that foothold to gain access to the COREU network which they looted for classified messages of other countries The spies swiped thousands of diplomatic cables relating to subjects such as nuclear proliferation arms control human rights regional diplomatic talks and other international matters The Council Secretariat is aware of allegations regarding a potential leak of sensitive information and is actively investigating the issue a spokesperson at the press office for the European Council told Fortune in an email The spokesperson said the office does not comment on allegations nor on matters relating to operational security and added that the council takes the security of its facilities including its IT systems extremely seriouslyIn the stolen cables whose contents were reported by the New York Times European diplomats fret about matters like President Trumps conduct towards China and in one case describe a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin as successful at least for Putin The United Nations and the AFLCIO were separately pillaged as part of the same espionage campaign that targeted COREU Area 1 said in its report The authors pointed to logs of activity on affected computers and other technical details to make the case these organizations had fallen victim to a single ongoing spy operation  Farhan Haq deputy spokesperson for the SecretaryGeneral of the UN said the organization has no information about the alleged breach When cyberattacks and attempted intrusions occur they are generally only reported internally and for most incidents the United Nations does not have sufficient information to conclusively attribute such attacks he saidJosh Goldstein communications director for the AFLCIO said the union was aware of a previous breach in security protocols But he downplayed the situation insisting that we were able to fix the vulnerability that was used and verify that no data was compromised Officials from Cyprus declined to comment The statements jar against information contained in the Area 1 report which purports to show evidence of data copied and lifted from internal networks Oren Falkowitz Area 1s CEO and cofounder told Fortune that his team aided by its global network of sensors detected the intrusion into the European diplomatic cable network in late November The team then investigated the breach and traced its perpetrators activity to a string of breaches dating as far back as April 2015 A former National Security Agency and US Cyber Command officer Falkowitz said he alerted United States authorities including the Federal Bureau of Investigation about his teams findings on Dec 10 Falkowitz and his team said they have attributed the breaches to Chinas Strategic Support Force a hacker unit of the Peoples Liberation Army He said the attackers technology and tradecraft some of which is detailed in the report matched Beijings style Our attribution of this campaign is based on extensive technical analysis and over a decade of experience countering Chinese cyber operations said Blake Darche chief security officer and cofounder of Area 1 who formerly worked at the US National Security Agency Press officers for the Chinese embassy in Washington DC did not respond to emails seeking commentWhat HappenedThe attacks all followed the same templateEach used standard phishing methods to steal the login credentials of network administrators and senior staff of the affected organizations Falkowitz said The hackers then probed the victims machines moved across their networks and implanted a malicious software program called PlugX which establishes a socalled backdoorWhile on the machines the hackers were able to explore file directories log keystrokes capture screenshots and grab reams of data In the COREU breach Area 1 said the intruders stole communications pertaining to European Council working parties and committee reports on the EUs relations with Asia and other regions as well as documents concerning security and military technologiesIn the AFLCIO breach the looters got their hands on documents from top officers of the union including legal counsels Area 1 said They also nabbed backups of password files which at least one staffer stored using 1Password a popular password management applicationThe hackers then zipped the files compressing their size added a password protections and disguised the resulting documents with innocuous soundingnames like infostxt Sometimes the attackers would break down these files into smaller batches presumably to sneak the data off networks while raising fewer flagsThe hackers removed the data by sending them to public cloud services such as Google Drive The spies attempted to erase their tracks but Area 1 said it was able to observe and map out their activity The company has shared in its report technical indicators associated with the breaches so that other organizations can check to see whether they were similarly targetedThe hackers continued to have access to the COREU network as recently as last week Falkowitz saidImplicationsThe strategic goals of the recent wave of cyberattacks are not clear in part because they appear directed at such a broad range of entities including think tanks unions and government ministries Falkowitz points to stolen files related to the proposed Trans Pacific Partnership to speculate that China was in part seeking intelligence about global trade negotiationsa sensitive topic for the Trump Administration and a key instrument of geopolitical power  The hacking may also have been spurred by general opportunism According to Adam Segal a cybersecurity expert at the Council on Foreign Relations China regards cyberspace as incredibly important for achieving three goals economic growth controlling information and military advantage In this context the hackers may have been seeking to monitor their targets in hopes of gathering any useful information rather than to obtain specific trade files  If Area 1s attribution is correct the attacks underscore Chinese hackers success in rummaging through cyberspaceand also how poorly its targets have fared in deflecting them This failure to defend can be chalked up in part to the complexity of guarding networks especially those at bureaucratic and multipronged institutions like the European Union IT security remains a nightmare within the EU not only because of the technical challenge of harmonizing 28 IT security systems but also because of the incentive countries have to leak confidential documents to nonEU allies said Federica Bicchi a professor at the London School of Economics who has published a history of the COREU network The failure to rebuff this latest round of hacks is also notable given Chinas prior track record In 2012 US lawmakers decried a furious wave of cyberespionage aimed at think tanks and warned that sensitive academic and diplomatic data was being stolen  Meanwhile US discussions with China on the cyber front have regressed since former President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping reached a bilateral agreement in 2015 That pact reportedly led to a downturn in hacking incidents from China but only a temporary onePotential Response Past cyberattacks by China have triggered retaliatory measures by the US including sanctions and the filing of criminal charges against individual hackers Its unclear however whether the incidents directed at the EU and the AFLCIO will prompt similar measures by the US or by European governments  According to Segal many of the organizations described in the Area 1 reportincluding governments and think tankswould be considered to be fair game under the norms of spycraft and that other countries conduct similar operations It is only when Chinas hackers seek to plunder companies for economic gain that the US has reacted in a forceful public fashion he added Chinas success at breaching COREU the UN the AFLCIO and the other organizations nonetheless raises questions about whether anything can be done to stop such cyberattacks According to Falkowitz any response must begin by recognizing the attacks are not particularly sophisticated Rather he says they rely on a cookie cutter approach that involves repeatedly probing the target with phishing emails until someone clicks on a boobytrapped link to let the hackers in  Cyberattacks are more like cogs in an assembly line than they are individual snowflakes Falkowitz said From a technical perspective its rather boring to be honest but the impact is super super high

rates",https://www.ft.com/content/2a810908-0cf6-11e9-b2f2-f4c566a4fc5f,2019-01-04 16:59:46,How much more damage can central banks do to share values At the end of last year there was a sharp selloff in shares in the US the eurozone and Japan as investors took fright at the thought of slowing growth and further rate rises to comeThe US has been leading the movement with a series of rate rises and another two or three pencilled in The Bank of England has carried out two so far but leaves us in doubt about when or whether there will be more When rates go up less money is likely to be advanced Companies and individuals that have borrowed need to spend more of their income on servicing debt and less on other things Its a traditional way of slowing economies for fear of inflation and too much creditThe FT fund fell a little over 2 per cent during the year Holding more than half of assets in cash and shortterm bonds cushioned the worst of the falls while the accent on technology helped during the first nine months of 2018 Towards the end of the year I committed an additional 5 per cent to shares I put 25 per cent into a global exchange traded fund based on an index of companies specialising in digital technologies I also put 25 per cent into a German share fund following the dire performance of the German market over 2018 I had sold out completely from the euro area ahead of its problems I thought it would do badly against the background of the Italian budget row slowing growth the end of quantitative easing and the loss of political popularity for the traditional EUsupporting governments The German car industry was particularly vulnerable to monetary tightening and to changes in emissions regulations More recently a compromise appears to have been found over the Italian budget and the news of a slowdown is now widely understood Share prices have fallen a long way to discount the reality The car industry has some strong brands and will adjust to regulatory changes though it may still have to confront the US over the issue of differential tariffs between the US and the EUThe less mentioned part of the story of falling markets is the growing wish of the main central banks to reverse their postcrisis policy of quantitative easing Bond and share markets got used to elevated valuations sustained by endless official buying of bonds In the case of Japan the central bank also buys shares while elsewhere the shares are bid up by the people and institutions reinvesting the cash from selling their bonds to the central banks at high prices In the US the Federal Reserve has been busily winding down its extensive portfolio of government bonds contracting its balance sheet and cancelling the money it created to buy them In the UK the Bank of England has ceased creating additional money to buy bonds and has slowed growth in the money supply drastically by means of monetary policy The European Central Bank has sustained a better rate of money growth in 2018 but ends the year with the same plan as the UK to end additional quantitative easing from January 1It is important not to underestimate the impact that quantitative tightening is having on markets and economies as it reverses years of bond buying by the central banks Just as quantitative easing drove down longer term interest rates as central banks paid up for the bonds they were buying so the reverse tends to drive up longer term interest rates as that buying force is removedIn the US in particular we saw a sharp move upwards in the 10year bond yield from a low of 14 per cent in 2016 to over 3 per cent last year In the UK the 10year bond yield rose from 05 to 16 per cent over the same period while the German 10year Bund rose from 019 to 077 per cent More recently these yields have fallen a bit despite the continued tightening a warning from markets to the central banks that they are overdoing the policy of QE reversal and creating disinflationary or even recessionary conditionsHow can this be It is because removing the money or additional buying power from the markets has a multiplier effect through the banking system Part of the magic expected from QE was that the cash paid to the person or institution selling the bond would rest in a bank account pending anything more exciting being done with it This swelling of the deposits and cash position of the commercial banks could help them lend more The idea was a winwin If the seller of the bond took a risk by making a riskier investment that was good for the economy If they sat on the cash the banks could gear the money and lend it onI used to describe the policy postcrisis as driving the economy with one foot firmly on the brake and one firmly depressing the accelerator The extra money to buy bonds was an accelerant The regulatory pressures on commercial banks to hold more cash and capital for any given amount of lending was the brake This meant a slow recovery at best as loans from regulated institutions were scarce Today the foot is being lifted from the accelerator in the expectation that the commercial banks are now able to sustain a normal rate of growth and progress Their balance sheets are much strengthened The problem is the drying up of new cash from the central banks removes one of the sources of extra cash for the banks to lend onAs a result we see falls in housing purchases and car buying on both sides of the Atlantic as the price of credit rises and its availability is squeezed We see a wavering in intentions on business investment as fears grow that we have seen the best of the economic recovery The digital revolution sweeps on and remains the most important influence on the fortunes of companies and sectors This is at its most visible on the high street where great traditional retailers struggle against highly competitive online challengers Digital models are reshaping everything from cars to advertising professional advice and healthcare

nearvertical shore of the Ilhu de Santana a tiny islet in the archipelago of So Tom and Prncipe floating in West Africas Gulf of Guinea In my minds eye I pictured my husband losing his grip tumbling into the blue depth of the Atlantic where apart from our guides small motor boat all I could see was a sole fisherman in a wooden dugoutWhen we told friends and colleagues of our plan to escape South Africas winter for a oneweek break on So Tom and Prncipe the most common response we heard was Whats that The continents secondsmallest country after the Seychelles So Tom and Prncipe is only just starting to build its profile as a destination for travelers who like us are keen to combine hiking through dense rain forests and past fading colonial mansions with flopping on deserted sandy beachesWhen Portuguese explorers sailing down Africas west coast toward the equator discovered So Tom island and the smaller Principe in the 1470s they were uninhabited Having erupted into the Atlantic some 30 million years ago the islands were never attached to the mainland and today boast endemic plant bat and bird species not found elsewhere on the continent The Portuguese soon realized that the volcanic soil lent itself to sugar production and started importing slaves to work their plantationsDescendants of those slaves and the laborers brought in from Portugals other African

Peladeau a former chef in Paris who now runs an excellent Airbnb in the small town of Santana about a 20minute drive from So Tom city told us a simple rule of thumb for exploring the island Downhill turns from the main road will likely lead to a beach Going uphill will take you to one of the old plantations or roas Provided you arent deterred by paths more closely resembling riverbeds than roads these uphill excursions make for excellent trips into colonial historyor as I couldnt help think horrormovie setsOne such detour led us to Roa Monte Caf an old plantation that grows coffee brought to the island from Brazil by the Portuguese The small museum has Englishspeaking guides who explain the difference between robusta and arabica beans the first has a stronger more robust flavor and how the exploitation of Africans first slaves and then workers lured to the islands under exploitative contracts made the roa system function for centuries To get a good idea of how Saotomeans live today

yet to bother to put the market up on their screens Historically the muni market while huge was a sort of gated community for US taxpayers since the taxfree nature of muni bond interest did not matter much for nonresidentsIn recent years though the draining away of fixedincome yield around the world has made US munis attractive to foreigners who are now among the major suppliers of new money to the market As one opportunistic American muni investor points out The average 30year muni bond now pays 105 per cent of the yield of the 30year US Treasury And unlike Treasuries most of those munis can be called after 10 years It is one of the best fixedincome opportunities in the worldPolitical and financial journalists like to write about the travails of the New York tristate area California and maybe Puerto Rico and Chicago Most of the state and municipal government world though is incredibly dull and responsible North Carolina Utah New Hampshire Ever read about themWe should not ignore the disasters of course such as Detroit and Puerto Rico Detroit was perhaps the most postapocalyptically cinematic with trees growing in the railway station abandoned houses and discount firearms The dysfunctional city filed for municipal bankruptcy in 2013 It emerged with trimmed pensions and health benefits and more deeply whacked bond principal 17 months laterDetroits initial postbankruptcy borrowing for capital improvements required state government supervision and support At the beginning of December though Detroit issued its first new bond as a standalone credit It was for just 135m and carried a junk rating but paid an average of just 48 per cent which is not bad under the circumstances In the American secondact tradition Detroit has revived job growth and has cool young urban pioneersPuerto Ricos bankruptcy will drag out far longer than Detroits While the island also suffered from the devastation of Hurricane Maria two years ago the more insidious and less readily fixed damage has been done by the failure of the local governing classDetroit was overseen strictly by the state of Michigan during its insolvency Puerto Rico was also supposed to have firm guidance from a federally imposed oversight board The commonwealths governor and legislature however have often ignored the board or litigated against its authorityCongress and the Trump administration could theoretically intervene more to restructure Puerto Ricos governance The reality though is that they would like to ignore it After a spectacular rally last year Puerto Ricos paper is gradually starting to sell offPuerto Ricos rollercoaster ride is the exception though Most of the US muni market is boring safe and remunerative I think we will see more internationals seeking safety there

buy Iranian natural gas without penalty for at least three more months after pledges from Baghdad to buy American oil and energy technology US and Iraqi officials said The decision extends a 45day waiver Iraq received from the USs Iran sanctions in November as the country relies on Iranian natural gas for up to 45 of its electricity needs The Trump administration has tried to use the threat of crippling penalties to help US companies get a head start over European rivals and wean Baghdad off its dependence on Iranian gas according to administration officials Iraqs exemption was among nine that the US granted to countries that buy a lot of Iranian energy including China and Turkey But the US increased its leverage over Iraq by limiting the countrys waiver to 45 days while the others received six months A State Department spokesman confirmed the waiver saying the efforts will continue to promote the use of Iraqi natural resources strengthen Iraqs economy and development and encourage a united democratic and prosperous Iraq free from malign Iranian influence An Iraqi official said the new 90day sanctions exemption would give us time to sign with US companies

overseeing development of Iraqs southern oil fields but declined to comment further GE Exxon and Iraqs oil ministry declined to comment Orion didnt commentAccording to Iraqi and US officials Mr Perry told Iraqi officials that the US would be more likely to continue allowing naturalgas purchases from Iran for now if Iraq improved its business environment and struck deals with companies that could help it find new sources of energy Many American oil companies say Iraq is among the most difficult oilproducing countries they work in and complain of a bloated bureaucracy endemic corruption and poor profit returns on government contractsSenior Trump administration officials stressed that Mr Perrys connection of sanctions relief and business deals wasnt a quid pro quo but part of the USs longstanding effort to get Iraq to improve the business environment and reduce Irans influence on Iraq While US energy companies would benefit from the lobbying effort so would any foreign companies they said The Administrations discussions with Iraq are focused on helping Iraq make decisions that are in its own best interests including taking the necessary steps to become energy independent from Iran and escape Iranian malign influence an administration official said in an emailed responsePrevious US administrations have avoided explicitly tying American business contracts to relief from sanctions particularly in natural resources like oil and energy But President Trump has encouraged his cabinet secretaries to use as much leverage as possible to prop up US business interests Mr Trump has publicly mused about seizing Iraqs oil as a prize for overthrowing Saddam Hussein and recently said he would consider intervening in the USs effort to extradite Huawei Technologies Cos chief finance from Canada if it would help Washington and Beijing resolve their trade dispute Some reformminded Iraqi officials havent pushed back against the Trump administrations efforts to connect

Aaron Rodgers but how many good days does ARod have left on the frozen tundra Cleveland meanwhile is young and stacked and shedding generations of football selfloathing Plus Bakermania Love that guy Lets move onto the coaches who are still coaching The NFL playoffs kick off next weekend with games on Saturday and Sundayas well as Monday if you count Alabama vs Clemson which I do have you seen those guysStanding here at the start line of 2019 with 12 NFL teams in the mix whats your Super Bowl pick Saints versus Chiefs Logicalbut a little blah to pick two top seeds isnt it You probably order chicken in a steakhouse Rams vs Chiefs A rematch of that 5451 Monday Night Football humdinger Sign me up I wanted to watch that game forever Bears versus Colts A rematch of 2007 Super Bowl XLI Ill need more convincing Remember theres no Prince RIP to bail out the halftime show Cowboys vs Patriots CBS has the Super Bowl this year so youre definitely a CBS executive Eagles vs Patriots Youre definitely a CBS executive from Philly Seahawks vs Chargers Youve been drinking But Ill have what youre having Sounds like bizarre fun The point is as the late William Goldman famously opined nobody knows anything Thats almost always true in an NFL season but especially this one There are a lot of people in fine suits yammering on TV who act like they know whats going to happendo not trust any of these people Theyre not paid to shrug their shoulders and say I have no idea Theyre paid to look you dead in the eye in August and tell you the Minnesota Vikings are going to win the Super Bowl And look what happened thereAll I have is guesswork So heres my guessworkIs it me or do the teams with the best recordsNew Orleans Kansas City the Rams of Los Angelesfeel mildly less juggernauty than they did a month ago The Patriots have been uncharacteristically wobbly and Tom Brady is old enough to buy discount tickets to the movies and talk credibly about Atari but theyre still the Patriots and still snuck their way into the No 2 AFC seed The Baltimore Ravens enter on a win streak aided by rookie quarterback Lamar Jackson but they were within a couple Baker Mayfield completions of being sent home Charm City begins with a rough home date against the Chargers who have a hypermotivated Philip Dont Call Him Phil Rivers and basically play every game on the road anyway since they play in that LA shoebox The playoffs biggest surprisethe resurgent Eaglesare perhaps the playoffs biggest enigma What Philly team is going to show up Unlike last years Super Bowl outfit these Eagles will have to do it all on the road starting Sunday in Chicago But theyve got that footballbuzzy buzzword of momentumand smooth Patriot killer Nick Foles back at the helmSure things I got nothing Andy Reid gives me nerves But can I continue to confer worldbeating wizard status on Grumpy Lobster Boat Captain Bill Belichick Not exactly I have no idea what to make of the Houston Texans I dont know if the Houston Texans know what to make of the Houston Texans Ask JJ Hes a Badger He knows things The only prediction I feel semicomfortable with is the Saints having a good shot at playing through in New Orleans The Superdome is a zesty homefield advantage The last time the Saints had it they vaporized Brett Favre in the NFC title game and won the whole thing I was in New Orleans that nightthe entire city levitated Of course that was a long time ago and the Saints quarterback waswait it was Drew Brees back then too And I like the Chiefs I do I do I do Kansas Citys quasirookie QB Patrick Mahomes was the most exciting player in the league this year unruffled by inexperience or Andy Reid jinxes and its hard to think hell come undone in the playoffs especially with home field A great run for Mahomes is exactly what the NFL craves right now I guess what Im saying is right now I see a ChiefsSaints Super Bowl too I know two frontrunners How logical How blah Im probably the type of person who orders

murderous region Amid the carnage however there are hints of solutions and experiments from across the region which are aimed at bringing the crisis under control New lawenforcement standards datadriven policing tools and social programs are slowing the violence and in some cases dramatically reducing homicide ratesIn 2010 more than 2600 people were killed in Ecuador a homicide rate of about 18 per 100000 almost twice the level the World Health Organization considers an epidemic This year the small Andean nation is expected to record 56 killed per 100000 one of Latin Americas lowest

to be 47 per 100000 still high but improved from 845 per 100000 of five years agoThe most tantalizing of Calis anticrime strategies is identifying some of the citys dangerous young men for personal

easy It requires a combination of political and judicial changes along with economic and social policies to expand education and job opportunities While these ideas have become common practice in the

saying they have confidence in law enforcement compared with 57 in the US TV police dramas are rare in Latin America because the idea of cops solving crimes and catching crooks seems farfetched Police are suspected in some of the regions most brazen crimes of recent years including the disappearance of 43 Mexican college students in 2014 all presumed killed and the slaying this year of a Brazilian

rankedcops earned about 200 a month compared with 295 in Brazil and 400 in Colombia according to Juan Carlos Ruiz a Colombian political scientist at Rosario University in Bogot At the time officers in the US earned an average of 2725 a month With such low salaries you naturally have problems with corruption in some cases he said and in other cases the job just isnt very attractiveIn 2010 hundreds of police in Ecuador rioted over cuts to benefits Worried about rising violence and buoyed by high oil prices the leftist government of thenpresident Rafael Correa raised police salaries that year for the 45000member force Now the lowestranking officers earn about 1000 a month police said among the highest starting pay in Latin AmericaLast year 50000 people applied for 2800 spots officials said Police training in Ecuador has doubled to 18 months Higherranking officers are expected to hold a university degree And authorities built a new forensics lab for ballistics and DNA testing which has boosted the number of arrestsThere also has been a broad crackdown on police corruptionStarting in 2013 any officer who is either in line for a promotion involved in intelligence work or working in neighborhoods known for organized crime must pass a liedetector exam The officers also must undergo a psychological profile and an analysis of personal finances A cop in debt is a vulnerable cop said Col Henry Tapia the deputy inspector general Since the testing started more than 1000 police officers have been fired or charged with crimes We have found commanders involved in all kinds of things from drug trafficking to extortion said police general Patricio Carrillo the head of police operations Central to the lawenforcement overhaul has been data analysis that pinpoint the location time and circumstance of crimes If we arent strategically anticipating crime Gen Carrillo said we will always arrive late just to pick up cadaversIn Guayaquil a team of 18 officers review data at police headquarters producing daily reports and georeferenced maps to help decide where and when to deploy officers That helped Guayaquil reduce homicides to about 200 this year from close to 600 in 2010Ecuador police also employ a 270 million emergency response program called ECU911 The system relies on 4500 highdefinition cameras mounted on light poles around the country Cameras also installed in public busescan track a suspects movement from one block to the next which resulted in the arrest of Mr Torres after the 2015 knife attack Finding a cureTo fight cholera in Victorian London Dr John Snow mapped the location of every fatality from the disease He narrowed down the source of the epidemic to a Broad Street well pumping contaminated water It was a breakthrough not only in treating the disease but in the use of statistical analysis to solve social problemsIn Cali a Harvardtrained epidemiologist and twice mayor Rodrigo Guerrero used the 19th century idea to find out why so many city residents were dying in murdersI said Im going to look at homicides in an epidemiological context recalled Dr Guerrero 81 People then didnt know anything about thatIn the early 1990s Dr Guerrero in a first step determined that 70 of Calis homicides took place in an area that made up 30 of the city While mayor from 2012 to 2015 Dr Guerrero set in motion programsboth for police and communitiesthat have helped shave the homicide rate Now an adviser to Calis local government Dr Guerrero has traveled to Honduras Ecuador Mexico and other Latin American countries to give his prescription data collection and analysis and the reform of courts and police He also calls for investing in peopleOne program Youth Without Borders plucks willing young men from gangs for a chance at a safer workaday life through job training and therapy Whats different between us and other programs in other cities is we do oneonone followups said Fausto Prieto 40 who coordinates neighborhood case workers Every case worker has to be on top of each kid day to dayCity workers organize six or seven hours of programs each day and the instruction can stretch for as long as two years or more Calis violence share two causes said Andres Villamizar the citys secretary of securitytoo little opportunity and too little authority If you ask me what works in Cali if its the iron fist or social policies I think neither of the two separately Mr Villamizar said You have to have both Its naive to think that just with social investment youll solve the problem just as its naive to think that with more police and army youll resolve itPolice had in the past focused on the number of arrests They now target the citys most murderous groups and individuals Special teams of detectives this year dismantled 45

reports of progress and setbacks among the 1200 former gang members they are trying to help said Maria Isabel Gutierrez an epidemiologist who heads the programWhen a young man is at risk of quitting the program or is in trouble the Cisalva team spends more time in his neighborhood To keep tabs Cisalva has a staff of 156 people including 35 community police officersabout one for every eight men in the programOne goal is to prepare them for city jobs such as the public bus system or garbage collection positions that pay 40 above the minimum wageOur style of life changed The way we dress the way we talk said Yiminson Sanchez 25 who got a hospital job through the help of case workers Wilson Muoz 45 is an outreach worker assigned to keep 17 young men from returning to gang violence and drugdealing After four months in the program Mr Muoz said about 10 of them are fully committedEscaping the lure and protection of gangs is complicated for youths in neighborhoods where crossing from one street to the next presents the danger of entering the territory of a rival gangBut there are enough men who want to succeed to keep the program alive including William Bedoya The former gang member now operates a small barber shop in his living room He wants to support his 8yearold son He is realistic about his lifes transformation This isnt going to happen from one day to the next he

16:42:00,Brian SchwartzSen Elizabeth Warren is closing her joint fundraising committee as she urges fellow Democratic candidates for president to reject money from political action committeesThe commitment to shut down the committee comes after Warren told MSNBCs Rachel Maddow that she believes people running for the partys nomination in 2020 should avoid funding their campaigns through PACsWarren also called on billionaires who might run for president such as Mike Bloomberg and Tom Steyer to avoid selffunding their campaignsSen Elizabeth Warren is following her own advice to fellow Democrats about rejecting money from political action committees to help fund their campaigns in the 2020 presidential electionWarren a liberal from Massachusetts is closing her joint fundraising committee the Elizabeth Warren Action Fund as she explores a run for the White House according to her chief spokeswoman Kristen OrthmanWe are in process of winding down Action Fund Orthman said in an emailThe commitment to shut down the fund comes after Warren told MSNBCs Rachel Maddow on Wednesday that she believes candidates running for the partys nomination should avoid funding their campaigns through PACsShe also said billionaires running for president should not selffund their campaignsI just mean that people should not be selffunding and they should not be funded from PACs from other billionaires Warren said urging candidates to use the primary process to get in touch with grassroots voters and activists Get out there trust your messageHer call for billionaires not to selffund campaign operations follows CNBCs reporting that Democratic donor and former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg was prepared to spend over 100 million on his own campaign organization if he were to run in 2020 Tom Steyer a liberal billionaire from California is also considering a run for president and will travel to the early caucus and primary states of Iowa New Hampshire and Nevada early this yearThe Iowa Caucuses kick off the election season a year from now but candidates are expected to announce their bids over the next several weeks Democratic presidential candidates will start debating each other later this yearOthers who are considering running include former Vice President Joe Biden Texas Rep Beto ORourke and Sens Kamala Harris and Cory BookerThe move by Warren to close her joint fundraising committee is significant in two waysOn one hand it means that Warren is likely limiting her ability to turn to big donors to help bolster her campaign if she were to officially jump into the race The committee raised 49 million during Warrens 2018 Senate reelection campaign according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics It transferred 36 million to Warrens official campaign for Senate which ended up raising 25 million and finished with 125 million on handThe PACs top donors ranged from investment bankers to attorneys across the United States Henry Goldberg chairman of investment and asset management firm Artery Capital Group LLC donated 15400 in August according to a Federal Election Commission filing Employees at class action and civil litigation law firm Berger Montague combined to give 35800However Warrens attempt to distance herself from the PAC is the latest example of her attempt to appeal to the liberal smalldonor base of the Democratic Party which historically has been against candidates turning to megadonors to influence their campaignsThe issue was a major factor in one of the mostwatched races of 2018 In deepred Texas ORourke made a point of shunning corporate donations and outside money as he nearly upset GOP Sen Ted Cruz ORourke still broke fundraising records as he raised over 80 million during the campaign A large chunk of that sum 36 million came from small donors or people who gave 200 or lessDuring the 2016 election liberal Sen Bernie Sanders of Vermont followed through with his promise of not accepting contributions from corporations Part of his platform was focused on campaign finance reformWhile Sanders did win a number of state primaries he ended up losing the nomination to Hillary Clinton If he

teaches a course on World War I at Purdue University where he is president and loves to talk about Woodrow Wilson Wilson left the presidency of Princeton in 1910 and was elected governor of New Jersey the next yearsort of the opposite of the thing I did says Mr Daniels who served two terms as Indianas governor 200513 before taking his current job on campus Explaining his decision to abandon the academy for a statehouse Wilson said I cant take the politics anymore Ive just asked Mr Danielswho unlike Wilson a century earlier decided against seeking the US presidency in 2012how running a university differs from running a state The silvertongued Mr Daniels offers a quip that must play well at the meetandgreets that clog up a college presidents calendar I use an old line he says without missing a beat which is that in my last job it was dogeatdog and here its just the opposite Mr Daniels 69 is the most innovative university president in America Like his counterparts at other schools he believes higher education has been a competitive advantage for the USa nice little export industry if you add up all the dollars that come here to purchase the education of students from other places He regards the rumbling in Washington about curbing visas for foreign students to be very shortsighted But he also thinks American higher education has grown fat and complacent Hes making inventive even radical changes in the way his institution finances itself and imparts an education Mr Daniels kicks off our conversation with a morality tale Ill speak to an audience of businesspeople and say Heres the racket that you should have gone into Youre selling something a college diploma thats deemed a necessity And you have total pricing power Better than that When you raise your prices you not only dont lose customers you may actually attract new ones For lack of objective measures people associate the sticker price with quality If school A costs more than B I guess its a better school A thirdparty payer the government funds it all so that the customerthat is the student and the familyfeels insulated against the cost A perfect formula for complacency The parallels with health care he observes are smack on Mr Daniels takes a different approach In 200103 he ran the White House budget office for President George W Bush who dubbed him The Blade for his costcutting skills Mr Daniels brought his paring knife to Purdue Examples of his efficiencies include replacing fulltime dininghall employees with student workers scrapping the vast fleet of universityowned buses in favor of a private contractor and saving 61 million on capital projects through what the university calls innovative construction management His most eyecatching achievement has been to keep costs down for students By graduation day in 2020 tuition wont have risen in eight years Were able to say he says that the total cost in nominal dollars of going to Purdue will be less in 2020 than it was in 2012 Mr Daniels says widespread adoption of Purdues affordability campaign would improve higher education Everybody is worried he says furrowing his brow What are we at A trillion and a half of student debt twice as much as the total creditcard debt Its a social and economic problem He offers up a list of lifes milestones that people delay because of college debt marriage household formation child raising homeownership businessstart formationall of these things are being pressed down by college debt The obvious first step Mr Daniels replies is dont charge so darn much in the first place Yet he is notably reticent about encouraging other institutions to follow his lead It feels as though not a week goes by when theres not an invitation to go talk about the subject to somebodys board of trustees or state regents he says Ive turned down every one of those We dontI dontproselytize We dont assert that anything weve done here fits any school but ours Even so hes happy to explain how he did it When he arrived at Purdue in January 2013 the university had raised tuition 36 years in a rowtypical for American higher ed where an increase in tuition was just considered an annual rite of spring Mr Daniels suggested a oneyear pause to indicate some sensitivity to what was a growing concern about the cost of it all He feared Purdue would pay a price in the perverse marketplace if it didnt raise tuition which goes up annually across the nation by 2 to 3 Instead he was pleasantly surprised to find his school in a position of differentiationwhat every marketer hopes for Purdue acquired a reputation as a place where youre less likely to get socked with an annual surprise In consequence it has had record applications from higher and higherquality students Other costs such as room and board have also been held constant and the price of textbooks has fallen by about 30 A duopoly of two large bookstores had owned the market at Purdue Mr Daniels says We invited Amazon onto campus and they set up their first bricksandmortar facilities anywhere Another innovation introduced in 2016 is the Income Share Agreement an alternative to traditional student loans under which a student receives funding for his education in exchange for a percentage of income for up to 10 years after graduation Like many modern economic innovations the idea had its origins in a paper by Milton Friedman published in 1955 Friedman asked why it shouldnt be possible for an investor to buy a share in a students earning prospects Under Purdues version of the agreement credit is extended to students by a universityaffiliated nonprofit and is available to all majors and all classes except freshmen Students dont owe anything while at university for a sixmonth grace period thereafterand after graduation if theyre unemployed or earn less than 20000 a year The total repayment is capped at 25 times the principal The Income Share Agreement Mr Daniels says isnt a substitute for heavily subsidized loansyou cant beat those But its a pretty good one for the expensive loans that many students have to layer on I always say think of it as working your way through school after you leave after you get the degree Critics call it a form of indenture but Mr Daniels says they have it absolutely backwards If you want indentured servitude he bridles look at the government loan program You cant even get out in bankruptcy The debt compounds year on year Whether life goes well or not you still owe exactly the same amount In the case of the studynowpaylater contracts if something goes wrong or life goes poorly you owe nothing or very little Mr Danielss dog eat dog quip doesnt describe the atmosphere on Purdues campus Its a happy place and the Boilermakers still glow from their epic football defeat of Ohio State in late October He is a popular and accessible president who uses the treadmill in the student gym and sits amid ordinary fans at football games Theres a trope at every gameWheres Mitchin which the camera pans across the crowd to find the president in the stands The one great source of turbulence during Mr Danielss tenure may prove his most successful innovation In a bold move for a public university Purdue in 2017 purchased Kaplan University an online forprofit distancelearning institution It was relaunched this year as a nonprofit Purdue University Global after Mr Daniels overcame bitter resistance from some professors who feared a dilution in the quality of a Purdue education In November 2017 more than 300 faculty members signed a petition opposing the deal citing concerns about academic standards integrity and freedom Mr Daniels says he has won over most of his critics There are far more faculty who are looking to see if theres a program that they could originate for Purdue Global Its taken a while but our faculty have come to understand the importance of our mission here The online university now enrolls 29000 students Its aim is to serve working adults nationwide who wish to complete college degrees but dont have the time or geographical proximity to enroll in ordinary classes Expanding access to education Mr Daniels says is in the genetic code of this placeits just who we are He sees it as a successor of the two great domestic educational policy achievements of Americas first 250 yearsthe GI Bill of 1944 which helped World War II veterans go to college and the Morrill Act of 1862 The latter established landgrant universities including Purdue on federal land across rural America to focus on agriculture and the mechanic arts The aim bring education to citizens who didnt have easy access Today there are 35 to 40 million Americans by most counts who started college and didnt finish Mr Daniels says Were not talking about people who stopped at high school but those who went and spent some moneyprobably borrowed some moneyand then didnt complete a degree There are twice as many of them as all the 18 to 24yearolds in America They suffer economically for want of a degree In this economy in this world getting those people a credential is enormously important especially to a society which keeps wringing its hands about the quality of its workforce In his ambition the typical student at Purdue Global is a 33yearold working adultmuch more likely to be a woman and as likely as that to be a minorityprobably with family obligations The acquisition of Kaplan was as he puts it a matter of kismet Mr Daniels was determined to enhance Purdues online educational offerings but frustrated by his inability to do so Every year between Christmas and New Years Day I write a little selfevaluation and give it to the board he says Three years in a row the worst grade I gave myself was for online education Purdue faced a makeorbuy decision Should we invest and build an online presence internally or should we try to acquire it In early 2017 a common friend connected Mr Daniels to Donald Graham chairman of the Graham Holdings Co which had sold the Washington Post to Jeff Bezos in 2013 and still owned Kaplan University Don called me Mr Daniels recalls and he said to me This will probably be the shortest call of your day but I dont suppose by any chance you want to buy Kaplan Fifteen minutes later we had a deal Next year marks Purdues 150th anniversary and the university is commemorating the occasion with a lecture series 150 Years of Giant Leaps The title is inspired by Neil Armstrong Purdues most famous alumnus who visited the moon during the universitys centennial year Purdue boasts two dozen astronauts among its alumni more than any other universityincluding the last man on the moon Eugene Cernan as well as the first Mr Daniels for his part likes it here on Earth especially in his own small corner of Indiana In April this year Purdues trustees approved an extension to his contract that allows him to serve indefinitely requiring either party to give one years notice They sold it as a reward for his innovations Mr Daniels sees these innovations as small steps for Purdue But if others were to follow some of his ways we could well have a giant leap for American higher education Mr Varadarajan is executive editor at Stanford Universitys Hoover Institution Correction An earlier version of this article misstated the enrollment at Purdue University Global

Latin America particularly in Brazil the apps secondlargest market I think its safe to say its pretty important for us to launch payments in India said one person close to WhatsApp The economic opportunity for mobile payments in India is huge there are more than 1bn mobile phone users in the country and the digital payments market led by mobile will grow to 1tn by 2023 according to a report by Credit SuisseWhen Prime Minister Narendra Modi removed 86 per cent of Indias cash from circulation in November 2016 Indian mobile wallet company Paytm was one of the big winners The company added 20m users in just five weeks after the shock announcement But just a month later Mr Modi was urging citizens to use UPI a groundbreaking payments system that presented a threat to Paytm Created by the NPCI a joint venture among Indian banks the technology dramatically lowered the barriers to entry for payments app developers It also removed the need for consumers to keep money in a separate virtual wallet as with Paytms main service or with Alipay and WeChat Pay in China Google was the first big foreign company to jump on the UPI platform launching its payments app Tez in September 2017 It claims to have amassed 16m users helping to spur rapid growth in UPI transactions which reached 28bn in February compared with 534m using Paytms virtual wallet and other prepaid instruments But analysts say WhatsApp will be a bigger threat to Paytm and others entering the payments businessBased on my knowledge of the payments system in India over the last 10 years WhatsApp Pay will be viral said Ram Rastogi an architect of the UPI system in India and former employee of the NPCI Indians want something they are used to in a language they can read and write in WhatsApps willingness to provide services in 13 major languages in India can play a vital role in taking digitisation of payments even to villagesLast month UPI facilitated 520m transactions a figure growing by 10 per cent each month Within six months of full launch WhatsApp can easily reach 100m to 150m monthly transactions which is a similar rate to what Google has seen here Mr Rastogi said The average value of a transaction via UPI is Rs1000 which could add up to Rs150bn 2bn flowing through WhatsApp every month The company has insisted that it does not have plans to take a cut of transactions from banks but every bank that connects to WhatsApp via UPI is obliged to pay a flat fee of Rs05 to Rs15 per transaction for peertopeer transactions according to UPI rules Twohundred million people with WhatsApp connections means that even one transaction a day will give them Rs100m daily Mr Rastogi said The other thing is once you do this volume of transactions you can start analysing transactions Thats the big opportunity This trove of payments data could help Facebook and WhatsApp raise the fees they charged to advertisers analysts said If they see who youre paying it helps them to target your ads so it makes you much more valuable to their advertisers said David Birch director of payments consultancy Hyperion and a digital money analyst If WhatsApp can see that youre paying a gym once a month that data could be used by Facebook to target you across its other platforms Also if I see youre spending a lot I can start targeting you with direct messages from financial services which makes you more valuable too Companies with large amounts of user transaction data could also start providing lateral services They could make basic services like transferring money internationally free overnight as a way to grow loyalty and access ever more data said Mark Tluszcz chief executive of Mangrove Capital Partners a venture capital company based in LuxembourgOver the past year Facebook has aggressively started to monetise its chat apps such as Messenger through ads It also sells access to its interface to big brands on both Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp which it acquired for 218bn in 2014 In India WhatsApp is already charging large businesses such as airlines and ecommerce sites a fixed rate of between 05 and 9 US cents per message a premium to SMS to contact customers through WhatsApp Although WhatsApp Pay is pitched as a peertopeer payments system more than 80 per cent of small businesses in India and Brazil say they already use WhatsApp to conduct business Facilitating retail payments via the app is an obvious next step a source close to WhatsApp acknowledgedToday almost 1m people are testing WhatsApp payments in India The feedback has been very positive and people enjoy the convenience of sending money as simply and securely as sending messages said Anne Yeh from WhatsApp Were working closely with the Indian government NPCI and multiple banks including our

registered its shares under the stock ticker P2PBut even P2P Global Investments the first investment fund dedicated to the sector when it launched in 2014 admits the initial frenzy of interest has died downIt is considering changing its name because it no longer accurately reflects the funds interests People may have to work too hard to figure out what we do said Lindsey McMurray managing director of Pollen Street Capital which took over management of P2PGI last yearIn the years after the financial crisis investors and politicians enthused about the new crop of peertopeer providers which promised to upend the lending market while providing a better return for savers These groups were set up to enable consumers to lend to each other and small businesses directly through websites effectively cutting out the big banks As the sheen around the sector has dulled however and some of the smaller providers have run into trouble many groups have changed focusThis month Zopa the original peertopeer lender which launched in the UK 13 years ago became the first of its kind to be awarded a full UK banking licence allowing it to offer traditional products such as fixedterm savings accounts Recently listed Funding Circle announced its largest commitment from an institutional investor to fund loans through its platformJaidev Janardana chief executive of Zopa stressed that peertopeer funding would keep growing in absolute terms but said it would become a relatively less important part of the companys business over time We think of ourselves as a financial services company Yes a peertopeer business is a part of it but it is only one part he saidMs McMurray said investors overfocused on the backend bit saying this money goes from one peer to another But the core competence is the ability to underwrite credit and deliver good frontend applications and smooth customer journeys none of those things are different from any other lenderShe still believes opportunities exist for specialist and techdriven lenders in areas where mainstream banks struggle to meet demand she said However P2PGI now works with very few of the highprofile platforms that connect retail investors with companies or individuals looking for loansMike Bristow chief executive of property lender CrowdProperty suggested that some companies have tried to take advantage of the hype around peertopeer without making effective business plans We said were brilliant at property lets apply that with a peertopeer funding model Whereas certain companies just started with peertopeer and looked for an asset class to fund with itThe Financial Conduct Authority has raised concerns about the peertopeer sector after finding that a fifth of investors had put more than double their annual income into platforms that often failed to fully explain the risks involved It is consulting on changes that would make it much harder for regular retail investors to fund loansIn its submission to the FCAs review Zopa argued that a firm that exposes investors to prime consumer loans with target returns of 45 per cent should not face the same rules as a company that advertises a 12 per cent return through shortterm property loansA recent crisis at Lendy a peertopeer lender that specialises in property development finance and the collapse in March of Manchesterbased Collateral which was operating without a licence drew further negative attention to the sector just as companies were fighting to prove they are not too risky for retail investorsThe Financial Times first reported in October that Lendy was fighting legal claims from one of its biggest borrowers who had threatened to sue the company and many of its investorsAn FT analysis of Lendys loan book showed that more than twothirds of its outstanding loans were past due The company which originally lent against marine assets before expanding into property considered selling its loans to distressed debt investors This month it overhauled its leadership team and said it would make changes to almost every area of its business including governance financial controls liquidity collections and complianceIn an update to investors before Christmas the company acknowledged that a number of its loans would not be fully repaid raising the prospect of investors losing up to tens of millions of poundsExecutives at rival lenders say Lendys problems do not reflect an inherent weakness in the industry but are concerned they could still have a knockon effect on other providersThe FCA have got to do what theyve got to do theyre obviously concerned and theyve got to protect the investors said the chief executive of another lender that funds entirely through retail investors What worries me is if they use this as an excuse to take the easy way out and just crack down on everyone

economies have fallen markedly,https://www.ft.com/content/4bb70360-ffaa-11e8-aebf-99e208d3e521,2018-12-16 18:11:09,UK asset markets have remained fairly calm in the face of political uncertainty surrounding Brexit Sterling has weakened only slightly since the initial devaluation after the referendum in 2016 And UK equities have fallen 7 per cent this year compared with a drop of 3 per cent in global equities in local currencies So while there have been recent wobbles there has been no crash in asset prices to rival the great British economic crises of past decades such as the 1976 IMF crisis the 1992 European Exchange Rate Mechanism meltdown or the 2008 financial crash However there is one important exception the market in future UK inflation rates see box below Without wishing to join the scaremongering of Project Fear it is undeniable that this market has shown significant increases in concern about inflation risks This is how the threeyear ahead UK inflation swap has moved since the referendum on EU membership in 2016 compared with the same inflation swaps in the US and the eurozone The equilibrium price for the UK inflation rate over the next three years jumped by a full percentage point in the months around the referendum in June 2016 as the market absorbed the inflationary impact of the 20 per cent devaluation in sterling The inflation swap rate then fell slightly as a soft Brexit appeared probable in 2017 but it has risen by about 06 per cent since March 2018 Although the rise in inflation swaps this year appears limited it has occurred at a time when inflation swaps in other major economies have fallen markedly because oil prices have crashed There has therefore been a sharp divergence between UK inflation markets and the global norm For example compared with the US the forward UK inflation rate has risen by 08 per cent since last summer Why has the inflation picture in the UK worsened so dramatically compared with that in other countries in recent months The first point to note is that the rise in inflation swaps is greater than the increase in consensus economic forecasts for UK inflation over the same period By definition therefore the change in the UK has been caused by an increase in the inflation risk premium not by a change in the central expectation for UK inflation The markets are becoming increasingly concerned about the tail risk of much higher inflation There may be several reasons why this tail risk has risen so much Investors may be worried that a cliffedge Brexit would trigger a further sterling devaluation at a time when the UK labour market is extremely tight and wage inflation is above the rate consistent with the 2 per cent inflation target The combination of higher import prices and higher wages looks much more threatening than it did in 2016 UK inflation expectations are not as well anchored as they are in the US the eurozone and Japan In part this is because there have been several episodes of a high inflation rate in Britain in the recent past Another factor is that the Bank of Englands inflation credibility is not as well established as that in some other advanced economies The Treasury can easily change the banks inflation target in a letter to its governor without any need for complex amendments to legislation In a severe recession which the bank believes could follow a very hard Brexit it is quite likely that politicians may raise the UK inflation target in order to force monetary policy to stabilise output for a temporary period A hard Brexit could also cause problems for public borrowing and fiscal sustainability in the UK Following repeated postponements in fiscal targets at any sign of an economic slowdown since 2010 the markets would expect the Treasury to tolerate much longer period of rising debt ratios in order to cushion a Brexitrelated recession A relaxation in fiscal discipline when confidence in sterling is already under strain could further undermine the authorities inflation credibility Conclusion The UKs constitutional crisis has not yet developed into an economic or financial crisis But inflation risk is now rising partly because the markets are increasingly concerned about a cliffedge Brexit and partly because the macroeconomic policy framework and the tight labour market are adding to the consequent risks The inflation market is the appropriate place to follow the markets assessment of these combined risks Market prices are very pessimistic discounting a more disruptive outcome for Brexit and macro policy than at any time since the referendum This may eventually prove to be an overshoot but it should be a serious concern for the banks Monetary Policy Committee when it gathers on Thursday for its final meeting of the year Markets in future UK inflation There are two main ways in which investors can take positions that reflect the future rate of inflation in the UK In the gilts market the difference between conventional bond yields and real yields in the indexlinked market provides a measure of breakeven inflation measured by the retail price index In the swaps market investors can go directly long or short of RPI inflation rates so the price that emerges in the market reflects the equilibrium that brings inflation optimists and pessimists into balance Because of technical differences between these two markets implied future inflation rates can differ but they tend to move broadly together over time In both markets the clearing price for inflation can be defined as the markets central expectation for future inflation over the relevant period plus or minus a risk premium If the market price for inflation changes while consensus economic forecasts for inflation remain constant then by definition the risk premium demanded by investors to clear the market has changed This is what has happened recently Note Fulcrum Asset Management LLP and its affiliates officers directors partners and employees will

bites,https://www.ft.com/content/1b37721e-100e-11e9-a3aa-118c761d2745,2019-01-04 13:23:46,Apples chief executive had some bad newsLike others in our industry we are experiencing a slowdown in sales this quarter he told investors as Apple fell short of its revenue projections by some 10 per centBut he added Weve got some amazing new products in development so were excited about the year aheadThat was 2002 and Steve Jobs launched the iPod less than a year earlier Back then Apple was embarking on a remarkable wave of innovations that would culminate in one of the most lucrative consumer products of all time the iPhone But this week after Jobs successor Tim Cook issued a similar warning investors are now wondering what can possibly follow peak iPhoneMr Cooks 1400word letter to investors was long on excuses but lacked the pithy promise of an imminent return to form that Jobs 72word statement did 16 years ago the last time Apple issued such an intraquarter bombshellIts easy being Apple CEO when everything is going right and firing on all cylinders This is the time we will see Tim Cook really be testedMichael Gartenberg former director of marketing at AppleWe are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services Mr Cook wrote Apple innovates like no other company on earth and we are not taking our foot off the gasHow Mr Cook and his team respond to the iPhones current crisis will reveal exactly what kind of business Apple is becoming as it approaches its 43rd birthdayIs the company that hired the former chiefs of Burberry and Yves Saint Laurent really a fashion brand selling affordable luxury but subject to the whims of fickle consumers Can it turn its services business which generated 108bn in revenues in the past quarter into a new engine of growth in a transformation similar to the one that propelled Microsoft to supplant Apple as the worlds most valuable companyOr is it just another hardware company such as Nokia or BlackBerry as naysayers have long predictedThis is going to be Tim Cooks defining moment as CEO said Michael Gartenberg a former director of marketing at Apple who now works as an independent tech analyst Its easy being Apple CEO when everything is going right and firing on all cylinders This is the time we will see Tim Cook really be testedHuge change in the smartphone marketThe dotcom bust turned out to be a profitable period for Apple thanks to the iPod and from 2003 the iTunes Store Those hits fuelled the development of the iPhone which also launched into an economic downturn in 2007If there is a world recession Apple has been very resilient through those times said one former longserving Apple managerBut he added that this weeks warning nevertheless marked a huge change as the smartphone market braces for its first global downturnDespite many of Apples suppliers warning of cutbacks and waning smartphone demand it seems like Apple had their head in the ground the former manager said What surprised me more was that they werent ahead of thisWhile Mr Cook and his key deputies Phil Schiller and Eddy Cue have lived through Apples previous ups and downs Mr Cook joined the company two decades ago the vast majority of Apples rankandfile employees as well as about half of its executive team have only ever experienced the breakneck growth of the iPhone eraBefore the iPhone launched Apple had 17787 employees according to regulatory filings from late 2006 Apples headcount now stands at 132000 doubling even since 2012Another Apple veteran said the vast majority of Apples staff had never seen struggle or conflictSteve Jobs always used to say recessions are great time to invest in RampD they added Most companies cut backEven with revenues set to decline by around 5 per cent in the crucial December quarter Apples RampD budget continued to soar last year climbing 23 per cent yearonyear to 142bn more than twice its spend in 2014Some of those resources are going into forthcoming products including autonomous cars smart glasses and new entertainment services The company recently hired former Tesla designer Andrew Kim and Oculus VR producer Dorian Dargan underscoring its continuing ambitions in transportation and immersive computing A new original video service to rival Netflix is expected to debut within just a few monthsAnd Apples huge RampD investment has already produced new successes such as the Apple Watch and AirPods sales of which grew by almost 50 per cent in the past quarterBut it will take time to develop any new product into a meaningful business at least by the iPhones outsized standardsIt would be nice to see an unveiling of a brand new Apple product that has people lining up outside Apple stores days in advance but it doesnt look like anything like that is on the horizon Mr Gartenberg saidThe end of the golden eraSeven years into his tenure as chief executive Mr Cook can claim several meaningful milestones including briefly turning Apple into the first trilliondollar company But he has not succeeded in lessening Apples dependence on the iPhone arguably reflecting a misplaced bet that the smartphone could generate even more revenues through higher prices even as absolute volume growth slowedIn February 2015 revelling in the huge success of the iPhone 6 and on the day it became the first US company to exceed a market capitalisation of 700bn Mr Cook told a Goldman Sachs investor conference We dont believe in such laws as laws of large numbersBut the old dogma seems to be catching up with Apple as it struggles to convince customers to pay upwards of 1000 for a new iPhone Critics say the current lineup is both expensive and confusing with too little differentiation between the 750 iPhone XR and 1000 XS Yet overtly cutting prices risks hurting Apples premium brand positioning and is likely to push the company to explore more creative ways to promote its devices such as annual subscriptions or bundling its hardware with subscriptions to services such as Apple MusicInvestors concerns that Apple may never find a real successor to the iPhone sent its shares tumbling by 10 per cent on Thursday its worst oneday performance in five years and leaving Apple valued at 675bn less than Microsoft Amazon and Alphabet In a matter of months it has shed about 400bn of market capitalisation more than Facebooks entire valuationSome analysts have even compared Apples situation to that of Nokia the former mobile market leader that was so thoroughly disrupted by the iPhoneIn a research note on Thursday that warned of the potential for further downside to sales estimates this year Goldman Sachs pointed out that Nokia saw a rapid expansion of replacement rates in late 2007 similar to the trend Apple is now experiencing of some customers holding on to their existing iPhones for three or four yearsRichard Windsor an independent mobile analyst said Nokia discovered between 2003 and 2006 that when a consumer device market matures it becomes very unpredictable which is exactly what I think is going on hereBut he added I do not in any way think that this represents Apples Nokia moment simply because there is still nothing to seriously challenge the iPhone in the highend segmentWhat comes after the smartphone remains an open question for Apple and the entire device industry as it prepares to gather in Las Vegas next week for the Consumer Electronics ShowBut just as it would have been foolish to write off Apple in 2002 some observers still see potential for another comebackIf ever there was a team that could deal with these issues and go forward I think its the team that is in place said Mr Gartenberg The question is is this still the golden era of Apple or is it going to become just another technology company

competition,https://www.ft.com/content/5132f11e-0f4f-11e9-a3aa-118c761d2745,2019-01-04 05:00:25,No matter how sophisticated the world of investing becomes it is hard to beat the allure of stock pickingThe idea of testing your mettle against the market is deeply ingrained in the popular consciousness of investment as any Financial Times journalist who has ever introduced themselves to someone new at a party can attest Upon learning your profession the question almost invariably follows What stocks should I invest in I find it hard not to share the sense of disappointment after I explain that I mainly write about something called the corporate bond marketBut to capture some of this thrill in a safe setting and hopefully make us all better conversationalists at parties the FT team has for the past few years held a charity stock picking contest Excitingly for the first time this year readers can join inThe rules are simple Contestants have to choose five stocks listed anywhere in the world that they think will achieve the highest percentage return that year They can take either a long or short position betting that the shares will either rise or fallThe portfolios are equally weighted and have no base currency meaning foreign exchange movements have no effect on the end result and dividends do not contribute to the returns To enter the journalists have to donate to the FT Seasonal Appeal this year we are supporting the charity Habitat for Humanity the largest nonprofit housebuilder in the world RecommendedThe FTs Miles Johnson who usually oversees the contest has recently left the frantic and fickle world of market reporting behind for the relative tranquility of covering Italian politics And so this year the task of administering proceedings has fallen to meBefore setting out how you can enter the 2019 competition let me reveal the results of last years contest Are there any lessons we can learn Charity stock picking tends to bring out the punter in everyone A oneyear horizon flies against advice to invest for the long term And with no real money at stake other than wounded pride there is no real downside to doing badly As there is little glory in a midtable finish players tend to try to shoot for the moon with allornothing betsRather than the sleepatnight names typically held by mainstream fund managers the portfolios of the 20 FT scribes who took part in 2018 were chock full of high octane picks such as Greek banks oilfield services companies and the occasional obscure penny stockThere are still some lessons to be learnt in these punts however The first is that just because a stock has gone down a lot it doesnt mean it will bounce backMean reversion might be a great concept to bear in mind when examining markets as a whole but if a company is in deep trouble the fact its stock has dropped 90 per cent doesnt mean it cannot fall a further 100 per cent to zero The nameless FT stock picker who went long Carillion learnt this lesson the hard wayIt is also unsurprising that in a year that saw most major bourses finish in the red most of the topperforming portfolios were powered by clever short picks The seemingly hapless Carillion punter actually ended up as one of the nine out of 20 contestants that finished the year with positive returns powered by several shrewd short calls including UK retailers Carpetright and Sports Direct I suspect that this years entries will be dominated by short selling doomsayers Our contestants of course do not have to contend with the tricky and often costly mechanics that short sellers face when having to borrow shares Dividends another cost the shorter has to bear in the real world are not factored inThis ability to take advantage of loopholes in the simplified rules of our competition strongly aided last years winning entryJohannesburgbased FT correspondent Joseph Cotterill was confident that a hyperinflation scare in Zimbabwe would push locals to panic buy certain stocks This powered large listed brewer Delta Corporation to rise more than 87 per cent Trying to replicate this in the real world would be a pretty fruitless endeavour however due to the extreme difficulty of repatriating cash from the African countryThe best real world investment advice is almost certainly to steadily drip your money into simple and lowcost index funds whilst ignoring the daily gyrations of markets But taking this approach would make for rather a boring competition As such ETFs and other listed instruments that provide exposure to a diversified basket of assets have always been outlawed for our stock pickersThats not to say that all exchangetraded instruments are safe and straightforward Last year one spoilsport refused to take part unless they could pick a few exchange traded funds Out of their five picks two were complicated inversevolatility products that blew up barely one month into the contest The US markets editor involved shall remain nameless to avoid embarrassment ahem More than 20 FT reporters have made their picks for the 2019 contest but to make things more exciting this year were offering FT readers a chance to best us Following this link ftcomstockpicker will take you to our website where you can enter with your own five picks For readers the deadline is Monday January 15 which will be counted as the start date If youd like to join us and make a donation to Habitat for Humanity the link is on the form The three best reader entries of 2019 will be invited into the FTs new offices in Bracken House next year for a reward that

bull market whose durability has exceeded all others lurched within a few points of its demise on Christmas Eve extending one of the roughest stretches for equities since the financial crisisBy the thinnest of margins the SampP 500 was spared its first 20 percent decline since 2009 a period that spans two presidential administrations and three Federal Reserve chairs Investors hoping for a respite from volatility before the break got yet another powerful dose as the equity selloff that has defied every hope of ending showed itself no respecter of holiday cheerAt the end of Mondays mercifully abbreviated session the benchmark gauge for American equities sat at 235110 down 198 percent from its Sept 20 close and just seven points from the bear market threshold Compared with its intraday high on Sept 21 the gauge is down 20 percent The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 16 percent to end 12 percent above a bearEven if 20 percent is just a psychological number it is psychologically very important Chris Zaccarelli chief investment officer at the Independent Advisor Alliance said by phone Weve been trading like were already in a bear market for the past few weeks I dont know if it would create panic but if we break below the 23445 level that would be very unsettlingWith every big lurch  and there have been a lot lately the average oneday decline in the SampP 500 this month is 16 percent  markets move closer to becoming more than just a problem for investors but a drag on the economy itself In testimony last week Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated he didnt see the slump as meaning much for the economy though the Dow was about 1500 points higher than it is now when he was speakingThe markets going down will eventually create an economic problem said Ernesto Ramos head of equities at BMO Asset Management Were not there yet but getting pretty close People who spend money as consumers if they have stock exposure theyre reconsidering if theyre going to buy a 1000 present  theyll buy a 200 oneNewspapers are headlining market drops the worst month since 2008 or worst week since 2008 Ramos said All of these headlines are in the front Theyre not buried in some back page Theyre seeing the market is taking a hit and their 401k is tied to itWhile a dozen things have been blamed for the plunge  slowing growth trade tariffs stretched valuations Brexit  its latest segment has come amid increasingly frantic emanations from the Donald Trump White House Over the weekend Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had to reassure markets that the president has no plans to fire Powell after Bloomberg reported Trump had discussed the step repeatedly in recent daysMnuchin took to Twitter again on Sunday to say hed spoken to heads of the biggest US banks about liquidity and lending infrastructure and reconvened a presidential working group established to sort out the Crash of 1987 While equities have never needed an obvious reason to fall over three months of tumult its safe to say that neither gesture steadied the decline Neither did a fresh tweet Monday from Trump blasting the FedFor investors who thought theyd spend 2018 basking in the tidings of Trumps tax overhaul the slide has been particularly brutal Little in the economy seems to justify such a steep decline  a danger of ascribing too much causeandeffect to equity prices The CBOE Volatility Average which started the year at 1104 surged Monday to 3607Going through the whole month of January everything was still allsystems go hunky dory sotospeak But then once the president brought up the tariffs and a trade war then the entire global economy kind of lost a significant amount of steam said Scot Lance managing director at Californiabased Titus Wealth Management Its ironic that weve come to this bear market or a potential one  I dont see how its stoppable frankly  but its kind of unprecedented how we haveWhile both earnings and the economy are forecast to slow next year neither is anywhere near a full blown decline At 173 a share consensus estimates for SampP 500 earnings in 2019 are down marginally from a few months ago but still represent an increase of 35 percent from last year  not the sort of profit performance usually associated with big declines in equitiesThe apparent calm in the economy and Corporate America is a bitter irony for bulls with a sense of history considering some of the things that failed to torpedo the decadelong rally in the past There was the stripping of the US governments AAA credit rating which led to one of the most volatile stretches ever recorded in August 2011 but no 20 percent plunge There was the May 2010 flash crash which knocked the Dow down as much as 92 percent in one dayOf all its traumas the closest the SampP 500 has ever been to a 20 percent closetoclose bear market plunge was from April 29 to Oct 3 in 2011 when headlines about Europes sovereign credit crisis pushed the benchmark within points of a formal bear market That decline ended with a onemonth 108 percent surge the best monthly return of the bull marketGoing back to the 1940s there have been 14 bear markets with half of them taking place during a recession according to LPL Research Those that came during an economic downturn were more painful the SampP 500 falling 37 percent on average while bear markets with no accompanying recession lost a lesser 24 percent at the trough on averageAs weve seen over the past 40 years if the economy is on firm footing bears tend to stop around a 20 percent loss and the occurrences of a massive drop are quite limited said Ryan Detrick PL senior market strategistVisit Bloomberg News at wwwbloombergcom

Lying prone in the car park was a 35metrelong replica of the Statue of LibertyHavans owner Brazilian businessman Luciano Hang has turned the statues into a group trademark similar lady liberties hold their torches aloft over his stores in malls across Latin Americas largest countryBut in Braslia the conservative entrepreneur who is a staunch supporter of Brazils presidentelect the farright politicianJair Bolsonaro was barred from erecting the statue because of local bylaws limiting the height of advertisingThe sort of red tape that grounded the replica was for Bolsonaro stalwarts a microcosm of the malaise that is afflicting Brazil With his appointment of Brazilian investor Paulo Guedes a PhD in economics from the University of Chicago as economic minister Mr Bolsonaro has pledged to end Brazils historic legacy of overbearing bureaucracy and usher in a more American style of capitalism when he assumes office on January 1The Brazilian state is broken So there is a historic opportunity to really move Brazil torwards a free market says Carlos Langoni a former central bank president Or as a supporter of Havans Mr Hang put it on Twitter referring to the upcoming inauguration President Bolsonaro will ascend the ramp and the statue will rise as wellYet for all the sound and fury of Octobers bitterly fought presidential election Mr Bolsonaro said little of substance during the campaign about what he intends to do on the economyKnown for his disparaging remarks about women and gay and black people as well as his defence of torturers from Brazils former military dictatorship the gruff former army captain used social media to exploit popular anger with a deep recession and corruption Many voters saw him as the antidote to the leftist Workers party or PT whose founder and former president Luiz Incio Lula da Silva was jailed for corruption earlier this yearSupport of farright former army captain Jair Bolsonaro hope he can restore the countrys economic fortunes  AFPMr Bolsonaro won over part of the business community with his one decisive act on economic policy the choice of Mr Guedes a toughtalking champion of liberal reformThis may be the first time we have a real chance of having capitalism in Brazil says Alfredo Vallado a Brazilian political scientist at Sciences Po in ParisSupporters hope Brazil can reemerge as one of the worlds most dynamic large economies with some economists predicting it could grow faster in 2019 for the first time in six years than Mexico Latin Americas other large economy which is shifting left under new president Andrs Manuel Lpez ObradorBalanced against these hopes however are questions over whether Mr Bolsonaro has the political skill to deliver such a transformation His coarse rhetoric may please loyalists on the farright but his ability to negotiate proposed reforms with the 30 parties in Brazils fractious congress or to deal with tough trade partners such as China and the US is untestedCritics say he did not pass a significant bill during his decades as a lawmaker during which time he regularly voted with the left to defend the interventionist policies and special privileges he now criticisesThe question is much more about the political capacity of the government to execute and define priorities than about the technical agenda says Marcos de Barros Lisboa an economist and president of the Insper business school in So PauloFor Kevin Gibson Latin America chief executive of recruitment consultancy Robert Walters the change in economic sentiment after the election victory of Mr Bolsonaro has been immediate Businesses have suddenly begun trying to recruit again after a long hiatus Companies believe the opportunities for growth are now far better and they want to beat

former PT government which presided over a collapse in gross domestic product of more than 7 percentage points between 2015 and 2016 big business was eager for a change analysts sayMr Bolsonaro has public support too According to a survey by polling company Ibope 64 per cent of Brazilians believe his government will be good or greatIn his favour is a cyclical economic recovery Analysts surveyed by the central bank are predicting growth in gross domestic product of 13 per cent this year and 25 per cent next year Inflation and the central banks benchmark Selic interest rate are subduedWe already have a cyclical recovery under way inflation is low the Selic is low and credit is recuperating says Leonardo Fonseca chief economist at Credit Suisse in So PauloThese benign tailwinds are creating the conditions to tackle Brazils fundamental challenges its ballooning fiscal bill and its excessive bureaucracy and taxes The governments budget deficit in 2018was about 7 per cent the central bank says This has raised gross public debt to 763 per cent high for a developing country particularly one with Brazils history of elevated interest ratesThe pension system allows many people to retire in their mid50s especially career public servants Last year pension expenditure consumed a third of the government budgetThe unpopular outgoing government of Michel Temer which took office after the 2016 impeachment of president Dilma Rousseff was unable to get even a watered down pension reform through congressWith his greater political capital Mr Bolsonaro should be able to pass at least Mr Temers diluted reform which sets a minimum retirement age for urban male workers of 65 years old and women of 62 years old analysts saidHowever the military and police his main constituents would likely oppose a stronger reform which would impact their own generous retirement systems He would also need a constitutional majority of threefifths of the lower house of congress to pass the measuresOther ambitious reforms include a long list of proposed privatisations streamlining the tax regime and opening up the economy by lowering tariffsThe argument usually used is that we need first to modernise the economy to be competitive then to open up says Mr Langoni I would say the opposite we need to first open up to be competitiveIf the pension reform passes companies may start to feel confident about investing again as they would have less reason to fear that high government debt levels would be met with increased inflation Most equity strategists expect the Ibovespa stock index to rally tooWe see greater room for Brazil to keep surprising to the upside and for Mexico to behave in an opposite fashion says UBS Global Wealth Management in a noteMr Guedes a 69yearold native of Rio de Janeiro describes his partnership with Mr Bolsonaro by referring to the words Order and Progress which are written on the Brazilian flag In Guedes telling Mr Bolsonaro represents order and the financier progressBrazilian protesters have rallied nationwide against proposed pension reforms  GettyMr Guedes has made marketfriendly appointments including fellow University of Chicago alumni Roberto Castello Branco as head of stateowned oil companyPetrobras and Joaquim Levy a former finance minister as head of Brazils influential development bankBNDES Rogrio Marinho an experienced congressmen was appointed special secretary for social welfareThe latest appointments in the ministries have been very good says Inspers Mr LisboaHowever there are a series of risks facing the new government They start with Mr Guedes himself He is under investigation over suspected fraud in dealings with stateowned pension funds allegations he has dismissedMr Guedes could also fall out with his tempestuous boss Mr Bolsonaro will come under intense pressure from erstwhile allies when he introduces pension and other reforms Oxford Economics says the second biggest downside risk for Latin America after a China slowdown is the possibility that Bolsonaro fires his orthodox finance minister and fails to deliver on his promised economic reformsThe other risk is political Mr Bolsonaro is pursuing a different way of doing politics in Braslia Instead of allotting ministries among allied parties in congress he has largely appointed technocrats and retired military officers to his cabinet He is also wooing individual congressmen directly analysts say rather than negotiating with party leaders who still wield power because of their control of election fundsIf congress turns hostile Mr Bolsonaro could go full Caesar and appeal directly to the people via social media on important reforms says Matias Spektor a professor of international relations at the Getlio Vargas Foundation But this would be a fraught strategy Its very unlikely that the people will take to the streets to put pressure on lawmakers because the reforms particularly pensions are deeply unpopular says Mr SpektorCorruption scandals are another emerging risk especially given the role that the backlash against graft played in electing Mr BolsonaroProsecutors are investigating the finances of a former driver of one of Mr Bolsonaros sons Flvio who was elected to the senate this year after it was revealed that large sums of money had passed through his account that had little relation to his incomeThe presidentelect has pandered to rural lobbies who want to open up the Amazon to agriculture  AFPThe Bolsonaros have denied responsibility Onyx Lorenzoni Mr Bolsonaros chief of staff is also under investigation over receiving illegal campaign paymentsThe other risk is the adherence of Mr Bolsonaro his sons and some of his ministers to sometimes obscure rightwing and Christian ideas Mr Bolsonaro has appointed as foreign minister Ernesto Arajo a midlevel diplomat and Donald Trump fan who once described John Lennons song Imagine as both the anthem of economic hyperglobalisation and the hymn of Marxism in its communist dreamThe new government is reorienting foreign policy towards Israel and the US and away from the Arab Middle East and China which are major trading partners without receiving any apparent concessions in return analysts sayThe strategies are already exposing rifts in the new government between the ideologues and the pragmatistsOur relationship with either the US or with China has to be one of a global player says Mr Bolsonaros vicepresidentelect retired general Hamilton Mouro who is emerging as one of the more cautious voices in the new government There has to be mutual benefits in this relationshipOn other foreign policy issues too the incoming administration is making what analysts call mistake after mistake The presidentelect is scepticalon climate change and the environment His pandering to rural lobbies which want to open up lands belonging to indigenous and traditional communities to agriculture could compromise the international reputation of Brazils soyabean and meat exports analysts say Foreign farmers could use deforestation to pressure their governments to block Brazilian exportsIts almost childish a very simplistic way to move internationally says Michael Freitas Mohallem a professor at law school FGV Direito RioFor now markets are treating these controversies as the teething problems of a new administration Whatever its ideological whims might be say economists it will have no choice but to pursue marketoriented reformsBut with expectations sky high Mr Bolsonaro will need to deliver or his administrations honeymoon with both voters and markets will be shortlived

his financial firepowerGovernmentbacked funds in Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi according to people familiar with the matter have told SoftBank executives they have concerns about SoftBanks negotiations to buy a majority of moneylosing WeWork whose industrialchic workspaces and shortterm leases have made it one of the worlds hottest startupsSoftBanks Vision Fund is already a major investor in WeWork after acquiring nearly a fifth of the company last year with an investment of 44 billion at a valuation of 20 billion SoftBank subsequently committed another 4 billion including a 3 billion commitment last month at a 45 billion valuation The new investment would value WeWork at around 36 billion the people said and would bring SoftBank and its affiliates total investment in the company to more than 24 billionSaudi Arabias Public Investment Fund or PIF and Abu Dhabis Mubadala Investment Co contributed the bulk of the nearly 100 billion raised by the SoftBank Vision Fund Their size gives them an effective veto over certain investments and a loud voice in validating Mr Sons movesThe pushback against the new WeWork deal is unusual for the freewheeling Mr Son who typically gets to invest as he pleases The 61yearold executive has transformed SoftBank from a stodgy Japanese cellphone provider into one of the most influential technology investors in the world bending investors to a vision based more on instinct than traditional financial analysisSome of the people said that PIF and Mubadala have questioned the wisdom of doubling down on WeWork and have cast doubt on its rich valuation The company is on track to lose around 2 billion this year and the funds have expressed concern that WeWorks model could leave it exposed if the economy turns down some of the people saidPIF and Mubadala are both heavily invested in real estate and have told SoftBank executives they would prefer the fund stick to technology bets some of the people saidThe deal under discussion would include 10 billion from SoftBank to buy out most existing outside shareholders plus another 6 billion in new capital for WeWork over the next three years according to people familiar with the matter The deal would leave WeWork Chief Executive Adam Neumann with control of the company one person said The companies are hoping to announce the deal early next year although talks are fluid and it could still fall apartMr Son still hopes the sovereign funds will let the Vision Fund pay for some of the deal one of the people said SoftBank is considering other ways to fund the deal including using its own cash raising debt and bringing in outside investors the person said It may use the proceeds from the initial public offering of its Japanese telecom businessSoftBank already carries heavy debt nearly 18 trillion or roughly 158 billion as of Sept 30Mr Son who has backed other companies including Uber Technologies Inc and Indian ecommerce company Flipkart has occasionally encountered skepticism from his investors and board members but generally they have gone alongThe pushback from Mubadala and Saudi Arabias PIF shows Mr Son is testing his most enthusiastic backers It also raises questions about the broader risk appetite of investors who have thrown money at fastgrowing startups no matter how unprofitable in hopes of future profitsUnder the deal being discussed SoftBank would buy out existing investors at a valuation of around 22 billion subject to a shareholder vote The additional money put into the company would come in 2 billion chunks in each of the next three years at a higher valuation the people saidThe Wall Street Journal first reported the WeWork talks in October Beyond its massive size the prospective deal would be unusual in that it would leave Mr Neumann in control of WeWork despite the fact that SoftBank would own most of the company and provide the new capital Mr Neumann currently controls WeWorks board and his shares give him 10 times as many votes as other investors shares according to company filings As of late last year he controlled a limited liability company that owned 30 of WeWorkWeWork has spent years marketing itself like a tech company and Mr Neumann has compared it to Amazoncom Inc saying that office space is to WeWork what books were to Amazon just the beginningSome analysts say it more closely resembles an oldschool officeleasing company and have warned that if demand for office space and rent prices fall WeWork could be stuck with fixedrent leases for 10 to 15 yearsIf WeWork becomes a huge hit it would bolster Mr Sons record of prescient bets and be a boon to SoftBanks shareholders Mr Son invested 5 million with Chinese entrepreneur Jack Ma for a fledgling ecommerce company Alibaba that went on to become a behemothWeWork has spent heavily on new office space as it has grown While executives years ago predicted strong profits by now losses have recently grown faster than revenue WeWork took in 12 billion in revenue in the first nine months of the year but spent twice as much posting a 12 billion net loss WeWork has said the losses reflect heavy investment in growth and individual offices are profitable once they are leasedThe deal talks come at a turbulent time for SoftBank and Saudi Arabia which committed 45 billion to the Vision Fund The Saudi connection to the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the

employees were to be judged by the level of courage they displayedMs Walmsley may be considered to have passed the test herself this week after announcing that GSK is to form a consumer health joint venture with PfizerThe move which required no upfront cash outlay will pave the way for the consumer division to be spun off breaking up the business whose diversified toothpastetovaccines structure her predecessor Sir Andrew Witty had long defendedHowever questions remain about whether her bold strokes will satisfy investorsThe companys shares closed 38 per cent higher on Wednesday but even this did not make up for the 5bn sum wiped off GSKs market value by her decision two weeks ago to pay 51bn to acquire Tesaro a near200 per cent premium for an oncologyfocused biotech whose lead drug faces strong competitionSome also queried whether the standalone pharma and vaccines business would be vulnerable It is expected to have a market capitalisation significantly larger than the 40bn valuation being put on the new consumer joint venture but still lags behind other big global playersSamuel Johar chairman of board advisory firm Buchanan Harvey argued it was likely to be a takeover target because it is subscale with not a very strong pipelineSpeaking to reporters Ms Walmsley said that the deal was something weve been able to do quickly and quietly People close to the matter said the talks between the companies took less than three months However investors restiveness had provided its own kind of clue that she would take decisive action to reshape the group While it has succeeded in maintaining its dividend at 80p for four consecutive years and confirmed it would maintain this in 2019 GSKs share price has underperformed the wider global pharma and biotech sector in the last decade by almost 60 per cent In July the FT reported that Sir Philip Hampton GSK chairman was weighing a demerger after coming under pressure from top10 shareholders to split up the business People close to the negotiations that unfolded at speed in recent weeks say that a crucial factor in consummating the deal was the two companies existing joint venture ViiV Healthcare which specialises in HIV treatment This contributed to what one insider described as a fluid relationship between the two companies ensuring a natural channel for communication Deborah Waterhouse ViiV chief executive praised the companys contribution in an interview with the FT earlier this year describing Pfizer as very challenging which is fantastic because I think it makes us better and strongerAlthough the deal may only have come to a head in the dying days of the year Ms Walmsley who rose through the ranks of GSKs consumer health division has had her eyes on Pfizers portfolio since 2011When those assets were put on the block by Pfizer more than a year ago a key hurdle was GSKs existing consumer joint venture with Novartis which meant the Swiss drugmaker would have to agree on any move for the Pfizer unit GSK meanwhile was wary of committing upwards of 20bn in cash for the Pfizer unit before it knew whether Novartis planned to exercise its option to sell its 365 per cent stake in the JVOne person close to the negotiations said that GSK was heavily involved in the final stages of the Pfizer auction but ultimately opted not to put in a firm offer The notion of a joint venture was there toward the end of the auction process The minority buyout of Novartis was a big priority on the capital allocation side after pharma The process started to flush out the opportunity That cleared a big hurdle he said The timing of the joint venture may not have been entirely in Ms Walmsleys gift however When it delivered its quarterly results at the end of October Pfizer laid out a number of possible routes for its consumer health unit including a joint venture and indicated that it wanted a decision for the increasingly noncore unit made by the end of the year Emma Walmsley chief executive of GSK has had her eyes on Pfizers portfolio since 2011  ReutersOne person said that GSK would rather have waited until next year by which time it would have made more evident progress on the pharma side but decided it needed to act quicklyFor all the excitement surrounding the move Ms Walmsley herself has stated that her priority remains building up the pharma business That unit has generated notably fewer blockbuster drugs than rivalsShe is betting that the cash generated by the strengthened consumer unit will fund further dealmaking and investment into the companys pharmaceutical business Explaining why she liked the deal she said Its not only about the value creation in consumer its also about the support it gives to our number one priority pharma

cut growth for the region in 2019 according to a Financial Times poll of economistsAll but one of 24 respondents told the FT they expected growth of between 1 per cent and 18 per cent next year The European Central Bank estimates that growth this year 2018 will be 19 per centThe outlook has become increasingly poor and economic conditions could worsen dramatically because of tension between the US and China over trade Such an escalation would prove particularly painful for the regions largest and most exportdependent economy Germany respondents said in the poll which was conducted in midDecemberThe economic fundamentals look encouraging said Florian Hense economist at Berenberg a bank Having said that we cannot rule out two major risks First politics may go badly wrong Think trade Brexit Italy Second even if the big risks that are currently scaring companies and households fade over the course of 2019 the fear factor may take on a life of its own for a whileJrg Krmer chief economist at Commerzbank said he was concerned that a decade of deglobalisation lies ahead of us which would weigh on growth in a region that relies heavily on manufacturing exportsThe estimates follow a dramatic slowdown in the second half of 2018 with the economy expanding by just 02 per cent between the second and third quarters its lowest level in more than four years on the back of a slowdown in export salesThe ECBs latest forecasts show growth hitting 17 per cent next year as lower unemployment and a sharper rise in wages boost domestic spendingMost economists polled by the FT supported the ECBsstance There are still convincing arguments in favour of the upswing to continue albeit at a more moderate pace with private consumption propped up for now by resilient employment growth said Michael Heise chief economist at AllianzEconomists expectations for inflation lay mostly between 12 per cent and 18 per cent compared with an ECB target of just under 2 per cent While some respondents said stronger wage growth would spur underlying price pressures others saw little evidence that the pickup in pay was driving prices higherWhile a surge in oil prices drove headline inflation above 2 per cent during 2018 underlying price pressures remain weak One respondent Guntram Wolff director of Bruegel a Brusselsbased thinktank forecast that core inflation which strips out changes in oil and food price and is seen as a better indicator of longer term pressures would remain weak at just 1 per centMany of the 24 respondents played down the economic threat of a surge in support for populist parties in European elections in the springHowever the gilets jaunes protests in France could alter the course of economic policy in Europe with Emmanuel Macrons concessions to the movement receiving the backing of many economists who believe that some governments should spend moreFor too long eurozone governments have insisted on austerity said Alberto Gallo portfolio manager and head of macro strategies at Algebris Investments France has given an interesting signal towards more spending this should also come from core countries along with reforms to boost productivityFrances president has introduced a string of measures aimed at taming the protest movement including a sharp hike in the minimum wageMacron will have to find a way to tax more and spend more or face more protests and electoral failure said Alastair Winter chief economist at Daniel Stewart Other countries including the UK will have to follow suitThe French measures follow a standoff between the European Commission and Rome in which Brussels pushed back against the Italian governments plans for more spending Both sides have agreed to sign off on more limited spending plansUnwinding or postponing reforms which were central to Macrons ability to push Berlin towards greater eurozone reform will zap his moral authority at the EU level said Mujtaba Rahman managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group Blowing a hole in the fiscal deficit makes it harder for the EU to collectively impose discipline on RomeOthers said that the combination of the events in France and Italy added weight to the argument that the EU needed to review the suitability of the rules in supporting the regions longterm economic interestsMacrons concessions and the Italian fiscal fiasco show that the fundamental controversy in the eurozone on the right policy mix is far from being solved said Carsten Brzeski economist at INGDiBa In the worstcase scenario this could prepare the grounds for the next existential crisis for the eurozoneAfter a bumper 2017 in which eurozone growth hit its highest level for a decade most economists projections for 2018 were overly confidentThe 34 respondents to last years poll forecast growth of on average 23 per cent this year Instead the ECBs latest projection is for an economic expansion of 19 per cent However respondents were right that the ECB would judge the eurozone economy strong enough to wean it off the most important element of its crisis era stimulus its massive quantitative easing programme Several economists guessed correctly that the bank would call time on the expansion of QE in December Forecasts for the first eurozone interest rate increase look overly optimistic however the most common answer for the 2018 poll was that borrowing costs would rise in the first half of 2019 Many in markets now predict the first hike will not be until 2020 Respondents were right that President Emmanuel Macrons economic reforms would spur growth in France However no one predicted the political backlash against Mr Macron which have resulted in the French president making big concessions to protesters in recent weeks

moveBristolMyers said Thursday that it would pay 74 billion in cash and stock for Summit New Jerseybased Celgene grabbing a blockbuster cancer drug and what it described as a promising pipeline of experimental therapies that will help broaden its business But with at least six months before when the companies expect to complete the deal plenty could happenShareholders from Celgene and BristolMyers will have to approve the transaction and there are early signs they have doubts Theres an almost 15 spread between where Celgenes stock is trading and BristolMyerss offer  the thirdwidest spread among more than 100 active deals being tracked by Bloomberg Options trading is also indicating a potential snagGiven where Celgene is trading there has to be some sizable discount that the deal doesnt get done said Brian Skorney an analyst with Robert W Baird amp CoBoth companies said Thursday that they expect the deal to rapidly add to earnings My focus is on creating shareholder value for the long term and I think this deal does that BristolMyers Chief Executive Officer Giovanni Caforio said in an interviewPatent RisksCelgenes biggest drug is Revlimid a cancer blockbuster that in 2017 brought in an estimated 97 billion in sales  almost twothirds of the companys revenue While it has a thicket of more than 20 patents that could protect it until as late as 2028 theyre under assault by genericdrug makers eager for a slice of Revlimids salesCelgene reached a settlement with generic drugmaker Natco Pharma Ltd to allow for a limited number of Revlimid pills starting in March of 2022 But theres a risk that another genericdrug maker Indias Dr Reddys Laboratories Ltd could upend that agreement and flood the market with cheap rivals much soonerDr Reddys has been locked in a legal battle with Celgene over its own generic form of Revlimid arguing that its version doesnt infringe Revlimids patents If a judge agrees Dr Reddys could be in a position to launch a generic drug as soon as late 2020 according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Aude Gerspacher In that case Natco would likely be able to start selling their version sooner too she saidEveryone thought they were going to settle over a year ago and they havent Gerspacher said calling the Dr Reddys litigation the big legal overhang for Celgene right nowBristolMyers said Thursday that it had modeled for a variety of scenarios around Revlimid and was using conservative assumptions about the drugs futurePolitics in WashingtonThe megadeal could also get caught up in the national debate over drug pricesPresident Donald Trump isnt the only one in Washington who has targeted drugmakers While Congress doesnt have power to stop the merger it can call in CEOs for hearings subpoena documents related to the deal or take other steps to paint the companies in a negative light Hours after the merger was announced senior Democrats in Congress were criticizing itMergers that mean more money for drug company CEOs while patients pay the price are not a solution to skyrocketing drug costs Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Twitter The Massachusetts Democrat is exploring a run for the Democratic nomination for presidentDemocrats now the majority in the House of Representatives are expected to pressure pharmaceutical companies over drug costs with a flurry of bills and hearings Celgenes name often comes up in the drug pricing debate given tactics its taken to protect its blockbuster cancer drug Revlimid from generic competition while repeatedly raising its priceRevlimid is a prime example of the unsustainable path that drug prices are on said Maryland Representative Elijah Cummings the likely incoming chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform I plan to take a hard look at the entire process to determine why drug companies continue to raise the prices of critical drugs at the expense of the American peopleClosing SurprisesThe takeover still has to be approved by shareholders and the 14 percent drop in BristolMyerss shares Thursday  the biggest oneday loss since August 2016  is an indication they may not love the idea of making Celgene a part of the New Yorkbased drugmakerBut they might be open to a different option said Alex Arfaei an analyst with BMO Capital Markets  BristolMyers becoming a target for an even bigger buyerWe could see competing offers for BristolMyers before the shareholder vote Arfaei said in a note to clients Other companies that may have previously looked at a merger with BristolMyers now have a window given the stocks weakness and upcoming shareholder voteBristolMyers has faced struggles with its own drugs and its stock was down 15 percent last yearDid Bristol do this deal as a poison pill and to prevent them from getting acquired said Skorney Could someone like Pfizer come in and appeal directly to Bristol shareholders and say your share price is down we will take you out but you have to vote against the Celgene deal He called such a scenario unlikely but not impossibleLaura Hortas a spokeswoman for BristolMyers declined to comment on that speculation The deal has a 22 billion breakup fee according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because it hasnt been disclosed yetAntitrustMergers between brandname drugmakers usually sail through Washingtons antitrust authoritiesWhile the deal will be investigated by antitrust enforcers in the US and EU for any potential harm to competition merger investigations in the pharmaceutical industry follow a familiar playbook and are typically resolved by selling product lines where the two companies compete That was the case for example when Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd agreed to sell 79 products in order to win US approval in 2016 to buy Allergans genericdrug businessYet not everyone in Washington is satisfied that enough is being done Antitrust enforcers at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have faced a barrage of complaints from lawmakers about market power wielded by pharmaceutical firms leading to rising prices for consumersRepresentative Peter Welch the lead sponsor of an effort to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices plans to circulate a letter for lawmakers to sign on asking the US Federal Trade Commission to look really skeptically at this proposed mergerIt has to be with conditions to keep the company from raising prices on drugs Welch a Democrat from Vermont said in an interview My hope is that President Trump will be our ally on this said Welch who

respond with legislation to a federal court ruling that found the Affordable Care Act to be unconstitutional as Democratic attorneys general weighed legal action to challenge the judges decision Republicans on Sunday said they wanted to maintain the 2010 laws guarantee of insurance coverage for people with preexisting conditions But they also said they continued to oppose most or all of the law such as its requirement that most people obtain health insurance the socalled individual mandate How they might accomplish both goals remained unclear There is widespread support for protecting people with preexisting conditions Theres also widespread opposition to the individual mandate said Sen Susan Collins R Maine speaking on CNN She said the insurancepurchasing requirement which is intended to ensure enough healthy people buy policies to make the plans economically viable was particularly burdensome for low and middleincome families Democrats called for a quick vote to intervene in the federal case to show the judge in the case that the intent of Congress has been to preserve the law Sen Chuck Schumer D NY said Sunday on NBC that Democrats will press the GOP leadership to hold a floor vote urging intervention in the case We have a divided House and Senate he said I think the courts have to be the first and best way to go US District Judge Reed OConnor a George W Bush appointee ruled Friday that the ACA is unconstitutional He sided with the claims of 20 Republicanled states that brought a lawsuit seeking to strike down the law The law remains in place for now and the Trump administration has signaled it plans to enforce it But its future is uncertain and the ruling essentially leaves decisions on implementing the law to the states in the near term Congress has been unable to pass substantive health care legislation at a time when Republicans control both houses of Congress and the White House With Democrats taking control of the House next month the prospects for anything beyond modest legislation are likely to become dimmer That could mean the next substantial steps rest on legal action rather than legislation The legal staff working for Attorney General Xavier Becerra of California one of several Democraticled states moving to defend the health law spent the weekend examining their legal options They said they would challenge the decision soon House Democrats are gearing up to push legislation introduced in March by Representatives Frank Pallone Jr D NJ Richard Neal D Mass and Bobby Scott D Va that would block Trump administration initiatives to roll back the ACA Many Republicans said on the campaign trail this fall that they supported some goals of the ACA most prominently ensuring coverage for people with existing conditions Now Republican lawmakers will have to decide whether to support legislation that meets those goals or resume the GOP push to overhaul the health law Well sit down with the Democrats if the Supreme Court upholds President Trump said on Saturday He was apparently referring to expectations that the ACA case will reach the high court Well be sitting down with the Democrats and we will get great health care for our people Thats a repeal and replace handled a little bit differently Sen Chuck Grassley R Iowa who will lead the Senate Finance Committee in the new Congress said the committee would hold hearings on the health law A group of Senate Republicans introduced legislation in August that would ban insurers on the individual market from denying coverage to people with past or current medical conditions or from charging them more Insurers still would be able to exclude any coverage related to that condition however and could vary premiums based on age and genderall of which are barred by the ACA The Supreme Court has upheld the ACAs mandate that most people carry health insurance or pay a penalty and also ruled that the government can subsidize healthinsurance purchases for lowerincome Americans The pair of decisions preserved key pillars of the ACA Last year a Republican Congress eliminated the monetary penalty for individuals who choose to forgo health insurance That change opened the door for a group of Republicanled states to mount a new challenge to the law Judge OConnor said the new absence of a penalty undercut the Supreme Courts reasoning for upholding the ACA The high court in 2012 said the penalty for going without health insurance could be construed as a tax that Congress had the constitutional authority to levy With the tax now at 0 for 2019 the ACA cant be upheld under Congresss taxing power Judge OConnor ruled He noted that the Supreme Court in its 2012 ruling already said Congress cant use its powers over interstate commerce to require people to buy insurance Brent Kendall contributed to this article Write to Stephanie Armour at stephaniearmourwsjcom and Kristina Peterson at kristinapetersonwsjcom

himself to the nearest rubbish bin was to glimpse a modesty and diligence not obvious in American government these days Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editors Picks His reputation for being a good guy has helped make Uncle Joe a hugely popular figure on the left Recent polls make him the favourite for the next Democratic presidential ticket The latest for CNN gives him 30 of the Democratic vote with his closest rival Senator Bernie Sanders trailing on 14 Mr Biden who had been speaking in Burlington on a book he published last year Promise Me Dad says he will decide whether to embark on his third run for president over Christmas Having visited 31 states this year he is clearly tempted to It would be a mistake if he did That is not to underestimate his strengths which go beyond amiability As he demonstrated in Burlington Mr Biden is a polished turn with moderate instincts and an impressive history of courage in adversity Newly elected to the Senate by Delaware aged 29 he suffered the death of his wife and baby daughter in a car crash leaving him with two young sons to care for The eldest Beau a former attorneygeneral of Delaware with his fathers features and easy charm died of brain cancer in 2015 aged 46 That deterred Mr Biden in the depths of his grief from running in 2016as he explains movingly in his book which is partmemoir for a beloved son partcampaign tome He was also dissuaded by Barack Obama who believed his deputy could not beat Hillary Clinton in the primary He might have been wrong especially if Mr Biden had entered the race before Mr Sanders began kicking up a storm And he could certainly have beaten Donald Trump Trading on his workingclass roots and strong ties to labour unions Mr Biden performs best in the postindustrial states such as his native Pennsylvania that swung the election for Mr Trump He would also have presented a less easy target for the hardright media than Mrs Clinton was But that was then and now Mr Biden seems too old His supporters say his faculties are as sharp as ever But his audiences would be as likely to remember him as the Democrat vying to be the oldest man ever elected president Hes much older than I thought hed be murmured the woman seated behind your columnist in Burlington as the final applause faded away Mr Trump and Mr Sanders the standout performers of 2016 were also old Yet the fact that they were politically unknown to most people mitigated the effect of that Mr Sanderss largely unproductive Senate career also meant he had few political skeletons to hurt him in the primary unlike Mr Biden who voted for many things during his decades in Congress that he would be forced to account for The lesson of the past two presidential elections is that voters want the most novel candidate available to them This suggests that Mr Bidens current strength his superior name recognition would be a weakness Even in the flush of youth in all truth he was a lousy presidential candidate His first run in 1988 the year before the Democrats youngest incoming House member Alexandria OcasioCortez was born started weakly and fizzled quickly after he was caught plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock a British politician His second in 2008 went the same way after several gaffes including his description of Mr Obama his then rival as unusually bright and clean for a black candidate There is a postTrump view that Mr Bidens footinmouth propensity would come over as authentic and engaging Yet his infelicities too often revive racial and gender stereotypes that no Democrat could get away with let alone an old white male one Mr Bidens tactility could be a similar problem After a welcoming hug from the vicepresident the elderly mother of one of his then colleagues told him No man has touched me like that apart from your father Though he has never been accused of anything untoward Mr Bidens notion of personal space does not accord with contemporary standards His top billing today probably says less about him than the Democrats backwardlooking frame of mind Mr Biden represents a lifeline to the golden days of the Obama administration the biggest cheers in Burlington came when he mentioned Mr Obama It is even possible to read his book of reallife grief and recovery as a political allegory for the erasing of the Trump blot that Democrats dream of The fact that Mr Bidens strengths his conviviality and appeal to bluecollar voters map Mrs Clintons big weaknesses reinforces the sense that his prominence is about the past not the future And elections are the other way round There is more than Mr Bidens dignity at stake in this The tremendous moral courage he has shown in circumstances that every parent dreads should resonate far beyond politics It would be a shame to see it reduced to a footnote in a fiercely contested primary battle that he seems unlikely to win That would also be a waste of Mr Bidens potential to act as a Democratic elder statesman unifying the partys diverse candidates and parts Meanwhile his prominence in the primary speculation is a barrier to progress That is most obviously because the left has fresher potentially better workingclass champions who would be likelier to run if Mr Biden does not Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio is one More broadly it is unwise to think that Mr Bidens longago workingclass roots are a substitute for the serious reappraisal of economic policy that the Trump insurgency makes urgent Democrats need new blood They also need new ideas The admirable Mr Biden offers neither This article appeared in the United States section of the print edition under the headline Biden his time

been just a few months since business software giant Salesforce promoted Keith Block to coCEO alongside longtime chief Marc BenioffSalesforce pitched the move as crucial for growthsomething the company is well acquainted with since Block joined Salesforce five years ago after a long stint at database giant Oracle Shares of Salesforce known for delivering sales software via the cloud are now at around 130 more than double their price in 2013Five years ago Salesforces customers were mostly USbased smalltomedium sized businesses Block said Now customers include some of the worlds biggest companies like Toyota American Express and State FarmIn this interview Block talks about Marc Benioff San Franciscos homeless problems and the importance of trust The interview has been edited for length and clarityFortune Why does Salesforce need two CEOsBlock What this is all about is to help scale the company We talk a lot about our goals of getting to 23 billion in sales by fiscal year 2022 the company logged 84 billion in revenue for 2017 and we think about 30 billion and beyond We looked to formalize a model that allows us to make decisions faster divide and conquer and focus on our strengthsWhy couldnt you do that beforeWell weve been doing it for a long period Its really about strengthening the roles and responsibilities and formalizing an operating model I think thats important because if theres any ambiguity then youre going to have inefficiencyWhats an example of a decision you would make that Marc now wouldntAnything from something strategic around how our finance organization is running to our back office infrastructure or our sales gotomarket corporate sales strategy or something with Mulesoft the enterprise software company Salesforce acquired earlier this year for 65 billionSomething that wed do together would be deciding on a new market that we think we should enter or an acquisition that we may go afterthat sort of thingWeve had a pretty rapid rise Five years ago we were a 3 billion company this year well do over 13 billion next year well do over 16 billion in two years well be at 23 billion You cant run the business the same way You want to take the best of what youve had before and you want to add new processes that will help you scale the companyWhat Marc likes to focus on is thinking about company strategy product strategy and culture Really daytoday operations is where my strength is and a lot of focus on customersWhats a common theme youre seeing across the industries you work with Everything is about the customer In the beginning of this century there was this huge push on taking costs out and that will always be there Companies will always try to become more efficient But theres a new thing going on herea new global phenomena on digital transformation which is about growth CEOs need to grow You cant cut your way to prosperityHave any of the recent public concerns around data privacy impacted how businesses come to youCompanies are not coming to us about data privacy Our core values start with trust Every company needs to have a data strategy everybody has to be worried about trust everybody has to be worried about securityWhat companies do you trustI have enormous trust with State Farm I think they have a worldclass CEO in Michael Tipsord I think hes a great example of a strong executive who cares about his people and whose built a culture of trust Dion Weisler of HP Inc I think hes a worldclass executive I think hes done a fantastic job with that company I think Jes Staley at Barclays has done a fantastic job turning around BarclaysDoes Salesforce have to expand from its core customer relationship management CRM products to get biggerNo 1 were in a market that essentially we created Its the fastest growing enterprise category there is Theres the operating system theres database theres ERP and then theres CRM CRM is the fastest growing category and it will be the largest category Were growing at over twice the rate of the marketI think its important to stick to our focusthat we dont try to be like these other legacy companies Theyve got huge portfolios that are not necessarily adjacent You have to look at them and say Why are you doing this why are you doing thatData Sheet Fortunes technology newsletterWhy did you buy Quip a word processing tool to create a Microsoft Office competitorIts not productivity onto itself its productivity as a natural adjacent for a salesperson who wants to be productive or for a service person who wants to be productive Everything we do in acquisitions is a natural adjacency People classically think of Quip as a word processing tool something like Microsoft Office But its a great collaboration tool and every one of our employees uses itMarc Benioff is involved with politics and is vocal about societal issues Is that something you want to doWere actually both very passionate about it in different ways We have our own styles Were both passionate about the culture of the company If you look at whats important to our employees if you look at the position we took in Indiana Salesforce opposed a controversial law that would have let companies deny services to samesex couplesit was a very strong position involving legislation that made our employees feel uncomfortable and threatenedWhen it came to equality and equal pay Salesforce previously said it adjusted its employee compensation to eliminate any pay gap between genders we had to do the right thing for our employeesThe whole situation we recently had with Proposition C Benioff publicly supported the San Francisco measure that would tax certain businesses to fund homeless programs I remember sitting down with Marc My wife and I live in the cityand this is a beautiful city and theres obviously a problem that has to be addressed with the homeless Its a problem with the city the community and for our customersHow does San Franciscos homeless problem impact your customersOur customers want to feel that theyre coming to a place where theyre safe and welcome and where people are being taken care of I said to Marc Ive never seen anything like this Ive worked in New York Ive worked all over the world Ive lived in Boston and this is something that we need to do and the company lined up behind itShould more companies take these kinds of standsMost companies have some kind of philanthropic effort Every company has its own culture and I think you have to respect the culture of other companiesI think we have a trust crisis with our governments and perhaps organizations in our communities I think its created a bit of a void that needs to be filledI think executives and CEOs can fill that void by speaking out I think there needs to be more of a public sectorprivate sector partnership I dont think it can be just the government and I dont think it can be just CEOsI do think more and more CEOs have to speak out because they represent tens of thousands of people It really is about their culture and their values I dont think people can be silent

comparison to traditional news coverage and advertisingTwitter estimates it accounted for just 05 of impressions on electionrelated tweets in 2016Its unlikely this changed any votes given our tendency to use the internet to confirm existing biases One study found thatalmost60 of visits to fake news sites were by the 10 of people with the most conservative news consumptionPolitics has always had deception and misinformation It always will says Brendan Nyhan a publicpolicy professor at the University of Michigan and one of the studys coauthors Having government sanctioned overseers decide what content gets taken down smacks of censorship Even selfappointed overseers like Mark Zuckerbergs proposed internal Supreme Court to adjudicate hate speech on Facebook will succumb to political biases despite the best of intentionsThe case for regulating privacy is somewhat strongerTheres an obvious conflict between customer privacy and the business models of companies like Google Facebook Twitter and increasinglyAmazoncomInc which gather as much information about their users as possible and then monetize itYet as with the political free speech the solution toprivacy concernsshould fit the problem In a recent columnAlec Stapp of the NiskanenCenter a libertarian think tank notes similarworriesaccompanied Caller ID and loyalty cards Around twothirds of Americans dont care that much about

according to Ghosterywhich develops privacyenhancing web technologyGhostery speculates that Google and Facebook had more resources to devote to compliance and that website owners dropped smaller

of Capitalism Monopolies and the Death of Competition Either the upstarts sell out to the bigger company or they get ruthlessly crushedAntitrust has risks of its own denying companies synergies they might achieve if free to acquire or exclude competitors Nor are trust busters free of their own political agendas Yet these risks seem much less consequential than those that come from regulating

romantic Christmas celebration with her husband Ken She made eggs Benedict bacon and Bloody Mary cocktails for brunch Then the couple lounged around in their pajamas and exchanged giftsMs Aiken gave her husband a foulweather jacket for sailing some history books cashmere socks and a pair of cuff links She didnt see any packages for herself under the tree but got excited when he handed her a Christmas card and said her gift was in it I remember thinking The possibilities are endless says Ms Aiken who is 58 and owns a pickleball paddle manufacturing company in Eastport Md It could be a cool trip A gift certificate to a spa Or tickets to a Broadway showIt wasnt Inside the envelope was a photocopy of the description of a class Mr Aiken had purchased for his wife Marine Diesel Basics a course in engine maintenanceSometimes it doesnt matter if we were naughty or nice We still wont get what we want under the treeAnd even though were adultswe know to be grateful for the thought and effort someone puts into giving us a gifta bad one can still burn We expect our friends and loved ones to understand us best A bad gift can feel like a lack of recognition and connection You feel misunderstood says Daniella Kupor an assistant professor of marketing at Boston University Questrom School of Business who studies gift giving Bad gifts are hard on the giver too We may feel like a failure Most people give with the intention of helping another person says Lara Aknin associate professor of social psychology at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver British Columbia It hurts when we miss that goalOne reason for gift fails Givers typically focus on the moment the gift is exchangedhoping for maximum reactionwhile recipients typically are more interested in how valuable the gift will be to them later according to a paper published two years ago in Current Directions in Psychological Science The types of gifts that people like to give are really exciting when they are opened says Julian Givi a doctoral candidate in marketing at Carnegie Mellon Universitys Tepper School of Business and a coauthor of the study But recipients focus on what gift will be best for them when they go to use it down the roadIn other words givers want to give fun gifts Receivers want something both enjoyable and useful So those custom socks with a picture of you and your dog on them might get a big laugh from your brother when he opens them But what he really wants are a pair of decent wool ones to take hikingThe researchers found other discrepancies between the preferences of givers and receivers Givers often prefer unrequested gifts but recipients prefer ones they asked for People like giving material objectsjewelry candy a mugyet recipients often want experiences such as a gift certificate to a spa or tickets to a show And while givers like to give specific gifts recipients say they often prefer more general presents such a gift card to a store that sells diverse merchandiseGivers also think its important to spend a lot of money yet recipients dont care how much the gift cost the researchers found And while givers prefer to give complete gifts recipients would rather have a partial gift of something they really want rather than a whole gift of something they dont A gift certificate that only covers part of a pricey treatment at the fancy spa your sister loves is still better than an entire meal at a restaurant she doesnt likeMs Aiken who has been married 23 years struggled to look gracious when she discovered her Christmas gift was a course in maintaining diesel engines But in Gods name how did he think I would like this she thoughtShe was disappointed she says because she felt the gift showed her husband didnt understand her I would be fine with a small gift she says But I wanted something that spoke to me that showed he took the time and found something I would think is great Her husbands giftgiving track record was mixed but hed never missed the mark so badly beforeWhat was Mr Aiken thinking The couple was planning to buy a sailboat and sail it to the Bahamas and he thought it was important that they knew how to fix the engine He thought that the course would make his wife who loves to sail more confident in the ocean and that it would be a fun shared activityhe enrolled himself tooBut he saw right away that his gift was a bomb by his wifes sigh and the way her shoulders drooped Still the couple took the courseboth learned a lotand the gift has become a funny story to tell friends But now Mr Aiken says he does try harder to find something his wife will enjoy Hes since given her a gold bracelet diamond earrings and an oceansailing course Now I ask her what she wants says Mr Aiken 66 a boat captainThis year Ms Aiken wants a Turkish cotton bathrobe Shes excited because she can already see an appropriatesized box with a bow under the treeStill Shopping Heres What to GiveGifts that reflect the giver While both givers and receivers prefer gifts that reflect the recipient both people feel closer when the gift reflects the giver according to six studies published together in 2015 in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology It can be challenging to know what the right gift is to reflect the recipients interests and passions and as a result we may miss the mark says Lara Aknin associate professor of social psychology at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver British Columbia and lead author on a study So we might be better off sharing our own interests with the other personessentially giving them a piece of ourselves You might give your favorite book of nature poems to an outdoorsy friend or a gift certificate to your favorite restaurant to someone who loves foodGifts you already own and like Recipients liked gifts better when the giver owned them too according to six studies published together last year in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin There is something intimate about sharingthink of sharing a meal or a bed or watching a movie together says Evan Polman assistant professor of marketing at Wisconsin School of Business at the University of WisconsinMadison and lead author on the study The same thing happens when people share a material item It brings the giver and receiver together and gives them something to talk aboutGifts that reflect practicality not just perceived status When givers focused on the convenience and practicality of their gift the recipients felt closer to them according to five studies published together this past July in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin If you can give something that is both highly desirable and convenient thats perfect says SoYon Rim associate professor of psychology at William Paterson University in New Jersey and lead author on the study But if you have a choice between giving a gift certificate to a superb restaurant that is an hour from the recipients home and a more moderately rated but still good one that is 15 minutes away pick the closer one And if you can communicate that you focused on logistics that will make the person feel closer to you Dr Rim saysPartial gifts to something the recipient truly wants Sometimes we know what the recipient wants but cant afford it In this case its best to give a portion of the bigger gift says Daniella Kupor assistant professor of marketing at Boston University Questrom School of Business and lead author on four studies published together last year in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin that showed recipients prefer a portion of the gift they want the most So think a gift certificate to Ticketmaster even if you cant cover the full cost of the tickets your friend wants Or the wedding classic One place setting of china rather than candlesticks that cost the same amount A sentimental gift Givers shy away from sentimental giftsthe scrapbook of photos engraved bracelet or mug with a meaningful sayingbecause they arent sure they will be wellreceived So they go for something that is more of a sure bet such as a jersey for a favorite athlete or a scarf they know the recipient will like even when they know its not the greatest gift But recipients like sentimental gifts a lot more often than givers suspect they do according to a paper published last year in the Journal of Consumer Psychology A sentimental gift is meaningful and tailored to the recipient and they really appreciate that says Julian Givi a doctoral candidate in marketing at Carnegie Mellons Tepper School of Business Have you ever gotten or given an awful

the US government is hoping for its day in court The Chinese cellulartechnology giant is relying on a team of recently hired American lawyers who have filed legal ripostes to US agencies to defend itself from an onslaught of accusations and restrictions emanating from Washington according to people familiar with the matter Huawei reshaped its strategy for dealing with the US government this spring as Washington intensified its campaign to blacklist the worlds biggest manufacturer of cellulartower equipment and No 2 smartphone maker behind Samsung Electronics Co In recent weeks that campaign included a classified briefing held by Sens Richard Burr and Mark Warner who lead the Senate Intelligence Committee for representatives from the four major US wireless carriers to share concerns about Huawei according to people familiar with the meeting In response to the building offensive against it the company in April cut back on an already meager effort to communicate with Congress and federal agencies It laid off four people who worked in the US on government and public relations said people familiar with the matter It hired two law firms Jones Day and Morgan Lewis and Bockius LLP to focus instead on potential legal challenges to US courts the only government branch Huawei considers impartial one of the people said In August the law firms filed lengthy comments to the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Communications Commission contesting pending measures that would restrict Huawei sales in the US Earlier this year Huawei leaders in China concluded that engaging with those federal agencies and Congress directly was useless said a person familiar with the matter They instead hired the attorneys to help fight an FCC proposal which would bar small wireless and internet providers from using federal subsidies intended to improve internet connections in rural America from buying Huawei equipment In the August filings to the FTC and FCC the lawyers said Huaweis exclusion from the US market would be anticompetitive They said acceptance of Huaweis cuttingedge telecom equipment and smartphones would benefit people and businesses by increasing competition which would lower prices and promote innovation In a fresh filing on Dec 7 Huaweis lawyers challenged whether a recently signed defensespending bill gave the FCC the authority to move forward with the antiHuawei measure They said the government should consider a more comprehensive cybersecurity approach that goes beyond simply banning an telecomequipment company from the US market The focus on legal challengesnot government or public outreachremains intact these people said after Canada earlier this month arrested Meng Wanzhou the companys finance chief and founders daughter on behalf of the US government over allegations she played a role in violating US sanctions on Iran She denies the charges A Huawei spokesman said the company had every confidence that the Canadian and US legal systems will reach a just conclusion American officials have based their antiHuawei campaignwhich has escalated into a global effort involving allied countries on the notion that Beijing could order Huawei to tap the hardware it makes to spy on or disrupt communications networks Huawei says it is an employeeowned company that isnt beholden to Beijing It says its equipment isnt any more vulnerable to Chinese interference than Western firms who also have Chinese manufacturing operations Huaweis bet on legal due process comes after years of more conventional government and publicrelations outreach which mostly fell short Bill Plummer who ran government and public relations as deputy head of Huaweis Washington office from 2010 until his April 2018 layoff said Huawei leaders in Shenzhen continually ignored advice to be more transparent Mr Plummer was a fierce defender of Huawei in Washington during his tenure A former executive at Huawei rival Nokia Corp and a former US foreign service officer Mr Plummer says now that Huaweis Chinese leaders didnt grasp a big cultural difference over transparency The detention of two Canadian citizens in China and unexpected comments from President Trump have magnified the political stakes of the case involving Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou who was released on bail earlier this week Photo The Canadian Press via AP In the West transparency is laying it all out there he said Huaweis Chinese leadership cant fully understand or accept that concept A Huawei spokesman declined to comment A crucial early misjudgment came in February 2011 when US officials citing nationalsecurity concerns quashed Huaweis bid to buy assets from a Silicon Valley company Huawei deputy chairman Ken Hu responded with an open letter that sought to clarify what the company said was misconceptions about Huawei It concluded  We sincerely hope that the United States government will carry out a formal investigation on any concerns it may have about Huawei The House intelligence committee did just that and met Huawei executives throughout 2012 That October the committee published a report that said Huawei wasnt free of Chinesegovernment influence and thus posed a security risk a judgment that effectively barred Huawei from major US business Huawei provided evasive nonresponsive or incomplete answers to questions at the heart of the security issues posed the report concluded The report came a day after an estimated 16 million people watched a 60 Minutes episode that examined Huawei and its Chinesegovernment ties

their final policy meetings for the year this week and at a time when equity and credit markets signal a forebodingoutlook for the global economy Its important to acknowledge that market stress also reflects a pronounced yearend rush to exitpositions and a wider recognition among investors that the good times courtesy of central bankseasy money are well past usThis is perhaps the most worrying aspect of markets at this juncturethe current risk tantrum is becoming ugly with the potential to hurt confidence in the broad economy In turn that raises the importance of central bank action and in that respect among the Federal Reserve Bank of Japan and the Bank of England only one really matters this weekthe mood music from WashingtonAnother tightening is expected the ninth quarterpoint shift higher for the cycle but the focus for the market is the scope of changes in the Feds forecasts for the economy and the path of interest rates for the current cycle As my colleague Sam Fleming notes in his excellent writeup of what to expect from the Fed on Wednesday growth remains solid the unemployment rate is at levels not seen since 1969 and wage growth is picking upStill inflation expectations are dropping driven mainly by the slump in oil prices and the recent tightening of dollar liquidity as the Feds shrinking balance sheet has weighed on emerging markets equities and now creditAt the September meeting Fed officials sawvia their dot plot another three rate rises in 2019 pushing the upper band to 325 per cent The bond market thinks 2019 is the year for one and done at best by the Fed as the January 2020 Fed funds futures contract implies a rate around 260 per centIan Lyngen at BMO Capital Markets says the meeting statement economic and rate projections followed by the latest tidings from Mr Powellwill set the tone for the opening months of 2019 The shifting focus to the downside risks facing the global economy is undoubtedly a space to watch in the remarks from the Fed chairmanIt is unlikely that the Fed drastically changes the dot plot for 2019 raising the prospect of a negative market reactionHeres Wrightson Icaps Lou Crandall The Feds dot plot will probably be somewhat less hawkish than it was in September but it will continue to assume at least some additional rate increases in 2019 and 2020The general thinking is that the Federal Open Market Committee will indicate that two25 basis point tightenings beckon for 2019 with perhaps an added kicker of lowering itslongterm dot from 3 per cent Keeping two dots in place for 2019 with a longterm target of 2875 per cent or even 275 per cent would indicate policy is close to neutralBut a key factor in the Feds tightening of policy has been the shrinking of its balance sheet now running at a maximum pace of 50bn a month This will continueand comes as some are calling for the Fed to halt the squeeze on global dollar funding which occurs as it shrinks thebalance sheetThe worry is that the reduction of the balance sheet will continue to hamper the performance of markets and wont merit a response from the Fed until sentiment has really soured The status of the balance sheet may well be the most important takeaway for markets from this Fed meetingNeels Heyneke and Mehul Daye at Nedbank say equity markets are being starved of liquidity and note a strong relationship between the change in Global Liquidity M1 and the performance of the global stock marketThey add Global Liquidity leads the global stock market by an average of eight months If there is no boost to Global Liquidity we expect this relationship to hold As a result the risk of further downside potential for stock markets across the world would remain intactHere are a couple of charts that hopefully are not too small for readers on mobile devicesWhen it comes towatching markets itsnot just equities that matterOne key indicator that worries plenty of investors is a flattening yield curve and there is scope for guidance from Mr Powell when he speaks tomorrow While the difference between twoand 10year yields remains positive at about016percentage points we are approaching inversion territorya relationship that has been a reliable indicator of recession in past cyclesAs Wrightson Icap note The economic data collectively still justify another rate hike this month and still suggest that additional rate hikes will be appropriate next year but the change in yield curve dynamics is one more reason for the Fed to be more circumspect in offering hawkish policy guidance about the first half of 2019Any comments on credit and the recent widening in risk premiums would be an important signal that a pause may well arrive early in 2019Fred Cleary of Pegasus Capital sent me an interesting note on Tuesday highlighting how investment gradespreads were around similar levels when the Fed paused in 2000 and 2006Sure the absolute level of yields islower but Fred says sustainable growth rates have close to halved over the same period from 34 down to 152As the US economy slows from here we are about to see how companies with falling cash flows willcover their debts Market Forces hasbeen warning about credit for some time and this is the big story over the next 12 monthsOne area under growing pressure is leveraged loans anindex of which has fallen 26 per cent from itspeak inlate October in part reflecting the prospect of a Fed pause next year that halts the rise we have seen in floating interest rates The loan market is still up some 16 per cent for 2018 thanks to Fed tightening pushing up floating ratesAs Citi notes In our view the weakness is a combination of overall risk aversion widening credit spreads and the waning attractiveness of floatingrate paper The rates market is pricing in less than one 2019 rate hike down from 2 in early OctoberThe concern now is that the liquidation we have seen from investors exposed to the loan sector has only just begun The credit exit can quickly becomevery crowdedAt Longview Economics they think A trigger for a less aggressive Fed in 2019 is the sign of further weakness in the leverage loan market an area that has accounted for a large chunk of credit for companies since 2009So we have a crucial and perhaps definingday looming on Wednesday and as you read thisIll be up in the air on my way to JFK Im certainly looking forward to being in New York for the FOMC meeting and the fallout Then I can catchup with family and friendsQuick Hitswhats on the market radarAll quiet on the China stimulus showNot much for investors hoping for some concrete stimulus measures as Xi Jinping markedthe 40th anniversary of Deng Xiaopings reform and opening up policy For all the hope of a Fed pause global growth prospects need China stimulus in the new year as the US tax reform tailwindfadesThe big allocation switch As I recently noted the pronounced drop in longdated Treasury yields smacked of a major asset allocation switch out of credit and equities Thats the message we heard on Tuesday from the latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of asset managersGlobal investors net underweight position in bonds tumbled 23 percentage

dropping more than 13 per cent to hover around 14000 in late December So what will 2019 have in store The Financial Post asked six banks and investment firms for their 2019 TSX targets and ranked them from high to lowLaurentian Bank of Canada 18500 pointsBoth the US and Canadian markets should be attractive to investors Laurentian Bank of Canada chief economist Sebastien Lavoie said because after all the barriers that have slowed down the SampPTSX index are lifted in 2019 he expects a rally Lavoie expects that by midyear the US and China will have ended their trade spat at least when it comes to merchandised goods the USMCA trade deal will be ratified and the energy industry will have recovered Production cuts from OPEC as well as the provincial curtailment in Alberta and an expected increase in rail capacity should lead to the industrys revival in 2019 he said Lavoie however warns that theres no chance of the TSX hitting his target without those catalystsBMO Capital Markets 18000

earnings and expanding dividends BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski wrote Investors still have a negative sentiment toward investing in Canada but Belski is being contrarian because the markets fundamentals remain strong Should the SampPTSX index reach 18000 points as hes projected it would be an alltime high And even then Belski admits the projection may be too low

resurgence of global markets in 2019 and that should help boost the SampPTSX index as well Improvements in global markets Marion said usually result in the depreciation of the US dollar which should then lead to a rally in commodities prices However Marion admits that this is unlikely to happen without a resolution to the USChina trade war which has been baked into his target of 16600 points

is walking the fine line of defensiveness for 2019 that involves upgrading two sectors that traditionally outperform in defensive markets  communications and consumer staples Regardless of the more cautious approach de Verteuil sees the SampPTSX index gaining more than 1300 points The projected boost is attributed to a healthier energy market set to recover after individual companies were taken

youd never know it The greystoned Parisian mansion on the Place des EtatsUnis now belongs to a luxury crystal company The staff I spoke to had no idea that US president Woodrow Wilson borrowed the house in spring 1919 There is no plaque Yet the salon is where Wilson and the British and French prime ministers David Lloyd George and Georges Clemenceau sprawled in armchairs or crawled on the carpet over a giant map of Europe as they drafted the Treaty of Versailles The young British diplomat Harold Nicolson who tried to advise them one afternoon complained It is appalling that these ignorant and irresponsible men should be cutting Asia Minor to bits as if they were dividing a cakeThe negotiations in Paris only the signing was in Versailles were a case study in primitive multilateralism From January to June 1919 these three men redrew the worlds maps mostly by themselves They largely ignored their own advisers and almost entirely ignored the rest of the world Primitive multilateralism diminished after 1945 but its making a comeback todayThe victorious nations of the first world war were unprepared for peace writes Margaret MacMillan in her authoritative history Peacemakers But the Russian Ottoman and AustroHungarian empires had dissolved and Germany had been defeated so suddenly there were borders to redraw This was done with little input from the people concerned Germany and newly Bolshevik Russia werent represented in Paris China was barely heard and the worlds colonies even less so a young kitchen assistant at the Paris Ritz Ho Chi Minh never got a reply to his petition for Vietnamese independence The Italians and Japanese were initially at the negotiating table but struggled to follow conversations in English and were soon sidelined The Italians walked out over their obsessive demands for tiny Fiume now Croatian RijekaPublic opinion back home influenced the Big Three only over Germany citizens and press demanded that the Hun be punished But voters scarcely cared about lesserknown nationsThe three leaders lacked focus time and knowledge Clemenceau was 77 diabetic and had been damaged by an assassins bullet in February despite tuttutting afterwards We have just won the most terrible war in history yet here is a Frenchman who misses his target six times out of seven at pointblank range Wilson was in a hurry uneasy about spending nearly six months in Paris a record foreign stint for a US president Lloyd George struggled with geography he hadnt known that New Zealand was east of AustraliaSometimes the three of them fought especially over the Middle East You are the very baddest boy Clemenceau told Lloyd George Eventually France got Syria and Britain an Iraq concocted out of hostile ethnic groups even though this contradicted Wilsons principle of selfdetermination The trio initially forgot Kurdistan altogetherSometimes delegations of lesser countries were allowed into the mansion to present their cases This rarely went well John Maynard Keynes representing the British treasury witnessed Belgiums presentation Clemenceau slept Wilson glanced at his newspaper and Lloyd George entranced by one Belgian delegates falsetto amused himself comparing it to a number of other voices human and animal that he rememberedSlapdash as the Paris peace conference was it shouldnt be blamed for causing the second world war argues MacMillan The conventional story is that a cruel treaty outraged the Germans and prompted Hitlers revenge True the French started off demanding 44bn in reparations from Germany but they later climbed down MacMillan estimates that by 1932 Germany had paid 11bn 72bn in todays moneyThe bigger problem with the peace was its optics The initial plan to negotiate with Germany was forgotten as the Big Three spent months negotiating with each other Finally the Germans were simply told to sign the treaty which included a dubious provocative clause asserting German war guilt Versailles was indeed a diktat to Germany says historian Eckart ConzeIf only the peacemakers hadnt been in such a rush They didnt even reread the treaty before giving it to Germany Almost instantly Lloyd George and many other Britons and Americans regretted their harshness Much too stiff agonised Nicolson But they failed to soften the document partly because there were no permanent multilateral institutions where such things could be hashed out endlessly in full boring detail The League of Nations Wilsons brainchild was created in 1920 but never achieved much Only after 1945 did strong multilateral bodies ariseToday they are losing influence The worlds three most powerful men all have remarkable independence of action Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping each wield more personal power than any other Russian or Chinese leader in decades Donald Trump a bad listener sounds like Keyness description of Wilson He allowed himself to be closeted unsupported unadvised and alone with men much sharper than himself in situations of supreme difficulty Unchecked ageing leaders in a room together is a primitive system that weve tried beforeIf you are a subscriber and would like to receive

conglomerate has been collecting an unusual amount of data from smartphones around the world and attempting to subscribe some users to paid services without permission according to a Londonbased security firms researchThe free app one of the worlds mostdownloaded weather apps in Googles Play store is from TCL Communication Technology Holdings Ltd of Shenzhen China TCL makes Alcatel andBlackBerrybranded phones while a sister company makes televisionsThe app called Weather ForecastWorld Weather Accurate Radar collects data including smartphone users geographic locations email addresses and unique 15digit International Mobile Equipment Identity IMEI numbers on TCL servers in China according to Upstream Systems the mobile commerce and security firm that found the activity Until last month the app was known as WeatherSimple weather forecastA TCL spokesman didnt address queries about the amount of data the app collectsThe weather app also has attempted to surreptitiously subscribe more than 100000 users of its lowcost Alcatel smartphones in countries such as Brazil Malaysia and Nigeria to paid virtualreality services according to Upstream Systems The security firm which discovered the activity as part of its work for mobile operators said users would have been billed more than 15 million had it not blocked the attemptsAfter The Wall Street Journal made inquiries about the apps activities in November TCL updated the app in Googles Play store The app then stopped trying to subscribe users to services according to Upstream though the data collection continuesThe TCL spokesman said the company has various security safeguards in place but is now evaluating new security consultants who can provide additional validation of the safety of our mobile applications we develop He didnt comment on the attempted subscriptions Many popular smartphone apps collect a variety of data and weather apps typically need a users location to provide weather information But TCLs app asks for data beyond the norm such as the IMEI number and email addresses according to Michael Covington an executive at Wandera a San Francisco mobile security firm that reviewed the apps functionality at The Wall Street Journals request I wouldnt install that app said Mr Covington Wanderas vice president of product strategy Its really questionable when an app that has such a benign functionality is taking information that is uniquely identifiable All the activity happens in the background said Dimitris Maniatis a security executive at Upstream There is no opportunity for the user to see a warningWidening smartphone use and the ability of mobile advertising to target users around the world create the ideal setup for malicious activity said Upstream Chief Executive Guy Krief Hundreds of millions of people especially in emerging markets are accessing the internet for the first time on lowcost devicesSince TCL released the app in December 2016 it has been downloaded more than 10 million times It has ranked among the top five weather apps in some 30 countries according to mobileapp analytics firm App Annie In 2018 it was the sixth most popular weather app in the UK and in Canada and in 2017 it was among the 20 most popular in the US according to App Annie It is especially popular in countries such as Brazil Mexico and the PhilippinesThe weather app is designed for smartphones running Googles Android operating system There is no version for Apples iOS A Google spokesman said the company doesnt comment on individual apps Googles app store suspended two apps from Chinese companies in December following allegations they could have been used in an ad fraud schemeThe TCL apps attempted subscriptions came from a preinstalled version of the app on Alcatel smartphones that cannot be deleted from the devices without taking certain steps Those wanting to use the app are asked to accept an enduser license agreement In its separate review Wandera found that users of the app are led to believe pressing a button within the app deletes any collected data and pressing another stops future collectionbut the app doesnt take any such actions A TCL spokesman declined to commentThe Wall Street Journal in July reported that an app from a Taiwanbased mobileadvertising firm included on smartphones sold in Myanmar Cambodia and Brazil collected extensive user data The advertising firm called General Mobile Corp or GMobi was later acquired by the Los Angelesbased digitalad company Airpush Inc Justin Montgomery Airpushs marketing head declined to say what specific data if any GMobi or Airpush now collect If a user purchases a lowercost device they do so with the expectation that certain things will be monetized to help subsidize the cost Mr Montgomery saidUsers in emerging markets are particularly vulnerable to data collection analysts say since they are often firsttime smartphone owners and most developing nations lack robust privacy rulesIn many emerging markets consumers are also less privacyconscious than in the US so they are easy victims or targets said Augustine Fou an independent cybersecurity and

energy,https://www.ft.com/content/b8d24c94-fde7-11e8-aebf-99e208d3e521,2019-01-01 05:00:25,Indian power companies spent much of the past decade rushing to build coalfired power plants in anticipation of surging electricity demand as economic growth took offNow many of those projects are mired in deep financial distress and private investment in coal power has ground to a near halt The sector has been hit by a host of problems many plants have struggled to secure fuel supplies and to clinch deals to sell their power to cashstrapped state distribution companiesBut the biggest driver of longterm uncertainty for the industry is one that few anticipated 10 years ago an explosive takeoff in the renewable power sector as India joins the global push to tackle climate change by shifting towards green energySoon after taking power in 2014 Prime Minister Narendra Modis government set a target of increasing Indias renewable energy capacity by 2022 to 175 gigawatts equivalent to 40 per cent of the countrys total power capacity at the time of the announcementMr Modis ambitions were stoked by a dramatic fall in the price of solar panels after a huge expansion of production in China which is seeking to capitalise on the international drive to cut emissions This was steadily making the cost of electricity from solar plants once far more expensive than coal power more competitive with plants running on the dirtiest fossil fuel In the 2017 financial year newly added renewable energy capacity overtook new coalfired capacity for the first timeThe renewable push attracted major investors such as Japans SoftBank whose consortium last year sealed a deal that stunned the industry It agreed to sell power from a northern Indian solar park for Rs244 per unit well below the cost of coal power which typically costs well over Rs3This shift in the industrys economics means that coal power once one of the hottest prospects for Indian industrialists is now a space where most fear to treadYoud have to be quite courageous to invest in coal at this point said Navroz Dubash of New Delhis Centre for Policy Research The speed with which the story has reversed is quite astonishingIndias move away from coal power has big implications for the global climate Per capita electricity consumption by the countrys 13bn people is just 38 per cent of the global average according to the New Delhibased Energy and Resources Institute with tens of millions of households still lacking grid connections and many more suffering highly inconsistent power supply The government has made the push for reliable universally available electricity a key policy priorityThe scale of the anticipated growth in power demand meant that coal would remain a vital part of the power mix said Sajal Ghosh an energy economist at Gurgaons Management Development Institute In contrast with its heavy reliance on imported oil and gas India has plentiful supplies of coal in its eastern region Until major advances are made in storage largescale coal power will be required to make up for the intermittent nature of renewable electricity with solar plants shutting down at night and wind turbines falling quiet on still daysIndian coal power producers are considering renewable projects when they build new capacity  GettyBut the sector is already moving quickly to respond to the rapid shift in the relative economics of coal and renewables This year staterun NTPC by far the biggest thermal power producer in India has cancelled several plans for large coal projects including one for a giant 4GW plant in southern Andhra Pradesh stateIncreasingly large privatesector coal power producers are looking at renewable projects when they build new capacity Adani Power for example has invested more than 600m in a solar plant in Tamil Nadu a southern state with abundant sunshineThere is no longer an economic case for the highestcost coal plants in inland areas of the countrys south and west which are forced to rely on coal expensively transported over long distances from the northeastern coalfields said Tim Buckley at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial AnalysisBut with a huge stock of newly built or underconstruction coal plants the companies are now forced to question which projects will remain viable in an age of increasingly plentiful renewable power and which may need to be abandonedCredit Suisse estimates that more than half the debt owed by power companies is now stressed with interest payments exceeding profits amounting to a total of more than Rs25tn 35bn Several coalfocused power groups are being dealt with under Indias new bankruptcy code which will force them into liquidation if a swift sale is not agreedIndian authorities have an incentive to minimise the distress in the coal power sector Statecontrolled banks reeling from a surge in nonperforming corporate loans are heavily exposed to this industry A dramatic slowdown in the coal sector would have its own implications for the banking sector in India warned Len George an energy specialist at the Asian Development BankAuthorities desire to prevent large coalfired plants from sliding into distress was reflected this month when the Gujarat government agreed to raise the rates paid for power to two major coal plants run by Adani Tata Power and Essar Power The plants had fallen into heavy losses after a change in Indonesian rules increased the cost of their imported coalThere are a lot of things that would make the government want to prop up coal said Mr Dubash at New Delhis Centre for Policy Research But the prize you get if you unwind this political economy is lower cost power across the country and more competitive Indian industry

decision, which struck a slightly less dovish tone than some investors had anticipated",https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/fed-raises-rates-while-trimming-forecast-for-2019-hikes-to-two,2018-12-19 19:18:29,The Federal Reserve raised borrowing costs for the fourth time this year ignoring a stockmarket selloff and defying pressure from President Donald Trump while dialling back projections for interest rates and economic growth in 2019By trimming the number of rate hikes they foresee in 2019 to two from three policy makers signaled they may soon pause their monetary tightening campaign Officials had a median projection of one move in 2020Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues said economic activity has been rising at a strong rate in a statement Wednesday following a twoday meeting in Washington While officials said risks to their outlook are roughly balanced they flagged threats from a softening world economyThe Federal Open Market Committee will continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the economic outlook the statement saidUS stocks erased most of their gains the dollar rebounded from its lows of the day and benchmark Treasury yields held steady after the Fed signalled additional rate hikes remain warranted striking a slightly less dovish tone than some investors had anticipatedWednesdays unanimous 100 decision lifted the target range for the federal funds rate to 225 per cent to 25 per centThe quarterpoint hike came after Trump assailed the Fed on Twitter for two straight days urging it to hold rates steady in the most public assault on its political independence in decades Investors are also fretting over the economy with the SampP 500 Index falling significantly in recent weeksOfficials also altered key language in their statement saying the FOMC judges that some further gradual increases in rates will likely be needed a shift from previous language saying the FOMC expects that further gradual increases would be requiredIn addition the median estimate among policy makers for the socalled neutral rate in the long run fell to 275 per cent from 3 per cent in the previous forecasts from September The median projection is for the benchmark rate to end 2021 at 31 per cent down from a prior estimate of 34 per centPossible PauseThose are more acknowledgments that rates are moving closer to the point where policy makers will at least take a break from the quarterly procession of hikes they pursued throughout 2018When taken together the latest quarterpoint move language changes and shift in rate projections indicate continued confidence in the economy yet also greater caution over how far and fast the Fed expects to move with future hikes As Powell has said the Fed is now feeling its way forward and will act in line with how the economy performsInvestors have had a more pessimistic view than the Fed foreseeing one increase at most in 2019 according to interest rate futures pricesIn a related move the Fed lifted the interest rate it pays on bank reserves deposited at the central bank by just 20 basis points instead of the usual 25 basis points that would match the quarterpoint increase for the fed funds target range As with a similar move in June the action was aimed at containing the effective fed funds rate inside the target rangePowell will have a chance to hone the central banks message to markets when he holds a press conference at 230 pmCareful BalanceHell be aiming to strike a careful balance expressing a stillpositive view on the US economy without telegraphing a policy outlook that investors might view as too aggressive for an economy that appears somewhat more fragile than just a few months agoWhile job creation has slowed slightly over the past several months it has still easily outstripped the number needed to accommodate population growth Unemployment in November remained at 37 per cent its lowest since 1969 That has helped lift wages but hasnt provoked any serious signs of excessive inflationStill many forecasters expect growth to slow in 2019 and into 2020 and the Feds median estimate for gross domestic product expansion in 2019 fell to 23 per cent from 25 per centPrevious hikes and a stronger dollar will gradually bite into the economy just as fiscal stimulus fades and foreign economies from China to Europe also cool Meanwhile the ongoing trade dispute with China and a potentially chaotic exit for the UK from the European Union represent significant additional risksFinancial markets have been turbulent for weeks with the SampP 500 Index of US stocks dropping 13 per cent from the end of September through Tuesday Yields on 10year US Treasuries have also been volatile dropping to 282 per cent this week after hitting a sevenyear high of 326 per cent

Chapman has joined with a childhood friend to buy a home in Vancouvers expensive housing market The 28yearold financial planner hasnt been able to find a home he wants at a price he can afford on his own despite searching for two yearsHe isnt alone Tougher rules for new borrowers rising mortgage rates and new taxes for home buyers have been put in place by Canadian regulators in recent years to tame some of the most overheated housing markets in the developed world But they have also shut prospective homeowners like Mr Chapman out of the market That has slowed sales in cities like Toronto and Vancouver in recent months prompting some to call for Canada to loosen the restrictions lest they brake the economy too much Evan Siddall a former Goldman Sachs banker who now runs Canadas housing agency is unmoved In fact he doesnt think the tougher rules go far enough Residential real estate has become too large a part of our economy and its diverting investment he said in an interview You cant build a country on making houses for the countryMr Siddall chief executive of Canada Mortgage amp Housing Corporation has publicly backed a slate of tougher mortgage rules in recent years including a requirement for home buyers to prove they can handle interest rates that are either 2 percentage points higher than the mortgage rate offered by their bank or at the fiveyear benchmark rate set by the Bank of Canada whichever is higher Originally meant for borrowers needing mortgage insurance the test has since been expanded to any prospective buyerThe mortgage rules make it more difficult for wouldbe home buyers like Mr Chapman who said they effectively cut his offering price on homes by 20Mr Siddall said regulators could have set the test even higher but that would have been difficult to sell politically The housing agency which fulfills a role in Canada similar toFannie MaeandFreddie Macin the US by securitizing and guaranteeing mortgages also considered recommending limits on how much banks could lend relative to their borrowers income but dropped that idea he saidThe regulations were introduced to quell household borrowing rates that Mr Siddall and other officials say are alarming Average household borrowing of which housing is by far the biggest component was nearly 174 of income as of Sept 30 according to Statistics Canada The proportion is unchanged from the end of last year and down only slightly from a year earlierBy comparison US borrowers topped out at a 124 debttoincome ratio at the end of 2007 just before the financial crisis The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warned in July that the combination of high household debt and high housing prices could lead to a Canadian housing crashWhile Canadas banks and its economy largely escaped the 2008 financial crisis a combination of low interest rates foreign realestate investment and speculation combined to propel house prices in cities like Vancouver and Toronto to what many analysts called bubblelike conditionsTo counter the trend local governments have levied taxes and fees that make it harder for foreign buyers and speculators to buy homes in the overheated Vancouver and Toronto markets Many analysts have cited outside money as a major driver of doubledigit housing price increases in Canadas largest citiesFor the housing industry the rules have been painful Home sales in the Vancouver region plunged more than 42 in November from a year earlier following a 35 drop in October according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver Sales

homeprice index which measures benchmark prices has fallen 2 between June and November though it is still up 27 from three years ago The group predicted that 2019 sales and prices would be held in check by the regulatory changes and rising rates The Canadian Home Builders Association has been calling on the government to repeal or loosen the rules on mortgage lending which are making it unnecessarily difficult for firsttime home buyers said spokesman David Foster We understand why this was done he said But it seems to have done what the government wanted to do and from hereon in mostly what we are going to see are a lot of negative side effects unless that policy is recalibrated and rethoughtHousing starts fell 8 nationally between the second and third quarters according to Statistics Canada And demand for mortgage loans fell 43 in the first nine months of this year from a year earlierThe rules also threaten to worsen income inequality by keeping young families from building wealth said Paul Taylor CEO of Mortgage Professionals Canada an industry group representing mortgage brokers lenders and insurers Steady increases in interest rates are rebalancing the market he said making extra regulations unnecessaryIts a bit of a nanny state when you say We dont think its in your best interest to buy property at that level now said Mr Taylor The Bank of Canada the countrys central bank said in November that the quality of Canadian mortgage loans improved after the latest rules came into effect in January but concerns about household debt remain Household vulnerabilities took a long time to build and so its going to take a long time to come back Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Gov Carolyn Wilkins said during a recent panel discussion at an Ottawa housing conferenceDespite a recent cooling prices are still nearly 40 higher in Toronto and more than 55 higher in the Vancouver area than they were three years ago according to the Bank of Canada The central bank continues to view a housing crash as a key risk to the financial systemThough he is sympathetic to the buyers concerns Mr Siddall said there are other places they can put their money to earn returns The rules protect firsttime buyers from borrowing more than they can afford which would leave them vulnerable if the housing market turns he saidWe had to make it harder for people who were borrowing with too little equity to expose themselves to the housing market And thats firsttime home buyers he said We actually probably could have done moreThat however doesnt help Mr Chapman find a

site.,https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-targets-unprofitable-items-with-a-sharper-focus-on-the-bottom-line-11544965201,2018-12-16 22:09:45,Amazoncom Inc AMZN 401 has trained people to buy everything from major appliances to daily staples online Now it is having second thoughts about some of those sales because they dont make moneyand is pushing big brands to change how they use its site Inside Amazon the items are known as CRaP short for Cant Realize a Profit Think bottled beverages or snack foods The products tend to be priced at 15 or less are sold directly by Amazon and are heavy or bulky and therefore costly to shipcharacteristics that make for thin or nonexistent margins Now as Amazon focuses more on its bottom line in addition to its rapid growth it is increasingly taking aim at CRaP products according to major brand executives and people familiar with the companys thinking In recent months it has been eliminating unprofitable items and pressing manufacturers to change their packaging to better sell online according to brands that sell on Amazon and consultants who work with them One example bottled water from CocaCola Co Amazon used to have a 699 sixpack of Smartwater as the default order on some of its Dash buttons a small device that allows for automatic reordering with a single press But in August after working with CocaCola to change how it ships and sells the water Amazon notified Dash customers it was changing that default item to a 24pack for 3720 That raised the price per bottle to 155 from 117 And CocaCola will start shipping those orders directly to consumers sparing Amazon the expense of shipping from its warehouses Manufacturers shipping from their warehouses is something Amazon has asked more brands to do to cut its own costs Amazon told CocaCola that it was losing money on the smaller cheaper shipments according to people familiar with the matter CocaCola responds that it works with partners to learn together and constantly evolves its offerings Moves like that can increase costs for brands Amazon can get away with it because manufacturers of food and household products are hooked on the online retailers sizeit accounts for a majority of total ecommerce revenue growthsay consultants who work with brands on their online strategy For big consumer brands not being on Amazon is not an option anymore said Guru Hariharan chief executive of Boomerang Commerce which makes ecommerce software They have the power they have the shoppers Amazon also has greater leeway to curb CRaP items because of the rise of independent sellers on its site They have added hundreds of millions of items helping ensure that Amazons virtual shelves are stocked with the variety shoppers expect And those sales tend to be more profitable for Amazon which typically collects a 15 cut plus fees for warehousing Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said earlier this year that eliminating CRaP items is something that we do and work with our vendors on all the time adding that it hasnt caused a change in profitability for the company in 2018 Amazon like other retailers has made changes to inventory when an item isnt selling well and is unprofitable It also has moved some productssuch as its smaller package of Smartwaterinto its Prime Pantry category in which consumers fill up a box with items to reduce the cost of shipping Amazon is trying to boost profitability in its core retail business after years of focusing on growth according to the people The companys profit has risen sharply in the past couple of years helping its stock price soar although its market value has fallen again recently But most of that profitability has stemmed from its growing cloud business and advertising unit Brand executives privately say Amazons push for profitability can be a doubleedged sword Amazon has pressured them to lower prices and change packaging both of which can be costly And eliminating or changing what they sell on Amazon can hurt sales Some executives however say it can help both companies Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep anywhere in the world But the ecommerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire WSJs Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box Seventh Generation a Unilever PLC unit that makes plantbased household products has altered its Amazon selling strategy in recent months after talking with Amazon about improving the profitability of products for sale on the platform said CEO Joey Bergstein Mr Bergstein said his company has developed new product formats that are more profitable to sell onlineon Amazon or elsewhere Amazon is really clear that they have a profitability threshold he said Weve been clear about saying Lets make sure what were selling is profitable and were not just lining Amazons pockets That has meant selling smaller lighter laundry products like detergent pods and skipping cheaper paper towels Instead of promoting a threepack of dish soap Seventh Generation recently started advertising a 6pack for 1770 and it created a larger 504count package of baby wipes for 1991 for sale on Amazon and elsewhere Mars Wrigley Confectionery and Kellogg Co executives said they have seen an uptick in products Amazon has dubbed unprofitable over the past year although they wouldnt say which items But they are taking steps to change Mars for example has seen better success on Amazon in selling bigger bags of Life Savers or Dove Promises a spokeswoman said and it has better figured out how to offer products online that shoppers want for different occasions Campbell Soup Co which like CocaCola ships some products directly to consumers who buy online is revamping packaging for Amazon for items such as Campbells Chunky Soup and Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers which are typically cheap at the store but relatively heavy to ship Campbell now uses predictive technology to monitor pricing dynamics so that it can adjust sizes change the variety or redesign packaging to ensure the products will be profitable enough to stay on Amazon Heather Haddon contributed to this

limits on how much the furniture will actually be rearrangedIn Mr Moonvess case the two were connected He was under pressure to adapt his company entertainment giant CBS for the postNetflix world when a New Yorker investigation of his alleged sexual misbehavior knocked him out of his job Last week to nobodys surprise CBS complied with the zeitgest It decided that his treatment of women during his long career as an executive at the company meant he forfeited his golden parachute A connection between the two tornadoes also exists in the case of actor Kevin Spacey He disappeared unceremoniously from this seasons House of Cards the show that he created and that proved Netflix could prosper strategically by producing its own content Now he faces trial in Massachusetts on a fondling allegation that however gauche is hardly the stuff of a criminal rampage He excited a selfrighteousTwittermob this week by posting a private video of himself as the Frank Underwood character from his Netflix show But once the justice system has rendered a verdict on his case Ill bet even nervous Hollywood executives will start asking how it benefits the world to have Mr Spacey not practicing his craft answer It doesntIdly some of us also wondered after the scandal over Harvey Weinsteins clearly coercive alleged behavior emerged whether the accusing finger might eventually turn on women known to have sought out powerful men to advance their careers So far this scoresettling has not materialized The old order may not be as dead as we thinkThe next round of the streaming revolution may be not be all it was cracked up to be either Two of this years colossal deals were premised on established powers bulking up to take the battle directly to Netflix Disneybought numerous Fox properties while declaring that its nowlarger catalog of Disney shows and movies would no longer appear on Netflix Studios like Disney have long kicked themselves for renting out their content and creating the Netflix monster in the first place Thats why eyebrows went skyward when ATampT which had also promised to challenge Netflix struck a 100 million deal to allow Friendsacquired with ATampTs 85 billion purchase of Time Warnerto continue appearing on Netflix through next year The widely held theory is that emerging Netflix killers should hold back such shows for their own forthcoming streaming services Commentary on ATampTs decision has been almost uniformly negative Was the company which owns HBO already losing its nerveThen again maybe somebody at ATampT is reckoning with the question of whether it really makes sense to try to replicate Netflixs business model given Netflixs giant head start and its 137 million global subscribers How much will it cost Will it be worth it How much revenue from Netflix or other buyers will be forgone in the processThe questions get gnarlier the deeper you look How many steaming services will consumers really support What happens as AmazonAppleGoogle orFacebookwade more deeply into this pond using their huge revenues from unrelated businesses to subsidize their competition for streaming eyeballs For that matter ATampT still has its giant wireless and wired telecom business Isnt streaming destined to be a sweetener in the package of services it offers consumers Wont ATampT in fact find it useful to bundle Netflix in a oneprice offering And when consumers are buying oneprice bundles will they really care or notice that theres overlap in the content they are buyingOur guess is that the future video ecosystem will be a lot more complex than suggested by the Netflix vs clones scenario In public comments ATampT chief Randall Stephenson allowed that he could see a nonexclusive future for FriendsThere will be lots of ways to play lots of frenemies doing business with each other as suppliers competitors and partners simultaneously Netflix in fact may be destined to be everybodys friend as the big generic broadspectrum streamer even as others chart their own streaming courses None of this by the way guarantees that Netflix will ever make loads of money or that the big media deals hatched or closed in 2018 will pay off for

conference calls can give investors analysts and the public a chance to hear directly from a companys management on their outlook or strategy Usually the calls are cautious stagemanaged affairs in which company officials are loathe to go off their script Sometimes however things go a little sideways The Post has compiled five of the most memorable conference call moments of 2018You are an embarrassment to your parentsAnalysts get paid to ask tough questions about corporate strategies but that doesnt always sit well with high powered chief executivesTake for example ClevelandCliffs CEO Lourenco Goncalves who was asked on an October conference call about the US ironore mining companys capital allocation  and unloaded on analysts saying that some cant read numbersYou are a disasterGoncalves said during the call apparently taking issue with one analyst in particular You are an embarrassment to your parentsThe CEO then vowed to reward longterm shareholders and if necessary buy back stock  to the discomfort of anyone not on board with the planWe are going to screw these guys so badly that I dont believe that they will be able to only resign They will have to commit suicide Goncalves assured the analystsAny more questionsBonehead questions are not coolThe blunt style of Elon Musk got the Tesla CEO in trouble a few times this past yearIn May when an analyst began a question about capital requirements during the electric automakers conference call Musk decided apparently that enough was enoughBoring bonehead questions are not cool he said before calling for the next question which also failed to meet his standards Instead of answering it the CEO turned to YouTube for a different kind of inquisitorSorry Musk said These questions are so dry Theyre killing meThe call continued though Musk would later apologize for his outburstWe dont have a view or a bias in that electionPolitics has been an inescapable fact of life at Hydro One since long before its debut on public markets in 2015But any buffer it might have enjoyed as a result of being publicly traded dissolved under the pressure of 2018s provincial electionThe company and CEO Mayo Schmidt put on a brave face even as then Progressive Conservative leader Doug Ford vowed to clean house by firing the sixmilliondollar man and ousting the boardWhen an analyst asked about its governance agreement and election noise during a May conference call about a month before the election Schmidt offered an illfated responseSo were quite frankly looking forward to  getting through the election he said We dont have a view or a bias in that election But the fact is that I think in our view would be once we clear it and the hydro or electricity becomes less of lets say a lightning rod that things will smooth out but were not losing our focus as an organization in the meantimeThose turned out to be famous last words Ford went on to win the election and Schmidts departure followed

expanded by double digits for most of the past decade were supposed to power the Chinese economy for years to come The government counted on them to buoy growth as its planners tried to shift a maturing economy toward services and away from the bigticket infrastructure and smokestack industries that were creating debt and pollutionThe current slowdown stems in part from government policies to hold down housing prices and curb rising levels of mostly corporate debt Additional drag has come from the trade fight between the US and China The two sides have levied punitive tariffs on products that make up 60 of their trade injecting new risk for companies at home and markets abroadTrade frictions with the US disrupted a longstanding belief that Chinas economic expansion will continue albeit at a slower pace thanks to its connection with the rest of the world said Fan Lei an economist at brokerage firm Sealand Securities Now he said worries about the strength of that

tax cuts for businesses and householdsOverall growth for last year is likely to hit the governments annual target of about 65 at least by official statistics and many analysts expect Beijing to set a slightly lower target for this yearSome economists peg actual growth at about half the official rate as exporters manufacturers and other businesses have retrenched in the face of slack demand at home

rate topping 30 in Beijing and Shanghai according to official figures November housing prices in 70 cities were up more than 10 on average compared with a year earlier official data showed with smaller cities seeing the biggest boost Now housing sales by value are beginning to stagnate and property investment is flattening The result has been diminished savings and frayed nerves In recent

forecasts for providing prescriptiondrug benefits to more than 40 million people on MedicareNo one expects the estimates to be spot on After all it is a tall order to predict the exact drug spending for the following year of the thousands of members in each planHowever year after year most of those estimates have turned out to be wrong in the particular way that thanks to Medicares arcane payment rules results in more revenue for the health insurers a Wall Street Journal investigation has found As a consequence the insurers kept 91 billion more in taxpayer funds than they would have had their estimates been accurate from 2006 to 2015 according to Medicare data obtained by the JournalThose payments have largely been hidden from view since Medicares prescriptiondrug program was launched more than a decade ago and are an example of how the secrecy of the 35 trillion US healthcare system promotes and obscures higher spendingMedicares prescriptiondrug benefit called Part D was designed to help hold down drug costs by having insurers manage the coverage efficiently Instead Part D spending has accelerated faster than all other components of Medicare in recent years rising 49 from 629 billion in 2010 to 938 billion in 2017 Medicare experts say the programs design is contributing to that increase Total spending for Part D from 2006 to 2015 was about 652 billion The cornerstone of Part D is a system in which private insurers such asCVS Health CorpUnitedHealth Group IncandHumana Incsubmit bids estimating how much it will cost them to provide the benefit The bids include their own profits and administrative costs for each plan Then Medicare uses the estimates to make monthly payments to the plansAfter the year ends Medicare compares the plans bids to the actual spending If the insurer overestimated its costs it pockets a chunk of the extra money it received from Medicaresometimes all of itand this can often translate into more profit for the insurer in addition to the profit built into the approved bid If the extra money is greater than 5 of the insurers original bid it has to pay some of it back to MedicareFor instance in 2015 insurers overestimated costs by about 22 billion and kept about 106 billion of it after paying back 11 billion to the government according to the data reviewed by the JournalThe companies say the pattern of overestimates the Journal identified is the result of unpredictable drug pricing by pharmaceutical manufacturers Insurers say they strive to make accurate bids which are certified by professional actuaries Medicare reviews and approves all bids and sometimes audits them insurers also point outSome insurers also say some members purchase plans with socalled supplemental benefits richer coverage than what Medicare will pay for Under Medicares rules the impact of that extra spending can lead to bigger discrepancies in the estimates they sayACVSofficial said it is to be expected that companies would be biased toward overestimating costs because we cant have years where we lose money In a statement the company stressed it strives for accuracy when reporting to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or CMS the agency overseeing Part D We take great care to develop and submit the most accurate bid possible to CMS in order to have the lowest possible premium a CVS spokeswoman said in an email A Humana spokesman said in an email that the company has not engineered its bids in such a way as to produce additional profit The Part D program provides a stable and sustainable way for seniors to obtain their medications at an affordable price and the private sector innovation and competition it fosters deliver great value to the government and taxpayers a UnitedHealth spokesman said in an emailThe structure of Medicares prescription benefit program incentivizes insurers to over or underestimate costs depending on who pays for overrunsDirect subsidyInsurers get paid based on their own estimates for the cost of mostly routine drugsWhen actual spending is less than estimates plans keep a share of the extra money Actual costhigher estimatelower estimateWhen actual spending is greater than estimates plans bear some of the lossesReinsurance subsidyMedicare pays separately for some extremely highcost drugs Plans estimate these costs in advance tooWhen this estimate is higher than costs the plan must fully pay Medicare backActual costhigher estimatelower estimateWhen the estimate is lower than costs Medicare fully reimburses the plan for cost overruns Lower estimates here help keep premiums which are based on the total of both estimates lowerSource MedPacCMS said in a statement that risk sharingthe part of the program that can reward overestimatesis based on a statutory formula and that it has taken action to bolster Part D plans negotiating power so that they can get the best deal for patients from prescriptiondrug manufacturers CMS declined to release data to the Journal that would show individual insurers bidding patterns saying it is confidential industry information Separately the Journal obtained the insurers data for a fiveyear period from 2009 to 2013 that shows the patterns of the more than 6000 Part D plans sold during those years The Journal also analyzed aggregate payment data from 2006 to 2015 that has either been published by CMS or obtained via publicrecords requestsA detailed analysis of the confidential industry data obtained by the Journal shows that 69 of Part D members from 2009 to 2013 were in plans that overestimated costs by at least 5 over that time Among many of the largest insurers the rates were higher UnitedHealth overestimated costs by at least 5 for plans covering 93 of its members in the analysisAnthem Incdid so for plans covering 76 of members and Humana did so for plans covering 74 of members Anthem said in a statement we are confident in our compliance track recordThe Journal analysis of 200913 data excluded some plans that arent subject to normal Part D rules including Medicaresubsidized plans backed by employers and some socalled demonstration plans which are pilot projects that test out new ways of delivering or paying for care Those plans are included in the 200615 aggregate records however If those big insurers were aiming to submit accurate bids the probability that they would have overestimated costs so frequently and by such a large amount is less than one in one million according to a statistical analysis done for the Journal by researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who study pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursementMost Medicare beneficiaries were in plans that bid inaccurately in the ways that benefit insurers with extra revenue or lower premiumsAccuracy

truly unpredictable events were blowing up their statistical models the proportion of overestimates to underestimates would be closer to 5050 says Peter Bach director of Sloan Ketterings Center for Health Policy and Outcomes which conducted the statistical analysisEven expert dart throwers dont hit the bullseye every time But their misses are spread around in every direction says Dr Bach If they start missing in one particular direction over and over they are doing it on purposeThe Medicare Payment Advisory Commission an independent congressional agency wrote in 2015 that insurers inaccurate estimates show consistent patterns rather than the randomness one might expect from projection errors in the actuarial assumptions behind bidsThe Part D drug benefit was passed into law in 2003 and launched in 2006 Congress designed the program so that it would be paid for by taxpayers and the seniors who enroll in it but operated entirely by privatesector companies The private health insurers that run Part D negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies and compete to sell coverage to seniors For standard drug coverage under the program Medicare pays threequarters of the costs and seniors who join pay monthly premiums covering the remaining roughly 25That marketbased design was supposed to reward insurers that hold drug spending low with greater market share and penalize those whose costs come in higher than budgeted The programs designers expected insurers to keep their total bids as low as possible in order to keep premiums low Big overestimates they thought would deter costconscious customers by leading to higher premiumsBut a wrinkle in the programs design allows plans to reap higher revenue from overbiddingwhile also keeping premiums lowWE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOUDo you know the price of your medical care Tell us about itInsurers bids are split into two separate cost estimates The twoguess system was designed by legislators who worried private companies wouldnt participate in their new insurance market To entice them Congress sought to stem the risk of big losses if they made miscalculations For one chunk of costs called the direct subsidy insurers and Medicare share the risk based on a complicated formula For the other chunk called the reinsurance subsidy Medicare bears it allIt is with the direct subsidy which mostly covers routine costs that overestimates can pay off For starters insurers that overestimate costs keep any extra money up to 5 of their guess and some of money beyond that 5 based on a Medicare formula A high guess here leaves insurers with extra money Those that underestimate can face losses of up to 5 Medicare steps in to partially offset losses over that initial 5 With the reinsurance subsidy which covers the governments share of spending on a subset of patients with extremely high drug costs Medicare bears all the risk for a wrong guess Plans that overestimate pay all the extra money back and ones that underestimate get fully reimbursed by Medicare Since this guess is also part of the total cost estimate that member premiums are based on a low guess here can help hold premiums down with no risk to the insurerThe confidential data the Journal reviewed shows plans across the board guess wrong in the way that most benefits them in both cases Around 46 of all Part D members in the Journals analysis were in plans that overestimated the first guess and underestimated the second one from 2009 to 2013 By contrast only about 1 of members were in plans that did the oppositeAcross all insurers direct subsidy estimates were high by 176 billion and plans kept an extra 91 billion from 2006 to 2015 according to the Journals analysis of CMS data published online and obtained via a publicrecords requestReinsurance subsidy estimates across all insurers were low by 278 billion and Medicare paid the plans back all of it according to public CMS dataCompanies said they frequently underestimated reinsurance costs because of a steady rise in the use of expensive medicines for chronic conditions like rheumatoid arthritis They also said the aggregate public data includes some employerbacked plans that are subject to different rules and inflate the total reinsurance payback figurePlan sponsors have been able to keep part of catastrophic benefit spending out of enrollee premiums and receive the full reinsurance amounts due to them according to MedPac the independent congressional agency Even though the plan must return some of its direct subsidy profit to Medicareit still nets a portion of profits MedPac wrote in the same 2015 report to CongressWHY AMERICANS SPEND SO MUCH ON HEALTH CARESome of the largest Part D insurers had higherthanaverage rates of estimating wrongly in both areas despite ostensibly having the most data and resources to accurately forecast spending Companies with the most market information should in theory have an advantage in predicting costs and constructing bids according to economists and actuariesUnitedHealth simultaneously overestimated its direct subsidy costs and underestimated the governments reinsurance subsidy triggering extra revenue for the company and extra costs for the government in plans covering more than half of its membership in the analysis which averaged 63 million annually from 2009 to 2013 The proportion of members in plans where UnitedHealth got it wrong the other way by underestimating the direct subsidy and overestimating the reinsurance subsidy was less than a thousandth of 1Humana bid inaccurately in the first way in plans covering 47 of its membership in the analysis while bidding the opposite way in plans with just 01 of its membersCVSwhich covered about 34 million members in its Part D plans included in the analysis at the end of this fiveyear periodoverestimated its direct subsidy costs and underestimated the governments reinsurance subsidy across 63 of its membership the Journals analysis found Just 05 of its members were in plans where CVS did the opposite Across all of CVSs plans from a longer time period the company kept extra money from the direct subsidy payments in five of seven years from 2009 to 2015 and received an average of 5139 million annually in extra reinsurance payments according to data provided by CVS to the Journal for years that havent yet been made public by CMS and the data separately obtained by the Journal The data show that CVS kept extra money from the direct subsidy again in 2016 but that its 2017 bid underestimated the direct subsidy costs CVS overestimated its reinsurance costs in both of these years and as a result paid back the government money in each yearCMS the Medicare agency said recent data suggest that on average plans estimates of future costs in their bids are closer to their actual costs resulting in a significant decline in revenue retained by Part D plansUnitedHealth Humana and CVS combined covered nearly half of all Part D members during the 200913 periodThe Obama and Trump administrations have both proposed slashing the reinsurance subsidy and increasing plans risk for patients with very high drug costs The proposal also advocated by MedPac has some industry support CVS said it backs the change The change can be made only by an act of Congress and legislators arent actively considering itWrite to

way with the December jobs report and an unprecedented panel of Federal Reserve leadership Fed Chairman Jerome Powell sits down with former fed chairs Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke at an economics conference Friday morningSince the Fed is one of the major worries for the market Powells comments could change the tone for investors very quickly Powell jolted markets after his last postmeeting briefing Dec 19 when he said the Feds balance sheet rolloff was on autopilot a surprise to those who expected more flexibility from the Fed given worsening financial conditions and recession fearsThe December employment report Friday morning is expected to show 180000 jobs were created up from 155000 in November according to Thompson Reuters Wages are expected to grow by about 3 percent yearonyear and the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 37 percentBut first stocks will exit 2018 and their final performance for the year Monday could be anyones guess after the massive intraday volatility of the past week The Dow had its best day ever with a more than 1000 point gain Wednesday following its worst Christmas Eve wipeout ever with a loss of more than 600 Dow points in a halfday sessionI think if we didnt see the low we saw something pretty close to it I think its okay to start buying on weak days  on days when its rallying hard maybe just stand pat said Jim Paulsen chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group Thats what I would be looking at doing I think sometime in 2019 if you buy down here in this area youll probably be happyStocks were up across the board in the past week The SampP 500 rose 29 percent to end at 2485 Friday and the Dow was up 27 percent at 230622018 was a year of surprises with a selloff in the fourth quarter that was not expected by Wall Street forecasters For the month of December the SampP was off more than 10 percent and the yeartodate decline was about 7 percent the worst performance since 2008Its a weird thing to have this happen in the holiday season I dont know what that means Does it make it more like its a false dive  or is it more signaling I dont know I cant find another period like this said Paulsen The strategist said hes now recommending buying dips again a strategy that was abandoned by investors as stocks slumped in DecemberYoure going to see ups and downs now at least for awhile I dont think its going to be months but for the next couple of weeks its going to be volatile Its still weird to see that happening at one of the best months of the year when players arent around said PaulsenAs stocks moved both higher and lower Friday Treasury yields which move opposite price were mostly lower The 2year yield slid to 255 percent while the 10year was at 271 percentThe bond market is discounting the idea the Fed is going to continue raising rates said Andrew Brenner of National Alliance The first opportunity you have to see whether theyre right or wrong is next Friday when Powell gives a major speech on the economyPowell is attending the American Economic Association and Allied Science Association Meeting in Atlanta and will appear on the panel with Bernanke and Yellen at 10 am ETBrenner said he expects January to be a rough month for stocks What could change that is Powell depending on what he says next Friday said Brenner He could turn that on a dime  I think January unless the Fed really blinks hard is going to be a very bad monthBrenner said fund reallocation could continue to have an important influence on the market Monday after stocks saw a big impact in the past week as pension funds and others bought equities to rebalance their holdings by the end of DecemberThis is real money These guys dont care whats going on in the market They have a formula that says they have to be at X percent equities X percent fixed income he saidWells Fargo estimated that pensions could have to buy as much as 64 billion in equities into yearend After Monday markets are closed until Wednesday morning for the New Years holiday Typically the first couple of days of the new year are positiveIt should be less wild but that depends on the news if you get any White House tweets and stuff like that said Art Cashin UBS director of floor operations According to the old timers handbook the first couple of days should be higher because of new money for the new year but this has been wackyMarkets will also be watching developments in the continuing government shutdown and on the trade negotiations with China expected to start up again in January

in.,https://www.wsj.com/articles/interpreting-the-trump-meteor-11545179562,2018-12-19 00:32:43,Nobody exaggerated Donald Trumps Russia ties like Mr Trump himself when he claimed early in the 2016 campaign I know Putin He didnt know Putin Mr Putin never gave him the time of day Recall that we started down todays investigatory whirlpool as a direct result of Hillary Clinton and the Democrats seizing on Russia as an excuse for their loss to a president whom many considered a joke Now poor Adam Schiff incoming head of the House Intelligence Committee is trying to catch up with the new Democratic theme Mr Trumps real sin is not Russian collusion after all Its his tawdry but wellknown business and personal lifeNot only must Mr Schiff dream up some way to justify his committees fishing in these waters His new patter also has to shed a semicredible backglow on his earlier role as chief flogger of nowdefunct Russian conspiracy theories He would have benefited from an aide whispering in his ear when he was making his pitch to a New Yorker writer What should concern us most he explained to the magazine is anything can have a continuing impact on the foreign policy and nationalsecurity policy of the United States and if the Russians were laundering money for the Trump Organization that would be totally compromisingHuh For the Russians to be laundering money for him Mr Trump would need a large source of underthetable cash from somewhere his NBC show What the confused Mr Schiff presumably means is that Mr Trump was laundering money for Russiansie selling them condos Never mind that the entire Western financial system also participated in this business opportunity Now it will be one more legal jeopardy in the swirl of investigations around the White HouseStill the media will have to work hard to flap away the odor of selective prosecution Mr Trump was already an unusually heavily scrutinized figure Now hes attracting the kind of subatomic legal scrutiny reserved only for presidents of the opposite party when the press is inveterately hostile too Example the New York Times reauditing his familys heavily audited tax returns to find a welter of abuses that somehow escaped the IRS and New York tax departmentYou can argue whether this is fair or wise but thats our system and a US political party was poorly advised to nominate somebody with Mr Trumps baggage in the first placeThis column has long maintained that a highlevel Russian criminal conspiracy is the one thing investigators wont find when loosed on Mr Trumps colorful business and personal history I especially have to laugh over the somber and knowing suggestions that the Russians have dirt on Mr Trump Every thirdtier swimsuit model and exPlaymate from here to Las Vegas probably has dirt on Mr Trump  Michael Cohens reported admission that the Trump Organization was pursuing Russian opportunities well into 2016 campaign is a smoking gun all right but not of Russian collusion Why did Mr Trump run for president in the first place To become more famous to add gaudy luster to his brand He had no expectation of winning Of course he used the campaign spotlight to market himself for deals in which others would pay to use his nameWinning was his colossal if propitious miscalculation Nobody would care about Stormy Daniels if he werent president His decadeslong pursuit of a Trump Tower in Moscow would be a nonstory Nobody would be raking him over the emoluments coals for owning a hotel in WashingtonUnfortunately it will also occur to Mr Trump now that his best move is to cling to the White House at all costs Thats because under Justice Department guidelines he can expect not to be indicted as long as he remains in office I wonder if his Torquemadas have taken this into accountThe moment is turning weird Even President Obama stepped forward to tidy up the scene by claiming that the inconvenient Trump boom is really the Obama boom By all lights the media should have treated this as laughable Had a Republican leg of lamb been victorious on election night 2016 markets would have priced upward on the news that the Obama agenda was finished Investors arent clairvoyant but they respond to unexpected information And seldom in history have circumstances conspired to give so clear a verdict on an outgoing administrationWhen its all over this will be one lesson worth holding on to Mr Trumps personal fight for survival is likely to dominate our politics for the foreseeable future And yet if anything justified his election in the first place it was the wakeup call from 63 million voters to Americas leadership class Alas its hard to listen to people like James Comey and Mr Obama himself and not see our political system trying hard to expel Mr Trump so it can go back to doing exactly what it was doing before he was elected

battlefields of the Middle East threatening even the most sophisticated battle tanks and highlighting a gap in US military preparednessThe weaponsantitank guided missiles or ATGMswere first developed decades ago but recent years have brought advances in their technology ease of use and availability on the battlefield making them a fearsome and littleacknowledged threat to US troopsThe proliferation is largely the result of efforts of powers such as the US Russia and Iran to arm and train proxy fighters including by sending them antitank missiles along with other weaponryA US program begun in mid2013 provided weapons including ATGM missiles to rebels fighting the Assad regime in Syria President Trump later canceled the program saying in a 2017 interview with The Wall Street Journal that it allowed weapons to fall into al Qaeda handsThere is absolutely the possibility that the US may face some of the same ATGMs it has delivered in the past to the Middle East said Omar Lamrani a senior military analyst with the Austin Texasbased defenseintelligence firm Stratfor Islamic State and al Qaeda offshoots among others now possess Americanmade missiles he addedThose and other nonstate actors in the Middle East also have antitank missilessome of them based on US designsmanufactured in Bulgaria China France Iran and Russia according to analysts who track weapons proliferation Unlike a typical rocketpropelled grenade which has a range of a few hundred yards and cant be steered a modern ATGM typically is fired from a mile or more away and then directed to its target using videogamelike controlsThe modern ATGM can penetrate 1000 millimeters or more of coldrolled steel plate said John Gordon an analyst with Rand Corp adding that nothing on the battlefield is safe from a weapon able to blast through 3 feet of armor These things are now in the hands of groups like ISIS the Taliban and Hezbollah and increasing numbers of nonstate military forcesMilitaries have continually upgraded tanks and other armored vehicles to try and keep pace with threats but the newest missiles outmatch most armor And the missiles arent a threat only to tanks fighters have been documented using them against other targets The Army is now fasttracking a program to equip combat vehicles with advanced armor designed to counter the ATGM threat While Mr Trump has ordered the withdrawal of US forces from Syria there are currently more than 2000 US troops there along with an estimated 5000 in Iraq 14000 in Afghanistan and others around the Middle East and Africa Israel has become a world leader in devising protection against these weapons having faced missile proliferation threats for more than a decade American forces have been fighting enemies during that time that more commonly used improvised explosive devices mines and rocketpropelled grenades rather than missilesThe Israelis have an environment where they have an immediate threat that has been driving their development Most of the time that we were in Iraq and Afghanistan we werent too concerned about antitank guided missiles said Col Glenn Dean project manager for the Armys Stryker Brigade Combat TeamTwo Israeli companies have taken the lead in developing and fielding what is known as active protection or active armor which isnt really armor at all It is a hightech system that uses sensors to detect an incoming missile and shoot back at it destroying the threat midflightIn 2009 as the Israelis leapt ahead with the technology the Pentagon mothballed a multibilliondollar Army program known as the Future Combat Systems which featured active armor The army has worked on this technology since the 1950s but eventually came to rely primarily on an Israeli armor system for its toptier battle vehicles and slowed development of homegrown technologyWhen you stop the future activity you fall back on the current investments you have and that current investment was not good Col Dean said Its not that the need wasnt seen said Mr Lamrani of Stratfor Its just that developing this system and equipping a broad fleet of vehicles is expensive and the technology wasnt developed Army officials and military analysts blame the stalled armor programs in part on the Armys complex acquisition system which the current Army chief of staff Gen Mark Milley has said he wants to streamline President Trump in December chose Gen Milley to become the next chairman of the Pentagons Joint Chiefs of StaffIn 2014 the Army launched a program to fasttrack development of armor systems for a variety of vehicles Wayne Beutler associate director of the Armys Ground Vehicle Survivability project said the program is now yielding results in part by figuring out why previous programs didnt deliverWhile the Army works on a homegrown solution the US military continues to rely on commercial systems particularly from Israeli companies for its active protection needs Earlier this year the Army canceled a USbased companys bid to arm the Stryker fighting vehicle citing underperformance in testsWrite to Ben Kesling at benjaminkeslingwsjcom

equality,https://www.ft.com/content/67966c52-0201-11e9-99df-6183d3002ee1,2018-12-28 04:00:24,As the number of female chief executives in the UKs top 350 listed companies shrinks questions are being raised about the effectiveness of gender pay gap reporting now in its second year in changing corporate behaviour and pushing progressCampaigners for workplace diversity hoped the new reporting rules would compel employers to narrow the gap swiftly but so far there is little evidence that this is happening A Financial Times analysis of the data submitted by more than 600 employers reveals that the gap barely narrowed between April 2017 and 2018With four months to go until the deadline for employers to report their April 2018 numbers 6 per cent of employers have so far reported and the data they have submitted shows a median pay gap of 114 per cent a small decline from 118 per cent a year agoMeanwhile research by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission which is responsible for enforcing compliance with the gender pay gap reporting said that just one in five employers of 440 it sampled had produced an action plan in tandem with their data as the government hoped all would do Only just over one in 10 had set themselves targets to measure progress on these plansRebecca Hilsenrath chief executive of the EHRC said the commission was calling on the government to make publication of action plans mandatory As we head towards the second year of reporting the attention now needs to shift towards employers who must play their part in reducing the gap starting with publicly setting out how they intend to address it she saidPeter Cheese chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said that although the reporting had provided a much needed focus on the gender balance issue it was not enough for companies to just publish their figures and then forget about it for another yearHe said the fact that only a third of employers had published any narrative with their pay gap figures and then of very variable quality must cast doubt as to how seriously the gender pay gap is being taken by many organisationsA failure to publish action plans or to narrow the pay gap is not the only indication of very slow progress towards gender equality in UK workplacesResearch by executive recruitment company Spencer Stuart recently revealed that in the FTSE 100 the proportion of women on executive committees was 186 per cent this year compared with 194 per cent in 2017 In addition the percentage of allmale executive committees has more than doubled from 76 per cent to 157 per centMeanwhile the governmentbacked HamptonAlexander review reported in November that although slow but steady progress was being made in increasing the number of women on the boards of the UKs largest listed companies the number of female chief executives in the FTSE 350 had fallen from 15 to 12 during the yearNearly twothirds of appointments went to men and at the current rate the reviews target of 33 per cent women on boards the executive committee and direct reports to the executive committee by 2020 is unlikely to be metAnn Francke chief executive of the Chartered Management Institute said gender pay gap reporting had raised awareness but given the slow rate of progress we need more than thatWe need transparency with teeth by requiring firms to set and share targets action plans and progress and by imposing meaningful consequences for those who dont she said This is where greater government or regulatory intervention could help accelerate resultsPart of the challenge has been that those responsible for administering and overseeing gender pay gap reporting have experienced significant leadership and institutional change over the past two yearsThe role of minister for women and equalities has been switched three times from Justine Greening to Amber Rudd to the current holder Penny Mordaunt Ms Mordaunt has moved the Government Equalities Office which administers gender pay gap reporting and has shifted department in tune with the ministerial merrygoround to a permanent home in the Cabinet Office In the process she has also changed its focusMs Mordaunt has said that while the GEO had made progress towards closing the gender pay gap and getting more women on the boards in top companies lowpaid lowskilled women were often left out of the conversationI will be shifting the focus of the GEOS work to look at how we can help women who are economically inactive women in low paid and low skilled jobs and women on legacy benefits trapped into limiting their hours or income and women facing multiple barriers to being independent she said in NovemberCampaigners for workplace diversity say the change in focus will weaken the governments commitment to reducing the gender pay gap already overshadowed by Brexit yet furtherIts great that the GEO has a permanent home and these are worthy new priorities said one expert who works closely with government But no one disagrees with this focus whereas getting more senior women is more controversial It means the government risks taking its eye off the ball when it comes to the gender pay gapThe GEO said As the Minister for Women and Equalities said in November this is a broadening out of GEOs focus which will see the GEO supporting women who are cleaning offices as well as the occupants of those offices It is not a case of either or the GEO can do both to make sure gender equality becomes a reality in the workplaceOther campaigners have queried both the efficacy and the cost of the gender pay gap reporting website In November the government revealed that designing and building it had cost 235mJulian Jessop chief economist at the Institute of Economic Affairs said this was a relatively small amount of taxpayers money but the bigger concern was the burden on businesses themselves especially the smaller companies where these data were less meaningful anyway Of course these costs could still be justified if GPG reporting were providing real economic or social benefits but the jury must surely be out he saidMeanwhile the EHRC is currently the subject of an inquiry by the women and equalities committee which is looking into its known problems with enforcement The committee is also taking evidence on the implications of transferring the GEO to the Cabinet Office and its accountabilityIn October the UK government announced it would consult over a new requirement for employers to report their ethnicity pay gap as well as their gender pay gapsIn December research by recruitment company Green Park found that 48 or almost half of FTSE 100 companies had no nonwhite board or executive committee members and at current rates of change companies would not meet a government target of at least one BAME member by 2021 until 2066Green Park said efforts to improve leadership diversity in big corporations were paying dividends but only if youre female and mostly if youre white It said BAME representation among the FTSE 100s top 10000 leaders this year was worse than last meaning the pipeline of nonwhite future chief executives was also shrinkingThe research found that although there had been a 17 percentage point rise in BAME representation over the past year the number of companies with no minority board and executive committee members was down only marginally on the total five years ago when they numbered 53Stripping out nonexecutive directors 67 of the UKs largest listed companies still had an allwhite leadership team up from 65 five years ago BAME executives accounted for only five chief executives three chief financial officers and two chairsTrevor Phillips who chairs Green Park and formerly chaired the Equality and Human Rights

artificial intelligences promise to help marketers reach consumers in ways that are better faster and cheaper executives can wind up wasting time and money when they actually try it according to industry experts and analysts Every marketer wants to be famous and wants to say Im using AI said Stphane Brub chief marketing officer for Western Europe at LOral SA But they also think theyre experts on the topic just because theyve been to a few conferences he said Instead of saying What can I do with AI they need to say Heres what I would like to do with my dialogue or relationship with consumers and can AI help The challenges continue from there Picking Battles Marketers think the technology is the hardest aspect of AI said Mr Brub I think its the easy part The tough part is finding the purpose LOral could have better thought out the chatbot it introduced last year to encourage people to buy products as gifts Mr Brub said It asks both potential giftgivers and the potential recipients a series of questions before suggesting options The consumer experience ended up being a bit complex he said LOral improved that bot over time Mr Brub added and introduced a virtual skin expert this year with stronger traction It developed both bots with Automatai which builds conversational marketing bots for brands LOral also has found success with AI in areas such as using image recognition to enable virtual product testing and skin analysis fueled by its acquisition this year of augmented reality and AI company ModiFace he said How can a consumer be on her phone at home or wherever in a store and be able to try a product without necessarily trying it Its tempting to spend time and money on something sexy like a skill for a home voice assistant when unglamorous applications could pay off better said Sucharita Kodali vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research When Im in the middle of a grocery store why cant I shout or talk and say Hey Kroger where is the light brown sugar she said Voice exists and there are use cases that I have in the store but nobody has married that together to provide something thats useful to me Ms Kodali added Those solutions unfortunately are built by Silicon Valley bros who often dont even understand what customers want and therefore dont build useful solutions Retailers are more effectively using machine learning to prevent fraudulent transactions Ms Kodali said Those are things that are pretty categorically strong investments Choosing Partners Brands are panning for gold in a flood of AI promises from vendors that might not have the expertise necessary to deliver Most of them have no idea how the technology truly works and dont have the talent required to put it into practice said Andy Mauro cofounder and chief executive of Automatai And thats where you get into trouble A marketer should put two questions to any AI vendor Mr Mauro said How many PhDs are on staff and does the company focus on the marketers category Theres no free lunch in any of this he said In order to do a good job in AI there does need to be a certain degree of specialization Committing Testing is wise at the start but too much caution can be counterproductive executives said We see clients that say Oh my God this is available lets do a test said Or Shani founder and CEO of Albert Technologies which offers an AI marketing platform to brands And they give you the worst brand they have in the worst market they have and then they dont understand why it doesnt work Commitment also requires marketers to prepare their teams to welcome the machines Mr Shani said They sign off and we start dealing with their marketing team or media team and they see us as a massive threat he said They need to do some internal education to make sure people understand Guys this is online to make your jobs better Setting Limits When the fashion design house Natori Co deployed AI from Albert Technologies to optimize its advertising in social media the return on its ad spending soared according to Ken Natori president of the company But there was a problem Some people commented that we looked like a discount website because so many sale items were being advertised on Facebook Mr Natori said Albert was increasing the number of sale ads that Natori ran because they were workinga reasonable response for a system instructed to maximize ad performance But Albert didnt consider whether too many sale ads could hurt a brands image We said Listen guys love the return here but the percentage of ads that are promoting sale product is too high and were not comfortable what its doing for our brand Mr Natori said The company fixed the mix by setting some limits Write to Nat Ives at nativeswsjcom

some of their most exciting devices ever in 2018 Here are the ones that caught our eye based on their combination of attractive hardware good battery life and excellent cameras Apple iPhone XS MaxThe

list in terms of design quality and capability The 6T is attractive and modern offering more bang for the buck One of the phones most novel features is the fingerprint reader Rather than reserve a special area of the phone for the fingerprint reader OnePlus used new techniques that allow fingerprints to be read through the display Neat trick It makes for a cleaner designThe 6T also brings

House hoping to convince the nation of President Trumps unfitness for officethough it is hard to imagine what they could possibly unearth that would be more damaging than what is already known Alternately they could try to abolish US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and replace private health insurance with government coverage convincing not one new voter or the Senate to join them A more effective strategy would be for House Democrats to take Mr Trumps populist campaign rhetoric seriously and seek to divide him from his more conventional Republican colleagues on the HillAs candidate and as president Mr Trump repeatedly claimed his tax reforms would not benefit the wealthy and railed against big Wall Street banks and tech giants Populist Democrats can help the president make good on his promisesand make Republicans shriekby proposing a financialtransaction tax and a revenue tax on tech companies Theyd be following Europes lead Democrats can force the issue by ending the carriedinterest tax break another of Mr Trumps campaign promises That new revenue would reduce annual deficits and make a down payment on another Trump campaign promise eliminating the nations debt in eight years Contrasting themselves with supposed smallgovernment congressional Republicans who presided over a 779 billion budget deficit during the last fiscal year Democrats can be the party of fiscal responsibility expanding government while reducing the deficit There is no law mandating they spend all the new revenue they raiseMr Trump has repeatedly criticized AmazonFacebookand Google and House Democrats can assist the Justice Department in pursuing antitrust reviews of the largest technology companies Just as withdrawing troops from Syria has angered traditional Republicans while pleasing Mr Trumps more isolationist populist base a push for greater tech oversight would frustrate traditional Republicans deregulatory agenda Democrats are mad at Big Tech for being asleep at the wheel during the 2016 election while Republicans are concerned by biased search results and censorship of conservatives Republicans have protected the internet from taxation since Newt Gingrich was speaker only to see the companies locate in blue locales and donate almost exclusively to Democrats Populists in both parties share privacy concerns for US citizensnot to mention what China can do with the data it gets from tech companies Steve Bannon even suggested that users data should be controlled by a public trustMr Trump has compared Americas infrastructure to that of a Third World country Why dont House Democrats help him deliver his promised 1 trillion plan for roads ports transit the grid and more This time around Democrats could eschew the Solyndras and other political pipe dreams avoid making unrealistic shovel ready promises and instead stick to locally vetted projects These projects would also create wellpaying construction jobs and help a broad array of communities and workers including union members The Democrats could start by supporting the Keystone pipeline which is privately financed But that might be too much populism for their environmentalist financial backersIn foreign policy Mr Trump has promised to put America first House Democrats can ignore their own multilateralhappy elites and help the president implement his policy in a way that is popular with their base and makes some Republican leaders squirm Democrats can support tariffs on China until it reforms its intellectualproperty and monetary policies and make trade deals with Mexico and other countries contingent on raising their wages Sens Chuck Schumer Sherrod Brown and other prounion Democrats have been advocating these kinds of positions for years Next conditioning support of the North Atlantic Treaty Organizaiton on European allies paying more for their defense would have the salutary effect of freeing up money for other priorities Just because Mr Trump agrees with their positions does not mean Democrats have to abandon them House Democrats could even try to drive a wedge between Mr Trump and the Republicans populist base They could join Republicans in sanctioning Russia over its Crimea incursion and pressure the Saudis on human rights especially religious liberty Democrats also could support Sen Rand Pauls efforts to rein in executive power overseas At home they can make entitlement programs more progressive by raising the cap on taxable earnings for Social Security and raising and meanstesting premiums and costsharing for Medicare while attacking inequality as an obstacle to growthGiven the realities of divided government House Democrats are not likely to succeed in enacting these policies They can succeed however in heightening the tension between Mr Trumps populist instincts and conservative orthodoxy showing that populism does not have to be a uniquely Republican force in 2020 And dont worry that these policies could cause more harm than benefit House Democrats are unlikely to resist the temptations of impeachment and prioritize substance over styleMr Jindal served as governor of Louisiana 200816 and was a candidate for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination

twice as long as they used to and its all because James Rogers didnt listen to his motherdiv gt divgroup gt pfirstchildgtRogers is the founder and CEO of Apeel Sciences a Southern Californiabased food technology startup that is trying to battle food waste Its a problem that the United Nations estimates costs the world roughly 26 trillion each year much of which stems from fruits vegetables and other perishable foods going bad before theyre consumedRogers Apeel recently named to the 2018 CNBC Disruptor 50 List thinks it can combat the problem of food waste with its primary product Edipeel a tasteless odorless edible coating made from plant materials Edipeel can keep produce like avocados or oranges from going bad for weeks longer than usual it can double the shelf life in some cases even without refrigerationThe trick to keeping produce from spoiling Rogers tells CNBC Make It is relatively simple The two leading causes of produce spoilage are water loss and oxidation thats water evaporating out of the produce and oxygen getting in Rogers saysThe point of the Edipeel coating is simply to act as a physical barrier that slows down the evaporation process and regulates how much oxygen gets into produce And because Apeel makes its invisible coating out of the fatty acids and other organic compounds taken from the peels seeds and pulp of other fruits and vegetables the FDA has deemed it safe to eat Avocados sprayed with Edipeel are already being sold at grocery stores like Kroger Costco and Harps Food Stores across the USOur philosophy is The only thing that belongs on food is food Rogers tells CNBC Make ItRogers founded Apeel in 2012 and the company has raised a total of 110 million in funding from investors who include the Bill amp Melinda Gates Foundation as well as investment firms Viking Global Investors and Andreessen HorowitzRogers 33 got the idea for Apeel when he was working on his PhD in materials science at UC Santa Barbara where he was trying to develop a solar paint that could harvest the suns energy much like solar panels One day in 2012 he was driving between Santa Barbara and the universitys Berkeley Lab and he was listening to a podcast about world hunger while looking out at acre after acre of abundant farmland He wondered why so many people in the world were going hungry roughly one in 10 people when the world actually produces more than enough food to feed everyone on the planetThe problem came down to distribution Rogers says he came to learn We couldnt get the food that was being grown to where the people were who need to eat it And so I was curious what precludes us from distributing food and it all comes down to this notion of perishabilityRogers started researching how water loss and oxidation spoil produce and it reminded him of how the steel industry uses coatings to prevent metal from rusting He thought he could come up with a similar solution to coat produce and prevent fruits and vegetables from spoiling so quicklyIt was kind of a wild idea especially considering Rogers had no agricultural experience which is exactly what his mother told him when he called her and explained his idea for fighting world hunger by inventing a protective coating for produceI called my mom and I said Hey Mom I got this idea for a company Rogers tells CNBC Make It And she said That sounds really nice but you dont know anything about about fruits and vegetablesRogers had to admit that his mother was right but he didnt let that stop him from diving into his idea He went to the library and checked out a pile of books about the biology of plantsIn fact he learned enough that he was able to flesh out his idea and apply for a research grant from the Bill amp Melinda Gates Foundation which gave him 100000 that marked the beginning of Apeel Rogers hired two researchers he knew from his PhD program and they got to work developing the product that would become EdipeelSix years later Rogers has legitimate hope that Apeel can make a real difference in fighting the global hunger epidemic Apeels business is starting to take off thanks to selling Edipeel to major fruit and vegetable producers like Del Rey Avocado Horton Fruit and Eco Farmsand and partnering with US retailers who currently lose more than 18 billion a year due to wasted food But Apeel is also working with farmers in Kenya and Nigeria where Edipeel is awaiting regulatory approval in order to help them keep their produce fresh long enough to be transported from rural areas to larger markets where they can feed the local populationAt the moment Apeels coating is only being sold on avocados but the company is also working on selling Edipeel to produce growers to use on asparagus and various citrus fruits among other produce The Edipeel formula differs for each variety of fruit or vegetable because the product is derived from the materials of the very produce its meant to protectLooking back now Rogers can chuckle at the fact that his mom initially threw cold water on his produce plans But he says theres an important lesson in that story Dont not do something because theres a part of it you dont know about he tells CNBC Make ItInstead of giving up because youre not fully versed on something even if its a major aspect of what you want to do you can just commit to learning more and filling in those gaps in your knowledge Rogers says Its oftentimes the combination of the stuff that you know about and the willingness to learn the stuff that you dont know about which leads to some really cool innovationsDont Miss Kevin

spending,https://www.ft.com/content/77169e62-0158-11e9-99df-6183d3002ee1,2018-12-16 19:29:50,President Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador failed his first market test when he shocked investors with plans to scrap a partially built 13bn airport project But he appears to have learnt his lesson by presenting a fiscally prudent 2019 budget that sticks to a key surplus goal Finance Minister Carlos Urza stuck to his 1 per cent primary surplus target even though the context kept on changing with a worsening economic outlook higher rates and a weaker peso said Alonso Cervera economist at Credit Suisse Markets would have been very disappointed had he lowered it Benito Berber at Natixis noted that after a peoples poll at the end of October sealed the airports fate and roiled markets Mr Urza bumped up his primary surplus estimate to 1 per cent from a previously indicated 08 per cent level They wanted to do something about their lack of credibility in the market the peso depreciation and bond yields going upit was very important that they delivered on that he said It looks that there is a reasonable hand making the budget very different from the guys pushing to cancel the airport said one former senior government official The tide is turning the US and China could go into recession interest rates are rising so financing for emerging markets will get a lot more complicated How are we preparing for it Are you making sure youre meeting your fiscal goals It looks a bit less likely and at a time when Mexico needs to send the message to investors that were still a serious country that you dont want to pull out of The 2019 austerity budget presented to Congress on Saturday night reassigned spending towards promised welfare and infrastructure projects and contained no new taxes It targeted growth next year of 2 per cent an exchange rate of 20 pesos to the dollar a 38 per cent rise in tax revenues inflation of 34 per cent and a 19 per cent increase in the budget for Pemex the state oil company that Mr Lpez Obrador wants to rescue Alberto Ramos at Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients that the underlying macro assumptions are on balance realistic and not very far from consensus But he said he was somewhat less comfortable with the projected 07 per cent of GDP decline in operational expenditure and the projected 03 per cent of GDP increase in nonoil tax revenue One economist who asked not to be named was far more downbeat I dont like it Its too optimistic on many frontsthey will have at least a one full point of GDP fiscal hole he said The main thing to watch in the coming months are the numbers right Were the calculations on the revenue side OK said Mr Berber Marco Oviedo head of Latin American economic research at Barclays called it a neutral budget with more moderate spending than had been expected He highlighted the fact that public investment which Mr Urza has repeatedly stressed needs to rise to drive growth was expected to be 29 per cent of GDP compared with 28 per cent approved in the 2018 budget Given the governments commitment not to raise taxes public investment is what had to give Mr Oviedo said It seems that as theyre just arriving they dont want to move things too muchthere will be gradual changes he added Mexicos new finance minister Carlos Urza said the government had applied stringent austerity and had reoriented spending towards welfare and infrastructure projects  Reuters Mr Cervera said some of the spending categories for pet projects such as a planned Maya tourist train in the Yucatn peninsula and a bursary and apprenticeship programme for young people appear to be too low because they are getting started The question is in future years how will they fund them Will they have enough money without increasing or introducing new taxes Mexicos growth has long been stuck in a rut of around 2 per cent But Mr Lpez Obrador has vowed to change that while dramatically shifting the oil industry towards higher production an end to oil exports and selfsufficiency in oil refining Mr Cervera however has only pencilled in growth of 12 per cent for Mexico next year He said the capital expenditure for Pemex was not a lot calling into question its ability to meet ambitious production targets of an increase of 600000 barrels per day by the end of the governments sixyear term They are taking out a kidney from their nogood older son inefficient expenditures It entails a reasonable amount of trauma The problem is they think they are using that kidney to put it into their younger favoured daughter better social spending but they are probably putting it into their dog bad projects Former Mexican official Im curious to see what the rating agencies make of the fact that 1 in 5 pesos of Pemex capex is for the new refinery he added It is a reasonable budget at the macro level if you think they can actually implement it It is not as prudent as they say they took out a lot of cushions If you have a few surprises it will be very hard to meet their goals said the former official He likened the plan to a reasonably competent surgeon attempting an operation that makes little sense They are taking out a kidney from their nogood older son inefficient expenditures that should be trimmed and made more efficient It entails a reasonable amount of trauma The problem is that they think they are using that kidney to put it into their younger favoured daughter better social and infrastructural spending but they are probably putting it into their dog bad projects and social spending without reform the former official added But the absence of nasty surprises meant markets were likely to give the budget the thumbsup The headline looks in line with what was promised and markets will be happy said Mr Cervera

subscription service.",http://fortune.com/2018/12/18/facebook-big-tech-data-privacy/,2018-12-18 21:51:12,Online advertising is the lifeblood of todays digital economy generating billions of dollars of revenue for adsupported businesses88 billion in 2017 aloneas companies try to capture and monopolize consumer attention With the currency being attention and data rather than dollars and cents this surveillance capitalism extracts a huge cost on individualsThis year has been riddled with a slew of data scandals that have consumers worried about the ways in which companies collect and store their personal data Not only do consumers want to trust the companies they share personal data with but they also want to feel confident that the company wont go selling their information to unknown thirdparties As a result there is an increasing demand for privacyfriendly business models where transactions are straightforward with the costs clearly communicatedThis increased demand for privacy parallels another market trend the rise of subscriptions In the past five years the subscription market has grown massively exploding from 57 million in revenue in 2011 to 26 billion in 2016 in ecommerce alone Netflix one of the socalled FANG stocks is Exhibit A that subscription businesses can earn massive revenueConsidering consumer demand for both privacy and subscription services its time for the top tech companies of the world to deliver on it Privacy in actionTo explore the potential of subscriptions built on the principle of consumer privacy lets consider an alternate universe where Facebook offered a paid productTo capitalize on this moment Facebook could offer a premium version of its platform that is completely ad and trackerfree and market it as the worlds first widely used privacyfriendly social network With an 8 to 10 monthly subscription Facebook Premium could help the company attract a privacyconscious audience that is increasingly less engaged with its platform and potentially generate the same amount of revenue as it does from advertising in the US and CanadaAs a paid product with no ads Facebook Premium would no longer have the impetus to monopolize user attention to maximize ad impressions nor would it need to harvest data to maximize conversion rates Instead it could deliver utility and value to its users as justification for the subscription cost To entice users to subscribe it could offer additional features for its messaging app premium content for video a curated and finite social experience that replaces its bottomless newsfeed and other product innovations that focus on useful and personalized features rather than user engagement While privacyfriendly subscription services could open new market opportunities for Facebook it isnt the only company that could benefit from this new model There are several tech giants that could benefit in similar waysFor example Google and Amazon already offer paid subscriptions Google which has more trackers across the web than any other company according to a study done by our researchers already charges users for increased storage on Google One Google could build on this subscription structure to offer private versions of Gmail Google Maps and other services for a nominal feeSimilarly Amazon already offers Prime its wildly successful subscription service with over 100 million members worldwide in 2018 Though Amazon is seeing impressive growth in digital advertising pulling in 4 billion in revenue last year its still dwarfed by the other ad giantsGoogle ranked in a whopping 95 billion and Facebook generated almost 40 billion Rather than fight that uphill battle Amazon could enhance its Prime membership with a new tier that grants users unprecedented privacy in ecommerce shoppingIn this way both companies could essentially put a price on privacy and let its users choose whether they want to pay for their technologies with moneyor with dataThe bigger picture data ownershipA critical foundation of privacyfriendly subscription services would be a data hub where users can seeand have an active role in choosingwhat data these companies have related to them More importantly if and when a user wants to they could completely delete edit or export their data In this way users privacy and control over their social and digital footprint could be turned into a product that is packaged and sold as a paid user experience Not only would this approach offer tremendous consumer value but it would also inoculate these businesses against aggressive privacy regulation like the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR In a world where big tech is facing harsh criticism this privacy as a paid service business model would pave the way for a mutually beneficial relationship between users and businesses Netflix and other subscription companies have already created the basis for a subscriptionbased future and now its up to the leading tech organizations of the world to put privacy at the forefront of their businessJeremy Tillman is the director of product at Ghostery

allies in the west were celebrating Christmas Shinzo Abes government said it is quitting the International Whaling Commission Japan will resume commercial whaling this year joining Norway and Iceland in defying the global norms designed to safeguard stocks of the extraordinary ocean mammalThe decision has provoked expected protests from the conservation groups and governments whose efforts during the second half of the 20th century halted what had seemed an inexorable hunt to extinction But in the era of US president Donald Trumps America First foreign policy of rising nationalisms of trade wars and of advancing authoritarianism Mr Abe doubtless hopes the water will soon close over his snub to one of the many multilateral organisations supporting the liberal international order Some in Tokyo think the move might actually reduce international controversy about Japans prowhaling stance After all its fleet has long exploited an IWC loophole to carry out research hunts in the Antarctic Now the boats will operate only in Japanese waters And who beyond a few conservationists will worry about a handful of Japanese fishing boats when the Russian navy is attacking Ukrainian vessels sailing in international watersAt a glance the Japanese prime minister may be on to something The fate of the IWC scarcely fits on the same seismic scale as that of the open global trading system Anyone who questions the stakes should recall that Mr Trump went to the UN last autumn to celebrate selfish nationalism and denounce globalism in all its guises You could look at Mr Abes decision through the other end of the telescope Japan has been among the most faithful supporters of the global order steadfast in its attachment to the international rule of law Tokyos new readiness to walk out of the IWC surely signals the system is now beyond repair Explaining the decision the governments chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said that it had become impossible within the commission to seek the coexistence of states with different views Other members of the IWC had refused to accept Tokyos position that the moratorium on whaling that has been in place since 1986 had seen numbers rise to a level sufficient to allow the safe resumption of commercial huntingIn its essence there is no difference in this exposition from the position adopted by Mr Trump on climate change Stripping out the hyperbole of his pronouncements the US president argues that Washington takes one view of global warming and members of the Paris climate agreement another So to Mr Trumps mind the US has made the reasonable decision to withdraw The US administration deploys much the same case when it threatens to leave the World Trade Organization or disavows the international agreement to monitor Irans nuclear programmeLike Mr Trump Mr Abe in effect is saying that he wants multilateralism  la carte Of course Japan is fully signed up to the rulesbased system except that is where a particular norm collides with its national preferences Surely it cannot have gone unnoticed in Tokyo that an increasingly assertive China adopts just this stance when it refuses to abide by international rulings on its territorial disputes with neighbours in the South China Sea Travel further along the road of pick and choose and the entire system soon collapses The rulesbased system works for everyone only if everyone accepts that the benefits overall outweigh the inconvenience of occasional clashes between international norms and national preferences The purpose of sharing notional sovereignty is to increase the real capacity to actGermanys Angela Merkel put it well in her New Year message National and international interests she said become indivisible in the face of global problems The chancellor singled out climate change international terrorism and unmanaged migration as vital areas of international cooperation She might well have added to this list preserving the ecosystems of our oceans The pity is that Ms Merkels present legacy is that of a leader who thus far has been more eloquent in the advocacy of such an approach than diligent in its applicationJapan has no need to resume commercial whaling Whale meat once an important source of protein long ago ceased to play any significant role in the nations diet The industry employs relatively few people concentrated in a small number of coastal villages But like Mr Trump Mr Abe is appealing to his electoral base The villages are concentrated in parliamentary districts mostly controlled by the ruling Liberal Democratic party Whaling is part of Japans nationalist folklore The prime minister has chosen to make it an emblem of national sovereigntyHe has done himself and Japan a disservice The most powerful nations will

2.25 to 2.50 percent.,https://content-service.bloomberg.com/articles/PK02DLSYF01V,2018-12-19 20:37:34,BloombergThe Federal Reserve raised borrowing costs for the fourth time this year looking through a stockmarket selloff and defying pressure from President Donald Trump while dialing back projections for interest rates and economic growth in 2019By trimming the number of rate hikes they foresee in 2019 to two from three policy makers signaled they may soon pause their monetary tightening campaign Officials had a median projection of one move in 2020Following the decision stocks erased gains and 10year Treasury yields fell while the dollar bounced off its lows of the day Investors may have been swayed by the Feds generally upbeat analysis and expectation of more rate increases than markets anticipateChairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues said economic activity has been rising at a strong rate in a statement Wednesday following a twoday meeting in Washington While officials said risks to their outlook are roughly balanced they flagged threats from a softening world economyThe Federal Open Market Committee will continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the economic outlook the statement said The unanimous 100 decision lifted the federal funds rate target to a range of 225 percent to 25 percentIn a press conference Powell cited both positives for the economy such as a strong labor market and wage gains while pointing to some developments that suggests growth is softening He said relatively benign inflation gives the Fed room to be patient in setting policyThe quarterpoint hike came after Trump assailed the Fed on Twitter for two straight days urging it to hold rates steady in the most public assault on its political independence in decades Investors are also fretting over the economy with the SampP 500 Index falling significantly in recent weeksAnswering questions from the media Powell said political considerations play no role in Fed policy making Were going to do our jobs the way weve always done them he said when asked about White House pressure The Fed will do its analysis and nothing will cause us to deviate from that he addedOfficials also altered key language in their statement saying the FOMC judges that some further gradual increases in rates will likely be needed a shift from previous language saying the FOMC expects that further gradual increases would be requiredIn addition the median estimate among policy makers for the socalled neutral rate in the long run fell to 275 percent from 3 percent in the previous forecasts from September The median projection is for the benchmark rate to end 2021 at 31 percent down from a prior estimate of 34 percentPossible PauseThose are more acknowledgments that rates are moving closer to the point where policy makers will at least take a break from the quarterly procession of hikes they pursued throughout 2018When taken together the latest quarterpoint move language changes and shift in rate projections indicate continued confidence in the economy yet also greater caution over how far and fast the Fed expects to move with future hikes As Powell has said the Fed is now feeling its way forward and will act in line with how the economy performsInvestors have had a more pessimistic view than the Fed foreseeing one increase at most in 2019 according to interest rate futures pricesIn a related move the Fed lifted the interest rate it pays on bank reserves deposited at the central bank by just 20 basis points instead of the usual 25 basis points that would match the quarterpoint increase for the fed funds target range As with a similar move in June the action was aimed at containing the effective fed funds rate inside the target rangePowell will have a chance to hone the central banks message to markets when he holds a press conference at 230 pmCareful BalanceHell be aiming to strike a careful balance expressing a still positive view on the US economy without telegraphing a policy outlook that investors might view as too aggressive for an economy that appears somewhat more fragile than just a few months agoWhile job creation has slowed slightly over the past several months it has still easily outstripped the number needed to accommodate population growth Unemployment in November remained at 37 percent its lowest since 1969 That has helped lift wages but hasnt provoked any serious signs of excessive inflationStill many forecasters expect growth to slow in 2019 and into 2020 and the Feds median estimate for gross domestic product expansion in 2019 fell to 23 percent from 25 percentPrevious hikes and a stronger dollar will gradually bite into the economy just as fiscal stimulus fades and foreign economies from China to Europe also cool Meanwhile the ongoing trade dispute with China and a potentially chaotic exit for the UK from the European Union represent significant additional

he is open to their suggestion that he meet directly with President Trump a sitdown that they hope will defuse Mr Trumps anger over interest rate increases that he blames for dramatic market swings a senior administration official said WednesdayOver the past week a battery of top White House aides have come forward to insist Mr Powells job is safe and that Mr Trump has no wish to oust or demote him even if he couldThe law is somewhat vague on the presidents power to fire the Fed chairman who is a member of the central banks board of governors A 1935 statute says the president can remove a governor for cause though the term isnt defined  Kevin Hassett chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers is the latest saying in an interview Wednesday that Mr Powell who goes by Jay is secure in his jobThe president has voiced policy differences with Jay Powell but Jay Powells job is 100 safe The president has no intention of firing Jay Powell Mr Hassett told The Wall Street JournalStill officials have made plain that the president watches the markets closely and was dismayed by sharp downturns that wiped out much of the gains recorded during his presidency He has singled out Mr Powell and has yet to directly offer the same fullthroated assurance of the Fed chiefs job status that his aides have suppliedOn Christmas Eve the president tweeted The only problem our economy has is the Fed They dont have a feel for the Market they dont understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders The Fed is like a powerful golfer who cant score because he has no touch  he cant putt Before Wednesdays rally the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the SampP 500 were on the brink of a bear market But indexes rebounded Wednesday with the Dow rising more than 1000 points for the first time in a single session In recent weeks White House officials broached with Mr Powell the idea of meeting privately with the president so that each can lay out his thinking about economic conditionsThey consulted past Fed chiefs including Alan Greenspan who served for nearly 20 years under four different presidents and came away satisfied that such meetings have happened in the past and wouldnt set a precedent or intrude on the Feds historic independenceStudents of the central bank see it differently contending that the Fed could lose credibility with the markets if it is seen as caving to pressure from Mr Trump who is preparing to run for reelection in 2020That could prove costly If inflation expectations rise bond yields are likely to go up too Bond yields and prices move inverselyMr Trump has told aides he is willing to meet with Mr Powell something they dont consider especially out of character White House officials noted that the president often meets with people who have been a target of his ire from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to Democratic House leader Nancy PelosiA meeting between the two should be helpful said Larry Kudlow the presidents top economic adviser Right now their relationship is like a stock looking for a bottom Theres only upsideOfficials noted that Mr Powell hasnt said he wants to see the president and talk things through Rather Mr Powells position seemed to be that if the president were to ask to see him he would be hardpressed to refuse one official saidNo meeting has been set though White House officials said they were hopeful it would take place early in the new year perhaps in JanuaryPresidents have met with Fed chairs over the course of the central banks 105year history said Peter ContiBrown a University of Pennsylvania professor who has written a history of Fed independenceHe cautioned that in this instance a facetoface meeting could backfireIts meeting in this way that I think is so dangerous Mr ContiBrown said Setting up this summit suggests the idea that there is some battle that needs a compromise some peace that needs to be struck And if you accept it on those terms then you see central bank policy monetary policy as reactive to the president and his electoral prospectsOther presidents have had fraught dealings with Fed chairs that direct dealings did little to resolveFormer President Lyndon Johnson once summoned Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin to his Texas ranch to berate him for raising interest rates saying it was despicable according to Mr Martins account ExPresident Richard Nixon privately pressured Fed Chairman Arthur Burns to keep rates low before the 1972 election according to Oval Office recordings Mr Burns kept rates low and

spent most of the last four decades diligently studying arcane rules and conventions in the shadows of Westminster PalaceThese days in the crucible of the UKs Brexit crisis the 63yearold expert in parliamentary procedure has found himself one of the hottest commodities in British politics Now the butcher baker and candlestick maker are suddenly interested in what I do he says Pundits lawmakers and investors scrambling for guidance on the UKs increasingly surreal divorce from the European Union are rushing to clerks like Mr Evans These donnish constitutional experts have found themselves yanked from dim libraries into political prime time pestered on weekends by government ministers and having to attend meetings to war game Brexit scenarios Many of these are before lunch which is a great inconvenience says Mr Evans The clerks have become coveted for their Jedilike knowledge of parliamentary protocol and a book called Erskine May an eponymously named tome written by a British parliamentary clerk and published in 1844 Theresa May the prime minister is not a descendant of Mr May the clerk The 1097page book provides the only written record of workings of the House of Commons which is almost entirely governed by conventions rather than lawsAccording to Erskine May and other parliamentary protocols lawmakers carrying swords must deposit them before entering the debating chamber to prevent them from impaling one anothers garments They can only procure snuff tobacco from a special box controlled by an official named the Serjeant at Arms They are barred from using certain language during debates including git guttersnipe swine and stool pigeon In a nod to medieval times Norman French is still used in some formal exchanges during a bills passageIn normal times the quaint procedural conventions of British parliament are of little interest even to lawmakersBut with Parliament struggling to agree on what type of Brexit the UK should pursue copies of Erskine May are being dusted off As tensions rise between lawmakers who want to quit the EU and those who want to stay in some are turning to sometimes obscure and ancient parliamentary rules to gain control of the Brexit process Only a handful of parliamentary clerksand even fewer lawmakershave actually read Erskine May but political analysts say it could prove central to unlocking a Brexitinduced legislative logjam that has bitterly divided parliament and the country Erskine May is going to count for more than Theresa May Philip Collins columnist at the Times of London and former speechwriter to Tony Blair wrote in a recent column In 2017 parliament voted to use a parliamentary procedure called a humble address to force Mrs Mays government to reveal documents outlining the potential impact of Brexit on the British economy The humble address was last used in the 19th century Lawmakers dug up old editions of Erskine May to justify its use Knowledge of obscure parliamentary protocols have kept clerks in demand In December clerks were consulted to deal with an incident where lip readers were called in to decipher whether the leader of the opposition Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn called Mrs May a stupid woman during a debate and thus contravened parliamentary etiquette Mr Corbyn insists he said stupid people No action was takenEarlier in December lawmaker Lloyd RussellMoyle tried to walk out of the debating chamber carrying a 5foot golden and pearlstudded ceremonial mace in protest of a delayed vote to approve a Brexit deal Without the mace which represents the queens authority the House cant meet He was escorted out by parliamentary officers called doorkeepers known for their attire of black longtailed coats white bow ties short pants tights and buckledown shoes It was a surreal week said Mr RussellMoyleThe spectacle of Westminsters Brexit debates has crossed the Atlantic A recent skit on Saturday Night Live featured a dancing Theresa May and her predecessor David Cameron portrayed by Matt Damon The Late Show with Stephen Colbert showed James Bond quitting his job after being asked to fix this Brexit thing Mr Bond then tells his boss that he will instead open a Quiznos franchiseWhen Erskine May wrote the book the British Empire was approaching its zenith under Queen Victoria and the UK Parliament was probably the most powerful democratic institution on earth Mr Evans said So it probably seemed like a good time to try and explain it he said There had recently been a huge overhaul of the UKs electoral system and the Palace of Westminster was destroyed by fire in 1834 The 19th century was a period of significant social and economic change in Britain that saw the expansion of Britains industrial power and growing calls to address the plight of the working class as chronicled by Charles Dickens It was also a period of frequent political crises including the refusal of the conservative Sir Robert Peel to form a government in 1839 because Queen Victorias ladies of the bedchamber or female attendants to the queen were supporting the opposition party the WhigsDespite starting his government service in a relatively humble position Mr May was ambitiousso he wanted to make his name and the book was a good way to do that and it worked Mr Evans addedThe surge of interest in parliamentary protocol has left some clerks overwhelmed I could do with a little less interest says Sir David Natzler the House of Commons chief clerk in his gothicstyle office with all 24 editions of Erskine May on a bookshelf and a portrait of the patricianlooking Erskine May on the wall To most people Erskine May is unreadable The book includes densely written examples of how parliament dealt with things in the past For example on page 666 it explains what to do if the queen signs off on a law by mistake For decades Erskine May officially called A treatise on the law privileges proceedings and usage of Parliament has been freely available to lawmakers With fewer than 100 days before the UK is set to leave the European Union companies on both sides are preparing for the possibility of a nodeal scenario which could leave goods stuck in ports in the UK and the EU Photo ReutersAt a mere 450 pages the first edition is the best read says Mr Natzler After that it just gets longer and longer He was proofreading the 25th edition over the holidays in between mealsThe public can read it too if they are willing to buy it for around 400 In a quest for transparency hackers made a copy available online a few years ago UK Google searches for Erskine May have spiked as the Brexit battleground shifted to parliament rising more than 10fold to a historic high in December In 2018 a freeerskinemay protest began on Twitter as Brexit tension boiled The government said the next edition will be made available free online Lawmakers were recently handed a simplified booklet explaining parliamentary procedure dubbed by one clerk as the childrens edition A blog post on the parliaments website titled Welcome to the Clerk side celebrated their newfound effort to clarify parliamentary procedureSome clerks are enjoying their moment in the sun There has been a surprising and delightful revivification of interest in Erskine May said Mr Evans flicking through a wellthumbed copy marked with dozens of yellow Postit Notes Im having fun Despite all the excitement other clerks are looking forward to quieter times When Mr Natzler retires later this year after over 40 years of service he wont be taking his edition of Erskine May with him Ive got other things that I want to do he saysWrite to Georgi Kantchev at georgikantchevwsjcom and Max Colchester at maxcolchesterwsjcom

a food truck on the Texas Gulf Coast last fall when an app on his tablet asked if he wanted to borrow 5000Its either one of those things that are too good to be true or its going to require a lot of time and effort where its not worth it for me Mr Wilson said Neither turned out to be the caseThe offer came from a unit of Square Inc which made the devices Mr Wilson uses to process customers card payments For weeks its algorithms had quietly observed Mr Wilsons sales and then decided he was creditworthy With a few swipes he accepted Squares terms and got the money within days He later borrowed more than 150000 to open a gastropub nearbySquare best known for its white creditcard readers that plug into smartphones is part of a wave of the tech giants making inroads into the banking business The firm run by Twitter Inc cofounder Jack Dorsey is already wellversed in financial services through its payments businessLast week the San Francisco company took another step towards banking It filed paperwork to open its own bank in Utah that would make loans to small businesses and offer deposit accounts to both companies and the general publicFew things terrify todays bank CEOs more than the specter of a big technology company elbowing them aside Squares new push puts it at the forefront of technology firms aiming to challenge banks not just on payments or digital apps but on the banks core business of making loans Tech firms vast troves of customer data can give them a builtin advantagePayPal Holdings Inchas extended more than 6 billion in smallbusiness loans since 2013 using data it collected by processing payments for Internet retailers Over the past seven years independent merchants that sell goods on Amazon have borrowed more than 3 billion from the ecommerce giant which approves loans based on sellers historical volumes Amazon reviews and other factorsOlder tech companies and financial firms have recently jumped into the fray Last yearIntuit Incstarted offering loans to businesses that use its Quickbooks software based in part on the data contained in their accounting statementsFirst Data Corpnow lets businesses that use payments devices from Clover a Square competitor that it owns take out loans based on their sales historyA team of techies at Square dreamed up its lending program now called Square Capital in 2013 when Square was around four years old Their cumulative work experience in the financial industry was little more than a single yearlong stint atGoldman Sachs Group IncCustomer feedback drove the idea Smallbusiness owners that used Squares payments services complained they couldnt get bank loans either because their personal credit scores were too low or their businesses didnt generate enough revenue Square Capital has since extended more than 35 billion in loans and cash advances to small businessesThe company is gearing up to expand into consumer lending next Under a new program individuals can now borrow up to 10000 to finance a purchase made at a participating Square business Executives are also exploring ways to provide personal loans or lines of credit to the more than seven million users of Cash App Squares digital moneytransfer service that rivals VenmoSquare is still a small player in the lending arena It extended about 200000 business loans in the 12 months ending Sept 30more than three times the number of loans banks provided through the entire Small Business Administration over the same period But the average size of its business loans is about 6500 much smaller than what banks typically offer The 405 million in credit Square Capital provided in the third quarter was about onequarter of the volume extended byJPMorgan Chaseamp Cos smallbusiness divisionFor Square there are plenty of factors that could curb its potential growth Square loans are funded by money managers and if they decide to stop purchasing the credits Square Capital would have to slow down its lending To keep those investors happy Square Capital also has to charge higher interest rates than banks which are funded by lowcost deposits And some customers just prefer to have a person  not an algorithm  as their bankerLike other financial technology firms Square is trying to achieve a delicate balance of offering banking services without triggering banklevel regulations Currently Square outsources to a small bank the more regulated parts of lending such as the ability to offer loans at uniform rates and terms nationwideThe bank that Square wants to open would be classified as an industrial loan company a niche type of financial institution that can offer banking services without oversight from the Federal Reserve This structure would give Square many of the privileges enjoyed by banks such as providing deposit accounts insured by the federal government while letting it stay in existing commercial ventures that regulated banks typically cant offerSquare has also hired more veterans of traditional financial institutions especiallyMorgan Stanleyto handle relationships with investors and manage funding Many welcomed the move from Wall Street to tech One Square executive who made the switch told colleagues it was like leaving a funeral and going to a weddingSquare Capital is now run by Jacqueline Reses a former Goldman Sachs dealmaker and privateequity executive who took over when the unit achieved a critical mass but she said the unit is still more focused on engineering expertise than traditional finance expertise Square makes automated decisions about riskiness by leveraging its data trove of businesses creditcard transactions Square also looks at more detailed information like whether a business is attracting repeat customers Youre not harassed and feeling like the bank man is going to come in any moment if you have a slow day Mr Wilson the food truck and gastropub owner said of the processThe company touts both the ease of getting a loan and paying it back Most customers never have to fill out a formal application and Square can deduct repayments from a companys daily takeTo offload risk Square sells the bulk of its loans to outside investment firms Current investors include Stone Ridge Asset Management LLC which runs a 35 billion fund devoted to alternative lending as well as the Canada Pension Plan Investment BoardSince its outset people both within Square and outside have been skeptical of the lending push Convincing David Viniar a board member and former top Goldman Sachs executive was a turning point people close to the company said At an investor event last year Mr Viniar described his initial reaction to Square Capital Im actually a much bigger fan of us getting other peoples money than of us giving them our money he said Sarah Friar Squares thenfinance chief and another Goldman alum helped sway him about Square Capitals competitive advantages In October a research analysts critical report about the consumer lending program helped send Squares stock down 9 in one day Squares increasing dependence on the extension of credit to its customers to spur its growth has made its business model increasingly vulnerable since its earnings would be more tied to the fickle appetite of the money managers wrote the analyst BTIGs Mark Palmer A Square spokesman said its consumercredit team is taking a diligent approach to riskSquares machinedriven approach to lending can also rankle borrowers with idiosyncratic circumstances who say they might be better served with a human touch Hardcore Sweets Bakery in Oakville Conn borrowed more than 130000 from Square Capital between 2014 and 2018 to buy more kitchen equipment and open a second location of its heavy metal themed cupcake shopCoowner Nicole Braddock said Square stopped making new loan offers to the bakery earlier this year but never explained why She said no one on Squares customerservice team would call her back and emails she sent to a corporate Square account

14:13:00,Many adjectives could be used to describe Shoshana Zuboffs latest book groundbreaking magisterial alarming alarmist preposterous One will do unmissableAs we grope around in the darkness trying to grasp the contours of our digital era The Age of Surveillance Capitalism shines a searing light on how this latest revolution is transforming our economy politics society and lives As the inventor of the concept of surveillance capitalism Zuboff fulfils a persuasive role in explaining the ways in which this voracious and utterly novel commercial project is radically rewriting the rules of the economic game creating extraordinary new asymmetries of knowledge and power By tracking our every click our every digital expression of interest ambition longing and desire the surveillance capitalists can climb inside our heads and sell those behavioural insights on to their real customers the advertisersAlthough Zuboff is a professor emerita at the Harvard Business School her account is as much polemical as it is academic She is determined to awaken our sense of astonishment and outrage about how this rogue capitalism has evolved to dominate and degrade our lives largely unnoticed and unchallenged She also makes one other more worrying and highly contentious claim that surveillance capitalism has created a new kind of unaccountable power instrumentarianism She defines this as the instrumentalisation of behaviour for the purposes of modification prediction monetisation and control that threatens to challenge some of the functions of the state and usurp the sovereignty of the people Instrumentarianism can determine the ends because it can manipulate the meansBecause this is an unprecedented development we fail to understand what is happening just as we failed to comprehend the rise of totalitarianism in 1920s Europe Moreover even if we sound the alarm we should not expect governments to arrest these pernicious developments because they are in many ways their complicit beneficiaries The security dictates of the post911 world meant that US administrations have given a largely free pass to the tech companies to develop surveillance capitalism while the Chinese leadership has jumped on it as a powerful means of entrenching controlThe main focus of Zuboffs analysis and the primary target of her attack is Google She argues that the search company invented and perfected surveillance capitalism in much the same way as General Motors invented and perfected managerial capitalism a century ago But other practitioners of surveillance capitalism come in for some vicious pummeling too most notably Facebook and MicrosoftIn Zuboffs view Googles original mission of making all the worlds information accessible mutated into a ruthless imperative to make money by exploiting and modifying human behaviour by serving up ads to users just at the moment they are the most susceptible to persuasion and generating wants they did not know they hadGoogle is now pursuing a land grab for all our data inventing new products to vacuum up every morsel on the digital map Every smart device from digital assistants to rectal thermometers selfdriving cars to connected homes has become a datagathering mechanism They all serve as oneway mirrors allowing the surveillance capitalists to spy on us without us ever seeing what is going on behind the glass There was a time when you searched Google but now Google searches you she writesSeven of Googles products and platforms engage 1bn active monthly users Gmail Android Chrome Maps Search YouTube and Google Play Store enabling the company to track ever more areas of a users life Similarly Facebook has more than 2bn users and is also expanding its interests into the physical world She compares the expansionism of the surveillance capitalists to that of the Spanish conquistadors who staked claims to virgin territories in the New World while suppressing the unsuspecting native AmericansYet there is a twosided nature to surveillance capitalism that makes it so dangerous in Zuboffs view concealing the dark reality behind the public illusion Googles users are not its customers which means it is radically indifferent to their real interests Advertisingsupported search engines will always prioritise those who pay the bills over those who use its services so long as they remain hookedThat also used to be the view of Sergey Brin and Larry Page Googles founders who presented a paper in 1998 highlighting the perils of advertising We expect that advertisingfunded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of consumers This type of bias is very difficult to detect but could still have a significant effect on the market they wroteThe expansionism of the surveillance capitalists is like that of the Spanish conquistadors who staked claims to virgin territories in the New WorldThat worldview changed when Google realised that the behavioural insights it could draw from its data were a potential gold mine offering far greater rewards than other advertisingdriven businesses such as commercial television Zuboff argues that the clearest logic of surveillance capitalism has been articulated by Hal Varian Googles chief economist who is sometimes referred to as the godfather of the companys advertising model As an expert in computermediated transactions Varian identified four features of this new economy data extraction and analysis new contractual forms due to better monetisation personalisation and customisation and continuous experimentation It was that formula that enabled Google to generate its vast wealth and has been copied by so many others sinceWhat makes surveillance capitalism particularly pervasive is the way it preys upon our behavioural vulnerabilities Indeed Zuboff argues that the ability to trade in our behaviour has created a new commodity fiction to use Karl Polanyis classification In this historians view the market economy only really took off when three mental inventions developed in the form of labour land and money turning abstract concepts into exchangeable commodities In a similar way Zuboff says the surveillance capitalists have been able to commoditise the fiction of behaviour turning our data into profit They no longer merely host content but aggressively secretly and unilaterally extract value from that contentWhere Zuboff strays into still more controversial ground is in her analysis of power Surveillance capitalists are not only able to monetise our data but can also use it to predict our behaviour and thereby modify it In mechanical terms they are no longer just sensors but actuatorsShe traces a straight line from the controversial behaviourist theories of BF Skinner the Harvard psychologist from the 1960s to those espoused today by Alex Pentland the MIT professor and author of Social Physics In their view she claims computational truth might prove a more effective way of running society than human governance The intent is to replace our political autonomy with heteronomy or the rule of others But who will determine the values of this Big OtherChinas vision is to use technology to monitor its citizens and assign them social credit scores used to reward or punish citizens for what the authorities deem to be socially good or bad behaviour Having destroyed trust by annihilating all social institutions the Communist party has seen technology as a means of recreating it artificially This is best understood as the apotheosis of instrumentarian power fed by public and private data sources and controlled by an authoritarian state In the west Zuboff argues that we are in danger of experiencing an antidemocratic coup des gens rather than a classic coup dtat an overthrow of the people rather than of the stateHer grand thesis can be contested on many levels She largely ignores the positive side of our technological revolution She almost certainly understates the competitive dynamics of the market And she portrays the young as helpless saps who use their phones 157 times a day even as they appear to be becoming ever more savvy about and sceptical of technologyZuboffs analysis of power is also debatable After all it is a strange kind of power that can be wiped off a phone in a matter of seconds Besides the people who theoretically wield power appear to have little interest in exercising it beyond enriching themselves and their shareholders They have no grand project for humanity other than vague notions of doing good The cardinal sin of the likes of Larry Page Mark Zuckerberg and Satya Nadella is surely not that they are evil but that they are naiveExtrapolation of current trends also leads to some extravagant conclusions The evidence for suggesting that surveillance capitalism may be increasing control over human actions is somewhat sketchy to say the least In the west at least the greater danger may be Facebookinspired anarchy rather than excessive control as protest movements like thegilets jaunes show in FranceThe weakest part of The Age of Surveillance Capitalism though concerns what she herself would do about the concerns she raises If the problems are so urgent then why are her proposed responses not more radical She suggests that 20thcentury conceptions of privacy laws and antitrust policies are outdated but sketches out few ways in which they could be updatedShe says the debate should revolve around three questions Who Knows who has access to knowledge Who Decides which institutions have authority And Who Decides Who Decides a question of power in deciding which institutions have authority Having raised so many stark questions her book tends to peter out in a series of mumbled answersBut her conclusions are surely right on at least two frontsFirst she attacks technologys ideology of inevitabilism even though that tends to undermine her case about its growing omniscience Just because technology has turned out the way it has does not mean that was the only way the internet could have evolved Its development was contingent on circumstance and influenced by individuals Societies can still choose to use technology in different ways so long as they can mobilise sufficient actionSecond we should be constantly wary of those offering sweeping technological solutions to human problems Such solutionist remedies are invariably worse than the original diseaseRobert Conquest the late conservative historian once argued that many of the greatest tragedies of the 20th century stemmed from solutions rather than problems Eliminating undesirable classes or races as in Stalins Soviet Union Hitlers Germany or Maos China were monstrously worse outcomes than any of the problems they were supposed to solveIt is always better to grapple with problems in imperfect messy human ways than to jump to allembracing inhuman solutions no matter how decisive or alluring they may seem to someThe Age of Surveillance Capitalism The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power by Shoshana Zuboff Profile Books RRP25 692 pagesJohn Thornhill is

tier below the standard economy level That includes no advance seat assignments inability to change or upgrade and lastgroup boarding so your carryon likely will be gatechecked Veteran travelers fear this change could easily lead to frequent fliers spending more miles for a regular economy ticketAnd as Delta American and United roll out premium economy on international routes changes are coming to upgrades Premium economy typically costs 500 to 1000 more than regular economy You get an extra inch of width more recline and legroom than standard economy and sometimes better food Still its a far cry from business class Right now you can upgrade a coach ticket to business class if you spend enough miles or have toptier status and an international upgrade certificate But on many airlines outside the US an upgrade goes up only one class of serviceeconomy to premium economy not business So youd need to buy a premiumeconomy seat to upgrade to business class Americans rules suggest its headed in that directionAirlines say they are adding options for travelers and improving their loyalty programs by giving you more ways to use your frequentflier miles To road warriors both moves make the seats they really want more expensive Economy and businessclass award ticket prices have gone up and your ability to upgrade from economy to business has gone down says Andrew Gold a Tampa Fla university professor Now they are complicating things further so your baseline instead of an economy fare is going to be basic economyAmerican Delta and United all reduced many travelers ability to earn miles when they switched to paying out miles based on fare rather than distance traveled about three years agoThe best perks of loyalty programs lie in toptier status where you get early boarding bagfee waivers better service and quicker rebooking If you are in the very top tier of a program you may get upgrades To many travelers the Delta test of basiceconomy awards is part of a patternreducing whats included with the lowest price and forcing people to pay more to get what used to come standard Basiceconomy fares started as tests in select markets originally pitched by airlines as a countermeasure to discount airlines then spread worldwide Since regular economy is about 60 roundtrip more expensive than the lowest price frequent travelers figure theyll soon have to pay more in miles for regular award tickets tooI have no doubt at all that this will become the standard Once you lose something they dont give it back to you says Lucian Chen a Delta platinumlevel frequent flier and a New Yorkbased attorney The systematic devaluing of miles is upsettingFrequent travelers shun basiceconomy tickets because of the restrictions and have little appetite for basiceconomy award tickets especially if they have lots of miles in their accounts But for frugal travelers those tickets can be an option to get an award when they otherwise might not have enough milesDelta says it is testing basiceconomy awards on a handful of routes between Minneapolis and Phoenix and routes out of Charleston SC Basic economy is often priced about 5000 miles or so less than standard Thats consistent with the cash price being about 50 or 60 higher for standard economy over basic economy If you dont care about a seat assignment in advance and are willing to live with the other restrictions a basiceconomy award ticket can save you some milesSince Delta no longer publishes an award chart the price in miles for trips varies significantly following the cash price Its hard to compare different markets since demand for seats changes rapidly But a spotcheck of flights roughly the same distance as trips from Charleston gives some credence to roadwarrior fearsA CharlestonLos Angeles roundtrip for Feb 8 to 15 priced out on Monday at 32000 miles for basic economy Delta requested fewer miles for standardeconomy trips to Los Angeles from Charlotte Columbia SC and Orlando Fla suggesting the basiceconomy price was no bargainDelta says since it ties its award price to the cash price of the ticket basiceconomy awards will be cheaper in miles than standard The price of a ticket isnt changing necessarily Delta spokeswoman Kate Modolo says The rollout of basiceconomy awards is not designed to impact maincabin pricing but instead to offer more reward optionsMs Modolo also says that by giving customers more ways to use miles we are making them more valuable not devaluing themWhile Delta says basiceconomy awards are something customers have asked for United says it has had no such requestsPremiumeconomy cabins havent yet degraded businessclass upgrades on US airlines But some of their international partners haveAmerican doesnt yet offer premiumeconomy upgrades and awardsa spokesman says the airline is working on it Americans upgrade rules already say that upgrades are valid to the next cabin of service Once premium economy becomes the next cabin of service an upgrade from an economy ticket may get you only premium economy not business classUnited started offering premiumeconomy awards on Dec 3 Michael Covey managing director of MileagePlus premier programs says early sales have been good for premiumeconomy awards on longer routes such as San FranciscoLondonBoth United and Delta have started premiumeconomy upgrades with flexible policies that allow toptier frequent fliers to use certificates to upgrade to business class or premium economy On United if a businessclass seat isnt available the upgrade certificate gets you a premiumeconomy seat and on a waitlist for a businessclass seatWe felt it was important to retain that benefit Mr Covey says I dont see at this time a future in which we put a system in where its only one cabin allowed Were really proud of the flexibility that we haveYou can also use miles or cash plus miles to buy an upgrade as long as youre not on the cheapest economy fares Business class costs more miles than premium economy but both are available on United and Delta On United if you buy a premiumeconomy ticket you get priority over people with economy tickets for businessclass upgradesMORE

reached a breaking point.",http://fortune.com/2018/12/31/living-with-no-heath-insurance/,2018-12-31 20:00:57,For many Americans 2018 was the year that health care reached a breaking pointInsurance was still too expensive to buy It didnt cover nearly enough And as the countrys politics festered the government once again failed to solve the insurance conundrum even as a large majority of Americans who flocked to voting booths said health care was their top concernMy colleagues and I spent much of this year talking to people who had weighed the health benefits against the financial burden of purchasing insurance Most decided to risk it betting that going without made more sense than paying for coverageWe started off following a dozen families people who were trying to work raise children and pay for a house or college When we invited others to share their stories about going uninsured an overwhelming number did more than 5000 Many sent us messages that could break your heart or raise your blood pressureIn Virginia the Jordan family shared their tale of sinking into bankruptcy because of unexpected medical expenses even though they had insuranceThe Maldonados in Texas were forced to choose which members of their family to keep on insurance policies as costs ratcheted ever higherOthers tried to find creative solutions like the patchwork of alternatives to traditional coverage that the Bergevin family in Boise Idaho assembled A nurse in South Carolina told us that she buys insurance every other year getting screenings and care in even years and rolling the dice in odd yearsOne theme that came up over and over again was that this is a problem reaching far higher into the economic spectrum than we first thought Many of the more than 100 people we interviewed over the year had incomes of 100000 or more These were comfortable families from outside Yet when they opened up their books to us it became clear how much they needed to stretch to afford health careThat often meant selfimposed healthcare rationing They didnt make these decisions lightly These werent uninsuredbychoice young invincibles They werent reckless or ignorant quite the opposite Many were educated professionals entrepreneurs and business owners They had bad options and were forced to make a choice about which family need had to be downgraded to a wantWe dont have enough money to go out to eat or take my grandchildren to the movies much less pay for health insuranceSome were more comfortable with the risks they were taking than othersKeith and Diana Buchanan of North Carolina gave up their expensive health insurance this year and bought a Bowflex exercise machine Keith said he got into the best shape of his life A lot of it is a result of knowing that were going to have to take care of our own health a little better he saidOthers werent so lucky In West Virginia Tara Sullivan didnt go to the doctor until her flu turned into pneumonia The drugs she needed cost 250 Among the more financially strapped of those we chronicled she was able to buy her meds only by skipping a payment on her gas bill The utility threatened to turn off her heat in the middle of winterWe dont have enough money to go out to eat or take my grandchildren to the movies much less pay for health insurance Sullivan told usWe also talked to people who couldnt afford to go without insurance some of the 133 million people with preexisting conditions who might have been shut out of insurance markets before the Affordable Care ActAndrea Preston in Bloomington Indiana lives with a rare autoimmune disease that causes her airway to collapse At 38 she needs repeated surgeries to keep it open she has already had seven and takes 15 medications Preston has insurance through her job as a technical writer but even then her medical bills accumulate faster than she can pay them Its a rolling ball I cant get ahead of she said in an email Its slowly steamrolling meIn Chicago Joe Della Croce a Vietnam veteran and twotime cancer survivor should be retired at the age of 79 Instead he holds down a lowwage job at a Home Depot to get insurance for his wife Rose 61 who has multiple sclerosis Shes too young to get on Medicare and cant afford medication without insuranceIt wasnt what he had planned to do in his later years Rose saidIts a rolling ball I cant get ahead of Its slowly steamrolling meIf 2018 was the year that health care fell apart 2019 isnt looking much better On a Friday night in midDecember a Texas judge ruled that the entire Affordable Care Act ought to be struck down For millions of people who have coverage whether they get to keep it may come down to yet another highstakes legal drama as the case works its way through the court systemAgainst that backdrop the Democrats will take over the House of Representatives in January with ideas of their own Some are pushing for an expanded role for government insurance such as Medicare for All Though such proposals arent likely to pass a divided Congress theyll lay the groundwork for debate as Democrats vie for their partys 2020 presidential nominationWith a political fix as elusive as ever large employers are signaling they are fed up with the current state of health insurance dysfunction A threeway effort between JPMorgan Chase amp Co Amazoncom Inc and Berkshire Hathaway Inc is attempting to increase quality and deal with rising costs Amazon and such other tech powers as Google parent Alphabet Inc have begun to delve into pharmacy and health records And a handful of startups are offering new ways to buy coverage and get careBut those sorts of fixes are years away if they ever happen For the people we spoke with that means more lastditch compromises to cobble together a plan or stay healthyIn Virginia the Jordans deductible still isnt affordable and their bankruptcy proceeding will likely stretch into 2020 In Texas the Maldonado family was able to buy coverage again for a collegeage daughter and her mother Maribel a cancer survivor But David the father is keeping himself off the policy for an additional year to save money Tara Sullivan will be eligible for health coverage at a new job in Florida starting in JanuaryBut at 200 a month Sullivan doesnt think she can afford it so shell remain in the ranks of Americans risking it for yet another year

is prompting a scramble for a littleknown metal in a oncethriving uraniummining belt in the US West and elsewhere in the worldThe deadly Sichuan quake that killed some 80000 people a decade ago led to new rules introduced by Beijing last month that aim to end the use of lowstrength steel in Chinas infrastructure and buildings Vanadium is a metal that even in small amounts can toughen steel and anticipation of the new Chinese rules sent vanadium prices soaring this yearThe demand boom has reinvigorated vanadium projects worldwide including the efforts ofEnergy Fuels Inc UUUU 179The Lakewood

since pulled back to 1950 it remains well above where it started the year at 825 a pound Two years ago it fetched less than 5Given the scale of 2018s gains the pullback is doing little to damp miners

implementation as such rules in China have at times been somewhat toothlessOnly a handful of vanadium mines are operating globally Most vanadium production comes from extraction by steelmakers when using vanadiumrich iron ore and they arent likely to produce more of the commodity just because prices are high Stricter environmental controls also make it difficult to ramp up output in ChinaWe have to face the restrictions and realities of getting new mines said Mark Smith Largos chief executive But he added The market needs new production in a big wayAbout 14 of vanadium comes directly from mines and can be found alongside more common commodities including iron ore uranium coal oil and aluminum ingredient bauxite It is relatively abundant with production ranging widely from the US and Australia to South Africa Russia and Brazil but vanadium isnt usually mined alone because prices have historically been too low to make it worthwhileStill the current boom has drawn many small mining outfits Several have bought land close to Energy Fuels Utah mill the only facility in the US able to process mined vanadium and they have reached out to the companys executivesIts hard to say whether we will have enough capacity to bring in other miners said Curtis Moore vice president of marketing and corporate development at Energy Fuels Certainly we are open to itThe company hired 35 people at its White Mesa Mill and La Sal Complex mines to help build its vanadium business and has held talks with potential vanadium buyers including US steelmakers Mr Moore saidBy revisiting the ponds at its mill Energy Fuels estimates it can produce up to 225000 pounds monthly over roughly the next year and a half Previously vanadium was sometimes discarded because prices were too lowAlso the miner is drilling again at nearby uranium mines to figure out how to target highgrade vanadium zones that were overlooked beforeReopening old mines because of high prices in a market thats small and typically volatile is a trickier decision One day people will pay you any price for your vanadium the next day you cant give it away Mr Moore saidWrite to Rhiannon Hoyle at rhiannonhoylewsjcom

conservative spending and careful investing support retirement at 45Solution Even with aggressive savings and low mortgage rate 60 is a more realistic goalIn Quebec a man well call Michel 34 works in financial services He earns 70000 a year and takes home 3640 per month after many deductions for taxes and benefits Frugal in his spending cautious in his investing he wants to retire at age 45 with 40000 income per year after tax Assuming a 3 per cent return rate after inflation that implies he will be able to add 1 million to present savings in 11 years On present income its unlikelyMichels goal is to quit his niche in the numbers business and travel the world The problem is how best to finance the years before he is eligible to receive benefits from the Quebec Pension Plan or Old Age Security In the case of the former it will be at least 26 years until he can access QPP albeit with a 36 per cent discount to the normal age 65 amount and 31 years until OAS kicks in at 65His plan is to fill the gap with outflows from his RRSP or TFSA accounts His strategy is to save very aggressively but his plan is based on not spending rather than on making a big score in investments That is conservative and reasonable indeed it is the best way to proceed But the question remains how to save as much and as fast as he reasonably canEmail andrewallentuckgmailcom for a free Family Finance analysisShould I accelerate my mortgage payments and once it is discharged invest in the stock market or should I make scheduled mortgage payments and invest what I can now he asks If I invest heavily and can attain a base for 40000 annual withdrawals can I bridge the time until 65 when I can draw on CPP and receive OAS Debt management and investment returnsThere are a lot of variables in this ambitious plan Michel asked Family Finance to run the numbers to test its feasibility and as well how to achieve his spending goal with the lowest tax cost along the way The problem of early retirement is twofold Not only must one build up savings faster but those savings have to last a longer time than they would with later retirementFamily Finance asked Caroline Nalbantoglu head of CNal Financial Inc in Montreal to work with Michel He is a disciplined saver and at 34 he has a condo with an estimated value of 165000 115030 in RRSP and TFSA accounts and just one debt  a 97000 mortgage with 24 years remaining amortization At present rates the mortgage will be paid when Michel is 58 For a relatively young person its a picture of a very solid financial base she saysAccelerated prepayment of the mortgage at the expense of investments is not necessarily a good idea His present interest rate 29 per cent has to be paid with aftertax dollars so in his bracket the real cost is about 34 per cent He can beat that with dividends from shares in chartered banks whose shares yield 35 per cent to 45 per cent plus or minus capital appreciationdepreciation or shares of utility stocks that have 4 per cent to 5 per cent dividend yields before share price changes Rising interest rates may tip the balance toward accelerated mortgage payments but Michel needs all the money he can save and invest for his goal of early retirement However if mortgage interest rates rise a couple of per cent then he can accelerate his mortgage payments the planner saysTiming retirementMichels goals will be hard to achieve even by 50 the planner says The earliest he can retire with a 40000 income after tax is 60 Assuming that he can achieve and maintain a 3 per cent annual return after inflation then in 26 years his RRSP with a present value of 90701 and 10800 annual contributions will have risen to a value of 612000 With the same assumptions his TFSA with a present value of 24329 and 6000 annual contributions including catchup additions to fill space will have risen to a value of 283800 His total capital available for retirement income will total 895800Assuming a 3 per cent return before tax his RRSP and TFSA capital at 60 would generate 40475 per year based on an annuitized payout that would exhaust all capital and income in the following 35 years to his age 95If he were to draw QPP of 64 per cent of a theoretical maximum benefit of 13600 in 2019 dollars per year at age 65 8704 his total income would be 49179 Retiring early makes attaining this maximum unlikely even with scheduled increases in CPPQPP contributions and benefits a planned 52 per cent boost to be phased in starting Jan 1 2019 After 20 per cent average tax he would have 39343 per year or 3280 per month At age 65 he could add Old Age Security benefits currently 7210 per year for total income of 56389 before tax Still using the 20 per cent rate he would have posttax income of 3760 per monthHis expenses with no mortgage payments nor savings would be about 2000 per month If we add 1000 per month for travel his expenses would be 3000 per month There would be 760 for other expenses such as a newer car or expanded clothing budget which currently stands at just 50 per monthThe end gameOur calculations show that even if Michel retires at age 60 26 years from now he would have to live very modestly Retiring at 60 and starting QPP benefits with a 36 per cent discount would have a drastic cost on his total lifetime benefit from CPP The amount he will give up each month compared to the full age 65 benefit about 5000 per year will have cost him 171500 with no compounding for the following 35 years It is a very high price to pay for what amounts to a five year bridge to full benefits at 65Partial retirement in Michels fifties would work as long as he can generate perhaps 20000 a year to supplement withdrawals from various accounts Raising savings rates is unlikely for Michel is already very frugal But retirement at 45 is not feasible with our income savings and investment assumptions the planner explainsRetirement stars 2  out of 5Financial PostEmail

born in Venice Its scaryDespite its worldwide popularity with tourists the city known as La Serenissimaor The Most Serenehas always been more than a theme park Once a maritime republic with an empire that stretched from the Alps to Cyprus Venice thrived well into the 20th century as a commercial port with a civic and cultural life beyond tourismRecent decades have seen the rise of package holidays cheaper travel increased mobility from China and Russiaand AirBnb The explosion of mass tourism and the growing cost and complexity of maintaining the architectural masterpiece have squeezed the space for residents to lead their livesOwning a home in Venice often brings the expensive obligation of taking care of a fragile piece of history Demand for holiday homes has pushed up prices and rents Business sectors apart from tourism have largely moved to the mainland Nearby towns such as Mestre or Treviso offer more housing with modern conveniencesOnly six fish stalls now survive at the Rialto market from 18 around 15 years agoThe markets problems mirror those of the city said Irina Freguia the 70yearold owner of local restaurant Vecio Fritolin who has bought fish here all her life None of

without its people is like a man without blood Some 20 years ago buyers were waiting for us to open early in the morning said Dario Naccari 55 who runs a Rialto stall Now eight out of 10 people who stop at the stalls are tourists They take photos and leave he saidA residents association has organized events to raise awareness of the threat to the market They are also collecting signatures to petition the local authority to create a museum dedicated to the market which they hope would attract foot traffic that could be converted into businessIve always come here for my shopping It was full once but less and less so now said Luisa Dal Pozzo a 62yearold teacher The vanishing customers are partly the fault of Venetians who prefer to rent their properties to tourists rather than locals so they can make more money she saidA family of holidaymakers would go to a pizzeria but certainly wouldnt come here to buy the fish said fishmonger Ruggero DIseppi 57 during one of the many idle hours

Chinese units,https://www.ft.com/content/0a198efa-fa3c-11e8-af46-2022a0b02a6c,2019-01-02 11:35:24,Western insurance bosses like to talk up the vast potential for growth in China Prudentials head of Asia says China will be its fastestgrowing marketfor many years to come The chief executive of Allianz hails it as a strategic marketGiven the sheer size of Chinas population and the relatively low proportion of people who have insurance this excitement is understandable For instance only 114m Chinese people have life insurance out of a population of 14bnNow foreign insurers are gearing up for a major push in China hoping to use the longawaited easing of foreign ownership rules as a springboard But the big international groups have struggled to make their presence felt against the domestic giants Despite operating in China for decades their combined market share is under 5 per cent Experts have warned that the countrys vast armies of insurance agents and tight local regulation are likely to hold back the advance by global businessesSince joining the World Trade Organization in 2003 China has been under pressure to open its financial services industry to foreign players Changes have come slowly and Beijing has been accused of dangling the prospect of greater control in front of some of the worlds largest banks and insurers while simultaneously shirking real reformsForeign insurers were among the first international financial groups allowed in the country starting in the mid1990s when Manulife launched a joint venture with chemicals group Sinochem Most foreign insurers have been allowed 50 per cent ownership but other significant reforms have largely stalledIn what was considered a breakthrough this year top leaders laid out timetables and conditions for allowing foreign securities asset management banking and insurance companies to lift their stakes in joint ventures and in some cases take full controlOverseas insurers have taken notice Frances Axa has bought the 50 per cent of Chinese joint venture Axa Tianping that it did not already own in a deal that was flagged as an industry first in China Germanys Allianz meanwhile has won approval to set up a wholly owned holding company in the countryThe changes came several years ahead of a timeline that was set out in April a sign China is under pressure to show real changes in how it treats foreign financial groupsThe Chinese leadership has held back for a long time and has now decided to open Oliver Bte the Allianz chief executive said at a recent investor dayOther foreign groups have expressed interest in raising their stakes Philippe Donnet chief executive of Generali said in a recent interview with the Financial Times Wed like to have a bigger share of our joint venture in China but it has to be legally possible and wed need the full agreement of our partnerUKbased Prudential also would like to increase its stakes in its two Chinese joint ventures to above 50 per cent viewing China as one of the big drivers of its growth in Asia In September it signed a deal with the government to help develop the countrys pension system The Chinese insurance market has long been held up as one of huge potential both due to the limited spread of insurance products and the rapidly growing demand for new financial services from the rising middle classInsurance density or premium per capita was only 345 in 2016 and penetration a measure of insurance premiums as a proportion of GDP was 42 per cent in 2016 according to a report in 2018 from the consultants PwC That is about half the level of penetration in the USStill between 2013 and 2017 life insurance premiums in China grew by a compound annual growth rate of about 23 per cent hitting 330bn in 2017 While coming from a low base health insurance premiums have grown more than 40 per cent each year to 68bn in 2017By taking full ownership of their China units foreign companies will be homing in on that growth But analysts and advisers say that is easier said than doneChinese insurers now have the worlds largest base of agents a force that will push back against encroachments from new entrants into the market China Life for example has about 2m agents Ping An touts more than 1mI doubt well see a massive share gain the Chinese companies have sharpened their pencils a bit said Linda SunMattison an analyst at Bernstein To grow you need distribution you need arms and legs on the ground It is hard to get the agents though and it takes time to train themShe added The increase of the cap for foreign ownership could help foreign insurers if they are willing to investWe dont want to be the biggest in China but we want to go after the segments where it makes sense for usGordon Watson chief executive of Axas Asian businessExecutives have argued that the strategy for foreign companies is not to wage an allout war with the domestic competition Instead they will need to target specific areas of strength The area we are really interested in is on the health side said Gordon Watson chief executive of Axas Asian business We think health innovation will really change the market We are the largest health insurer outside the US so we have the expertiseWe dont want to be the biggest in China but we want to go after the segments where it makes sense for usAllowing foreign companies to own 100 per cent will not remove many of the other regulatory hurdles they face namely approval to expand across different provinces Provincial insurance regulators must grant companies permission before they can expand Hong Kongbased AIA has held 100 per cent of its business in the country for several decades an anomaly attributed to its early roots in China nearly a century ago Nevertheless AIA can operate only in two provinces and four cities The government has other levellers to pull by approving businesses province by province sad Sam Radwan principal at Enhance International a consultancy that advises Chinese

19:20:00,WASHINGTONTurkey is asking the US to provide substantial military support including air strikes transport and logistics so that Turkish forces can assume the main responsibility for fighting the Islamic State extremist group in Syria senior US officials sayThe Turkish requests are so extensive that if fully met the American military might be deepening its involvement in Syria instead of reducing it before leaving the officials addedDiscussions on how the Turks might take over the Syria mission will take place in talks in the Turkish capital Ankara on Tuesday involving White House National Security Adviser John Bolton Gen Joseph Dunford the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and James Jeffrey the State Department envoy for SyriaPresident Trump said last month that he had reached an agreement with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the Turkish military to replace the more than 2000 US troops in Syria within weeks Mr Trump later indicated he was slowing the American troop withdrawal following widespread criticism over the risks to the abruptly announced planThe plan for US troops in Syria to be replaced by Turkish forces which remains on track was codified in a classified memo Mr Bolton recently sent to cabinetlevel officials US officials saidMr Bolton also wrote in the memo that the administrations prior policy objectives in Syria were not being changedThose goals have included defeating Islamic State evicting Iraniancommanded forces and pursuing a diplomatic end to the civil warProponents of Mr Trumps decision to hand over to Turkey assert that this shows the administrations basic strategy is intactBut skeptics within the government say there is a wide gap between the White Houses goals and the means that will be available to carry it outMr Trump embraced Mr Erdogans offer to take on the mission against Islamic State in a Dec 14 phone call in a decision that surprised both former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Brett McGurk the US envoy to the coalition fighting Islamic State people familiar with their thinking said Both subsequently resigned their postsThree US military officials said there was a widespread view that the Turks couldnt replicate the role that the American military has played in Syria against Islamic State noting that the Turks faced an array of logistical and political challenges That assessment also is shared by a number of intelligence analysts a US official saidI havent heard anyone say they think the Turks can do it one of the military officials saidPresident Trump ordered the withdraw of US troops from Syria and declared that America had defeated ISIS WSJs Gerald F Seib discusses the significance of the decision and its consequences Photo APThe officials said they didnt believe the Turks could logistically move their forces deep into Syrias Middle Euphrates River Valley to battle Islamic States remnants and provide the supplies they needed The officials also questioned Turkeys ability to carry out a substantial air campaign against the terror group which has been a key part of the USled coalition campaignThere also are widespread fears that the Turks will target the Kurds a longtime ontheground partner for the US in the antiIslamic State campaignTo try to mitigate these risks Mr Jeffrey the State Department envoy is seeking to work out an arrangement with the Turks that would allow them to go into northern Syria while avoiding largely Kurdish areas according to US officials familiar with the plansMr Jeffrey has also asked Gen Mazloum Abdi the Kurdish commander of Syrian fighters with whom the US has been working to hold off on making any deals with President Bashar alAssads government while the Trump administration tries to develop its strategyMr Jeffrey will take over Mr McGurks responsibilities as the top US representative to the coalition fighting Islamic State while retaining his duties as the senior envoy on Syria policy several US officials saidOne US official said that administration was unlikely to provide all of the military support including air cover that the Turks are seeking We are certainly not planning to support them at that level of air support a US official said Emre Ozkan a counselor at the Turkish embassy in Washington said he had no information to offer on military planning by his government and the US A spokesman for Gen Dunford said We have nothing to provideDespite President Trumps assertion on Dec 19 that the USled coalition had defeated Islamic State strikes against the terror group have since increased From Dec 1629 there were 469 coalition strikes against the group in Syria according to the coalition Among the targets were command and control nodes explosive facilities weapons caches and one unarmed aircraft system the US military said in a statement Between Dec 915 the coalition said it conducted 208 strikes in SyriaThe US also is considering moving ships toward the region in case troops come under attack while leaving the country Withdrawing from a war zone is a particularly vulnerable time for troops as they move large amounts of people and equipment out of the country An amphibious assault ship for example carries helicopters aircraft and hundreds of troops and could mitigate that risk a defense official saidMr Erdogan offered to take on the fight against Islamic State during the Obama administration but US officials believed then that Turkey was promising more they could deliver and noted that the Turks were assuming they would also have support from the US militaryPentagon officials were very skeptical of the Turks ability to deliver on the ground in the fight against Islamic State a former Obama administration official saidVivian Salama in Washington

capitalists and limited partners to come talk techInvestors from Andreessen Horowitz Greylock Partners Khosla Ventures and Battery Ventures attended the twoday roadshow in Paris that took place at Station F the Vision Institute iBionext and the Elyse PalaceChelsea Stoner a general partner at Battery Ventures was part of the group that went on the tourThey organized this trip to show how forwardthinking the Macron administration is she told Term Sheet Its clear they want to turn France into more of an innovation capital Its far easier to do business there than some of us thoughtStoner is a growth investor who has risen through the ranks at Battery to become the first and only female partner in the firms 35yearhistory She often pursues softwarehealthcare companies in markets that a lot of other investors overlook Her portfolio includes Avalara which raised 180 million in an IPO earlier this year and Brightree Marketo ClearCare and Curve DentalIn a wideranging conversation I caught up with Stoner to get her impression of the French tech ecosystem as well as to learn more about some of her biggest deals and gain insight into her investment strategy Read the full QampA hereTERM SHEET What was the general feeling among the VCs on the tour about investing more capital in European tech companiesSTONER There have been good companies to come out of France Germany and the UK but being able to cross a border and become a large compelling company across Europe is difficult to do A lot of companies tend to be pretty conservative they get to the 50 million level and sell rather than wait for the really big outcome Valley investors on the other hand are willing to take a lot of risk Are we going to take the time to go over there if we think the founders are willing to sell early I dont know thats not really that interesting to us So thats still a big question The sense in France though is that they recognize this so they talked to us a lot about the changing attitudes around risktakingYou went on the trip during the yellow vest protests in Paris What are some of the risks associated with deploying capital in the region STONER Its hard to say Macron and his team have made it much more compelling to do business in France both for entrepreneurs starting a business as well as for investors doing deals The protests and unrest happening there obviously present a big cloud over this I think Macron has this very strong message and I think hes doing everything he should be doing to make it right Europe needs a leader in technology right now and it would be a real shame if he doesnt execute on his plans But right now is a tough time to be in his role for sureYou backed Brightree which was acquired for 800 million At the time the CEO said that Battery helped boost revenues from 8 million to over 100 million What are some things you did to transform the company into an attractive acquisition target STONER First and foremost our management teams operate the businesses and we do everything we can to be helpful Were not giving them playbooks and telling them what to do but we are very helpful when it comes to acquisitions The case with Brightree was that they had never done an acquisition before Once you have the market map of all the companies in and around that space you ask yourself Are there certain technologies to go acquire and sell to your customersThey were seeing pretty dramatic organic growth just from selling their core cloud product to businesses that really needed a cloud product That was tremendous growth Then we ended up doing 6 acquisitions onto the platform and we took something that they were selling for 5000 a year up to at the end 50000 a year You get a customer whos paying so much more because youve unlocked all the value you can offer them through different packagesAnd then it really comes down to the execution of the acquisition We do deals for a living so we should be able to be on the ground helping them execute acquisitions In Brightrees example I was helping them develop relationships with the acquisition targets create models and negotiate the docsWhats going on in the cloud space right now that you think Term Sheet readers should know aboutSTONER The biggest story continues to be the shift to the cloud from the legacy space We think its still in the second or third inning and theres still so much older software out there and new cloud companies coming up all the time What gets me so excited is how that applies to various verticals People can now develop software much more cheaply and be able to go after smaller markets so it makes sense nowLook at the dentist space for example We just invested in Curve Dental which is based up in Calgary Something like 5 of dentists use cloud software today thats pretty incredible So there are still these pockets of different markets out there that could really benefit from the adoption of cloudCompanies have access to a lot more capital these days As a growth investor how do you see the venture capital landscape evolving as players like SoftBank enter the market STONER Its a very interesting strategy I tend to like that SoftBank is going after the category leaders just like we are They know who those are by the time that theyre investing and putting a ton of money behind them Theyre making very big bets obviously in each of the leaders in the respective markets and its a very good strategy Does it make our jobs tougher as growth investors Yeah It just means we need to be there before SoftBank is We need to find

to collapse",https://www.ft.com/content/9bca6354-01e6-11e9-99df-6183d3002ee1,2018-12-17 16:47:47,FT subscribers can click here to receive FT Free Trade every day by email Hello and thanks for reading FT Free Trade in this momentous year for international trade We will be taking a twoweek pause for the holidays but will be returning on January 7 ready and keen for 2019 If you have any big predictions please send them my way at jamespolitiftcom Will Donald Trump and Xi Jinping sign that deal Will the US impose car tariffs Will the World Trade Organization be reformed in time for the dispute settlement system to survive Will the USMexicoCanada agreement to replace Nafta pass Congress Its all fair game Happy holidays to all James Rescuing the Argentine handshake In the immediate aftermath of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires it was far from clear whether the trade truce between the US and China would even last until Christmas Not only were there doubts about the commitments made during the dinner between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping but markets were tanking and Meng Wanzhou chief financial officer of Huawei was arrested in Canada following an extradition request from the US a huge slap in the face for Beijing But then on both sides of the Pacific something of a rescue mission appears to have been launched to prevent the ceasefire from collapsing in its earliest days China began taking some of the initial steps it had promised on the margins of the G20 It cut car tariffs back to their levels before the trade war it began buying US soyabeans again and officials have indicated they are ready to change the countrys industrial policy Meanwhile China did not direct any particular ire towards the US for Ms Mengs arrest instead it focused on punishing Canada a softer target by detaining two of its citizens on its soil avoiding so far a headon collision with the US over the Huawei case The US for its part has insisted there was no relationship between the Huawei case a law enforcement matter and the trade talks China wants to make a big and very comprehensive deal It could happen and rather soon Mr Trump sounding optimistic said on Twitter on Friday To be sure time has been wasted Liu He the Chinese vicepremier was supposed to lead a delegation of negotiators to Washington last week for talks with Robert Lighthizer the US trade representative but those have been delayed until next month The holiday break in the US and Chinas new year celebrations will slow down the negotiations significantly And there are still fierce divisions inside both governments about how much to concede in the talks But the presidents dinner in Buenos Aires was not just a bluffing exercise One tangible sign of the mutual desire to reach an agreement was that Mr Liu Mr Lighthizer and Steven Mnuchin US Treasury secretary held a call last week to discuss the next steps Another is that the public disagreements over trade strategy within the Trump administration have died down as it tries to project a united front in Washington while negotiating with the Chinese However investors appear wary After a shortlived rebound US equities continued to sell off at the end of last week with the SampP 500 falling to its lowest level since April The USChina truce may be real but it will be a hard slog to achieve by early March any kind of agreement tackling all the main problems such as intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer Any further US steps to tighten the screws on Huawei and meaningfully undermine its business model could throw things off course More geopolitical tensions in the South China Sea for instance could embolden military hawks in both capitals putting pressure on both leaders to resist a trade deal Whether or not Mr Trump and Mr Xi can capitalise on their Argentine compromise is still very much a tossup Life goes on in Brussels and Tokyo Just because the Trump administration has halted the onward march of trade liberalisation it does not mean the rest of the world has followed Washington and put everything on ice The EU and Japan received a boost last week when the EU parliament ratified their free trade agreement creating an open trade zone that will cover more than 630m people The deal is labelled the carsforcheese agreement Japan is opening up its agricultural market to European wines and cheeses while the EU is allowing greater access for Japanese carmakers Implementation will boost many EU and Japanese companies while the US is still lacking any sort of trade agreement with Brussels and Tokyo that would benefit its businesses For Washington it will be a test of the costs involved in Mr Trumps retreat from the TransPacific Partnership which includes Japan and the transatlantic trade and investment partnership a budding deal with the EU that was abandoned by the US president Number of the week 1bn Japan will scrap that amount of duties on European exports as a result of the trade deal with Brussels Chart of the week The intersection of climate and trade will be one of next years greatest themes For instance we already know that French president Emmanuel Macron has warned that he will not allow his country to enter a free trade agreement with a nation that has not met the Paris goals on lowering emissions So lets start with the great graphical work by my FT colleagues on

River.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-true-state-solution-11546473263,2019-01-02 23:54:24,The Trump administration has offered tantalizing clues about its forthcoming Deal of the Century for Mideast peace It could be a bold new conceptreplacing the failed twostate solution with a JordanIsrael confederacy in which Jordan would be recognized as the Palestinian state Call it the truestate solutionPalestinians have always been the majority in Jordan though they havent been treated as such since its creation as a Britishappointed Hashemite monarchy in 1921 The truestate solution would enfranchise the Palestinians Jordan would extend citizenship to and assume administrative responsibility for Arabs now living on the West Bank of the Jordan Riverincluding the cities of Jenin Nablus Ramallah Bethlehem and Jerichowhich would be Israeli territory West Bank Jordanians could receive financial support to relocate across the river to Jordan itself if they wish or remain as permanent residents but not citizens of Israel Israelis would be free to live anywhere west of the Jordan River Variations of this Jordan option have received increasing attention across the region in recent years Why would King Abdullah II accept such an arrangement To be blunt it would be his best option His ruleand his familys security and fortunealready teeters under pressure of regional migration and domestic Palestinian discontent The kings acquiescenceor possibly USguided abdicationwould probably buy his familys protection Trump administration officials have promised their plan will take advantage of Israels recent unprecedented collaboration with its Arab neighbors and other developments that suggest things can be done today that were previously unthinkable as thenAmbassador Nikki Haley said last month The administration promises a new approach based on practical realitiesStart with a truthful foundation of history Britain inherited all of presentday Jordan and Israel when the Ottoman Empire dissolved after World War I The Palestinian Mandate of 1922 divided the area into Arab Palestine Transjordan comprising 78 of the territory and Jewish Palestine Israel the remaining 22 Britain later tried to accommodate Arab opposition by further dividing Israels 22 in what became the United Nations Partition Plan of 1947 The Jewish Agency for Palestine immediately accepted that plan But when the General Assembly passed the resolution recognizing Israels independence the Arab states immediately launched a war which squandered the Partition Plans window for an Arab state on the West BankJordan encouraged by Britain annexed the West Bank in 1950a move the Arab League bitterly opposed and almost no state recognized That arguably left Israel with the legal right under the original British Mandate to claim sovereignty over the entire 22 of Palestine outside modern Jordan Israels claim was further consolidated by its victory in the 1967 war Jordan later disavowed its claim on the West Bank and severed administrative ties in 1988 leaving the status of its former citizens further in limboYasser Arafats Palestine Liberation Organization had tried to win Palestinian control of Jordan repeatedly attempting to assassinate King Hussein in the 1960s After the PLO was evicted to Syria by Jordanian troops in Black September 1970 the PLOs narrative shifted entirely to painting Israel as the Palestinians occupier Despite underwriting a twostate settlement in the 1993 Oslo Accords Arafats launching of the second intifada seven years later revealed that the PLOs paramount goal was still rejection and delegitimation of Israel not coexistenceWest Bank Palestinians have been fortunate to remain in territory under Israeli protection and administration since the 1967 war They have been unwanted by the Hashemite Kingdom or other Arab nationsthen and since Little wonder that polls suggest a large majority of West Bank Palestinians would prefer life in Israel to being governed by the Palestinian Authority They seek normal lives jobs they can travel to and other basic human liberties This would be possible with a Palestinian role in Jordans leadership that not only accepts the Jewish states legitimacy and mutual security responsibilities with Israel as the Hashemite Kingdom already does but also restores the Palestinians Jordanian citizenship and coordinates with Israel in civilly administering the West BankThere are Palestinians who would support such a move Mudar Zahran 45 is a Jordanian Palestinian who describes himself leader of the Jordanian Opposition Coalition He lives in Britain under asylum having been convicted in 2014 in absentia for inciting hatred against the regime sectarian strife and insulting the king as well as security services to show for it Mr Zahran told the European Parliament in September that what holds back the Palestinian people from enjoying Israels economic prosperity is the corruption of the Palestinian Authority and the Hashemite familys exploitation of Jordans Palestinian majority Let our people go he implored both peoples Jordanians and Israelis A truestate solution would let them end the futile refrain of resisting and defending and get on pursuing common interests as they have been for decades in Jerusalems Old City A Palestinian capital in Amman would have no use for the Palestinian Authority much less its corrupt illegitimate and unpopular leaders and their incitement Would King Abdullah make room for morerepresentative governance in Jordan Or might some forwardlooking Palestinian emerge with US Israeli and Arab support to advance his citizens economic prospects and human rightsAnd what about Gaza US officials have said they see that as a separate problem and its resolution as a prerequisite for success It seems logical that Palestinians there could also enjoy a confederacy option with either Jordan or EgyptThe truestate solution would be innovative and elegantworthy of Deal of the Century designation If it materializes Barack Obama will ironically deserve some of the credit His cultivation of Irans Ayatollahs stimulated the Arab

few bookstores The last book the mother and daughter read together was Gabriel Garca Mrquezs Chronicle of a Death ForetoldWhen her daughter went missing in 2011 Ms Victoria said she went straight to the police Jaime Ramrez a commander in the investigative police was put in charge of the probe Frantic Ms Victoria went to the police station daily for updates She got the impression no one was working the case After the fourth day she decided to camp out at the stationCommander Ramrez urged her to go home she said saying he would take care of the case Ms Victoria refused So he placed a call on his cellphone and handed her the phone On the other end of the line was a bruja a witch from the detectives hometown of Xaltianguis The bruja told Ms Victoria she had seen her daughters picture and concluded she had been abducted by a boy who was angry she wasnt his girlfriend but that she would return home safelyThis witch was their investigation Ms Victoria saidIn response to inquiries Acapulcos police said they couldnt comment on the caseMs Victoria went to the local marines barracks asking for help They told her they couldnt intervene She went to the local army base There a sympathetic officer told her they could sell her a gun and give her target practice so she could defend herselfShe called the federal attorney generals office and they gave her the number of Commander Ramrezs boss in the state capital He assured her he would send someone else to help on the case The next day when she returned to the station she was asked to give a second full statement on the kidnapping The following week a day after the family paid about 1500 in ransom her daughters body was found Months and sometimes years have gone by since the arrests with no news from the various courts handling the cases It took 1 years for police forensics to analyze the content of the gang members mobile phones which contained videos of hostages being beaten The videos had been sent to parents to encourage ransom payments It took five years for a laptop found at the safe house to be analyzedThe case files reviewed by The Wall Street Journal are a window into the legal system Names and surnames of suspects and witnesses are misspelled repeatedly as are names of local places brands and storesDates and file numbers contradict one another Statements change abruptly from first to third person There are five different versions about how much money the alleged gang members made with every kidnapping Police misstepsTorture or beatings to extract confessions is a common practice among Mexican police who often lack training for detective work A defense attorney for one of the alleged gang members Jos Abaunza says his client was tortured by police to extract a confession and is innocent A state appointed psychologist said Mr Abaunza bore the psychological scars of mistreatment Marco Antonio Ordorica one of a handful of local judges overseeing the case said he couldnt comment on the allegations but added If I let out everyone who claimed they were mistreated by police the jails would be emptyFamily members of victims often do their own detective work The mother of Mr Ros found two witnesses who were eating pizza with her son the day he was kidnapped They told her Leslie repeatedly called asking him for help moving furniture The witnesses said Leslie eventually persuaded him to help herThe mother asked them to testify One refused saying she was too scared the mother said The other agreed but when told by the family members lawyer that he would have to face the alleged gang members in court he said no Both witnesses have since fled AcapulcoThe victims families are relying on governmentappointed lawyers to help them navigate the judicial system Milixa Sorroza who is helping Ms Victoria and some of the other families is a lawyer from a federal government committee to help victims of violenceMs Victoria says Ms Sorroza has neglected to tell her about crucial developments including scheduled hearings On another occasion in 2013 Ms Sorroza invited all the family members to Acapulco for what was supposed to be a sentencing in the case It turned out the courts were closed for a public holidayIn 2014 several parents sent a formal complaint to the national victims commission about Ms Sorroza They got a formal response from the National Human Rights Committee three years later saying the agency found no wrongdoingMs Sorroza declined repeated requests for an interviewSome of the alleged gang members have been able to pay for private lawyers The police havent confiscated any assets or earnings from the alleged kidnappings Jos de Jess Glvez who was cleared of charges and released in 2016 was represented by one of Acapulcos top lawyers Francisco Espinoza Grado starting in early 2013 In mid2014 Mr Espinoza stepped down from the case after being named a minister to the states top judicial oversight body but appointed his nephew to continue the case The nephew won the acquittal while the uncle was on the judicial oversight body The federal victims commission is appealing the decision to release Mr Glvez Mr Glvez has said he is innocent Mr Espinoza and his nephew declined requests for comment OverloadedMs Victoria recently visited the public prosecutor handling her daughters case Eduardo Zamora Mr Zamora told Ms Victoria he didnt have any news about the case but hoped there might be a hearing in the next six monthsHe declined to discuss details of the case with a visiting reporter citing Mexican law He did talk about an overloaded and underfunded judicial system As he walked around his offices he sidestepped stacks of case files some a foot thickSome of these cases are 15 years old he said shaking his head We never catch upMexico has just four judges per 100000 residents five times below the global average according to the University of Puebla study There are only 35 public prosecutors per 100000 residents also well below the global averageBefore she left Acapulco Ms Victoria said she was threatened by the father of one alleged gang member For weeks at a time the father would appear outside the school where Ms Victorias son studies and would show her the gun under his belt she saidI know where you live she said he told her I know where you live too jerk she recalled replyingOther times when she arrived at court for hearings in the other kidnap cases the father stood on a nearby corner staring at her she saysIn several hearings alleged gang members have made slashing motions across their throats to the victims families according to two parents of victims The presiding judge and prosecutors witnessed this but did nothing said the family members Jos Miguel Campechano whose daughter Itzel was kidnapped and was the only victim of the alleged gang freed alive said he got a threatening visit to his office at a private hospital shortly after the gang was caught Parents and siblings of the person accused of having picked Itzel as a kidnap victim were sitting in the waiting roomAn older brother asked him to drop the case recalled Mr Campechano He told me Your daughter is alive you are alive others diedMr Campechano took it as a threat he said in an interview As he talked he pulled open a drawer to his desk and showed a visiting reporter his gun They come for me I am readyMr

is less effective as Beijings clampdown on excess corporate debt has tightened creditAfter years of rapid growth Evergrandes expansion plans are now increasingly challenged by rising financing costs a slowing domestic economy and a lacklustre property market The company is scrambling to find new sources of growth while being forced to fund its core property business at extraordinarily high costEvergrande Chief Executive Xia Haijun faces the challenge of reducing the developers heavy debts even as China works to cool the countrys overheated property market  ReutersAnalysts say that Evergrandes recent multibilliondollar bond offerings at unusually high rates of up to 1375 per cent underscore the mounting financial pressures The decision by the companys billionaire chairman Xu Jiayin to subscribe to more than 1bn of the bonds was designed to steady investor confidence as the property market spiralled downwards in early 2018Evergrande does face some refinancing risks with the company needing to deal with almost Rmb300bn 434bn of debt next year 2019 said Matthew Chow an analyst at SampP Global RatingsThis article is from the Nikkei Asian Review a global publication with a uniquely Asian perspectives on politics the economy business and international affairs Our own correspondents and outside commentators from around the world share their views on Asia while our Asia300 section provides indepth coverage of 300 of the biggest and fastestgrowing listed companies from 11 economies outside JapanSubscribe  Group subscriptionsThat wall of debt repayment prompted the rating agency to warn in 2018 that the company had a less than adequate liquidity level SampP noted that Evergrandes liquidity profile remained weaker than its peers of similar scale or ratingThe debt was built over a decade to fund a programme of aggressive land purchases as Chinese property prices smashed records year in year out Net debt to total assets rose from 238 per cent in 2008 to 1837 per cent in 2017 while property prices in Beijing tripled during the periodBut as Chinas property market began to cool in 2018 Evergrande realised it needed to do more to address its debt burden In 2017 it had raised Rmb130bn from the sale of a stake in unlisted Hengda Real Estate Group to strategic investors But from the start of this year it began slowing down land purchases and used the cash from sales to reduce debt further Its gearing ratio or net debt to total equity fell from 1837 per cent at end of 2017 to 1273 per cent in the first six months of 2018Yet that figure is still well above the level of Chinas two top developers Country Garden Holdings at 59 per cent and China Vanke at 327 per cent Moreover it still has Rmb6711bn in outstanding gross debt of which 445 per cent comes due in mid2019Its a good sign that Evergrande is making an effort to bring down its debt but it is not enough to convince investors that its balance sheet is healthy said Alan Jin head of property research for Asia excluding Japan at Mizuho SecuritiesEven as the companys debt rose so too did the personal wealth of Xu Jiayin Evergrandes chairman and founder The 60yearold is mainland Chinas richest real estate executive with assets estimated at Rmb215bn according to this years Hurun Report which tracks the countrys wealthiest peopleThe former boss of a stateowned steel factory in central Henan Province founded Evergrande in 1996 not long after he had relocated to Shenzhen which borders Hong Kong and was the centre of Chinas economic reformsWithin 10 years Mr Xu had turned the group into one of the largest property companies in southern China by aggressively acquiring land and launching new projectsHe became the countrys richest man after listing Evergrande on the Hong Kong stock exchange in 2009 That listing and the access to capital it brought helped Evergrande to further expand its empire as household incomes rose on the wave of urbanisation that swept China in the new millenniumEvergrande is known for its prowess in securing land for developing large residential projects Over the years it has accumulated the largest land bank among Chinese developers reaching 312m sq m at the end of 2017 compared with 132m sq m for Vanke and 282m sq m for Country GardenEvergrandes sales surpassed Rmb100bn for the first time in 2014 and the company rose to become Chinas largest developer by sales in 2016 Competitors were catching up fast however benefiting from the same trends that drove Evergrande A year later it had fallen to third place although it still notched up Rmb5001bn in salesA visitor looks at a model of a new apartment complex at a showroom of Evergrande Real Estate Group in Wuhan Hubei Province  ReutersAbout 98 per cent of Evergrandes business is in residential property development which has been one of the most lucrative businesses in China as the populations of its main cities exploded Beijing Shanghai and Shenzhen are among the worlds top 10 most expensive cities in terms of housing affordability according to a survey this year by Numbeo an online database operator that specialises in tracking consumer pricesBut the winds began to shift Chinas booming property market has begun to slow as the trade dispute with the US has hit consumer confidence Analysts and economists expect the volume of home sales to drop by up to 10 per cent in 2019 and some developers have started slashing prices as much as 30 per cent to speed up sales and pay down their debtsFor the first time since listing China Evergrandes balance sheet did not expand dramatically Mr Jin said referring to the first half of 2018 Its total assets during the sixmonth period rose 185 per cent compared with increases of 493 per cent in 2017 and 852 per cent in 2016 for the same periodMr Jin said the figures were more a reflection of its past strength as it typically takes one to two years for sales revenue to be reflected on developers balance sheets Its land bank a more forwardlooking indicator of a developers ability to sell in the future declined 2 per cent in the first half compared with the end of 2017Evergrandes sales growth has also slowed For the first 11 months of 2018 yearonyear contract sales rose 138 per cent compared with fullyear growth of 342 per cent last year But in November contract sales actually fell down 291 per cent in the month on a year earlier The shrinking revenue stream has weighed on Evergrandes ability to pay down debts Mr Jin saidAs well as the unexpected bond issue the company is looking at other ways to raise funds It plans to list Hengda Real Estate on the Shenzhen stock exchange as part of the agreement with investors who invested Rmb130bn in 2017 Evergrande has a commitment to buy back their shares if it fails to float the business by January 2020 It is in talks with market regulators about a detailed listing planThe commitment to buy back the shares is seen as one of the biggest risks facing the company in the short term There are concerns that Chinese authorities may not be keen to see a listing and a revitalised property developer with a large war chest as it tries to clamp down on runaway property pricesThe governments stance to suppress property prices is very clear said Wang Dan a Beijingbased analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit The government will not lift restrictions which include price caps and a ban on multiple home purchases anytime soon despite the economic slowdown she saidWe see a lot of uncertainties there said Franco Leung associate managing director at Moodys Investors Service Hong Kong Evergrande will face extremely high financing pressure if the Ashare listing plan falls throughGiven the difficulties in property Evergrande has been seeking alternative engines of future growth Yet some analysts argue that the challenges are even greater to find a profitable business model beyond what Evergrande knows bestThe company has placed its bets on a range of sectors from nextgeneration research to automotive technology and even cinemas The strategy has not always paid offIn 2017 Evergrande agreed to pay 2bn for a 45 per cent stake in Californiabased electric vehicle startup Faraday Future which is controlled by Chinese tycoon Jia YuetingThen in November as the US and China exchanged salvos in the mounting trade war the Trump administration cited Evergrandes investment in Faraday is an illustrative example of how Chinese companies were deployed by Beijing to obtain cuttingedge technology and intellectual propertyEvergrande says its investment in Faraday which was approved by US authorities was a purely commercial decision Nevertheless the outcry is a blow to its reputation as it seeks to diversify its revenue baseIn addition to Faraday Evergrande spent Rmb145bn in September for a 41 per cent stake in BMW distributor Guanghui Group It has also struck a deal with the China Academy of Sciences to invest Rmb100bn in technology research over the next 10 yearsFinally Evergrande has followed fellow developer Dalian Wanda Commercial Properties into the movie business acquiring two Beijingbased cinema operators for Rmb595m in OctoberThis scattershot investment strategy has puzzled many analysts and investors I dont think the new businesses provide any help to Evergrandes earnings and the risks are very high said Danielle Wang a China property analyst at DBS VickersEvergrande like many Chinese property developers that are pushing for diversified portfolios lacks the expertise required to distinguish promising technologies from the bad ones she saidMr Jin of Mizuho Securities said Evergrandes aggressive investments in sectors other than property reflects the anxiety shared by other developers facing a souring property marketHowever many believe that Beijing would never allow the current property slowdown to become a crisis The sector is simply too important to the overall economy said Lee Wee Liat head of property research at BNP ParibasWhen the overall economy gets worse property market conditions will actually get better he saidRelaxing restrictions on property has been a vital tool for Beijing to pump up the economy There is plenty of scope to do this say analysts given the serial crackdowns that have been imposed in the past two years At least two cities have begun a tentative loosening by ending bans on apartment sales according to media reports However this is seen more as a stabilisation measure rather than a radical lifting of constraintsOnce more significant policy incentives kick in big developers such as Evergrande could benefit from a new wave of bank credit backed by the huge assets it built up in the early days of growth In short Evergrandes size may be its saving grace Being big is very important in China Mr Lee saidA version of this article was first published by the Nikkei Asian Review on December 21 2018 2018 Nikkei Inc All rights reserved

regulations,https://www.ft.com/content/62f74704-0abf-11e9-9fe8-acdb36967cfc,2018-12-30 18:02:35,Some of the most popular apps for Android smartphones including Skyscanner TripAdvisor and MyFitnessPal are transmitting data toFacebook without the consent of users in a potential breach of EU regulationsIn a study of 34 popular Android apps the campaign group Privacy International found that at least 20 of them send certain data to Facebook the second that they are opened on a phone before users can be asked for permissionInformation sent instantly included the apps name the users unique ID with Google and the number of times the app was opened and closed since being downloaded Some such as travel site Kayak later sent detailed information about peoples flight searches to Facebook including travel dates whether the user had children and which flights and destinations they had searched forEuropean law on datasharing changed in May with the introduction of General Data Protection Regulation and mobile apps are required to have the explicit consent of users before collecting their personal information Fines for breaching GDPR can be up to 4 per cent of revenues or 20m whichever is greaterThe researchers looked at apps with builtinFacebook trackers and intercepted data as it was sentMany of the apps are free suggesting that they make money from datasharing and advertisingFrederike Kaltheuner who carried out the research added that while Facebook places responsibility for complying with regulations on app developers the US companys developer kit did not give the option of waiting for a users permission before transmitting some types of dataAt least four weeks after GDPR it wasnt even possible to ask for consent because of the default setting of Facebooks SDK software development kit This means data is automatically shared the moment the app opens she saidSeveral app developers have complained about the issue to Facebook since May filing bug reports on Facebooks developer platform saying they were unable to comply with the lawFor instance on May 29 four days afterGDPR came into effect in the EU a developer posted Hi all We analized sic network activity of Facebook SDK for Unity and found that on application start it sends some requests to graphfacebookcom It seems to be violation of GDPR we can not send anything about a user until he allows us to do that Could you please fix that or strongly confirm that these requests dont violate GDPRA few weeks and several complaints later Facebook responded to say it had created a fix but that developers would need to download the upgrade to use it But developers have continued to file bug reports and it is not clear if the fix worksSix months after the release of the feature we are still seeing very little evidence that developers are implementing it Of all the apps that we have tested 677 per cent automatically transmit data to Facebook the moment the app is launched the Privacy International report notedA Facebook spokesperson said that app developers could disable automatic data collection and that this year it had introduced a new option that allows developers to delay collection of app analytics informationThe researchers also found that many apps were running older versions of the SDK as recently as this month that would not allow them to use the voluntary feature as it was designedAnother major concern raised by activists is the deanonymisation of the data the practice of linking personal data back to a user which is prohibited by GDPRFacebook can tie an Android ID to a users social network profile instantly identifying them and adding any additional information to their personal profileFor example an individual who has installed the following apps that we have tested Qibla Connect a Muslim prayer app Period Tracker Clue a period tracker Indeed a job search app My Talking Tom a childrens app could be potentially profiled as likely female likely Muslim likely job seeker likely parent the report saidFacebook can also use the data to crosstarget multiple people for example if a married couple use apps on the same WiFi or at the same location their Android IDs can be tied together to target similar advertising to both of themPrevious research from Oxford university has shown that 43 per cent offree apps on the Google Play store could share data with Facebook making the social network the second most prevalent thirdparty tracker after Googles parent company AlphabetA Facebook spokesperson wrote to the Privacy International researchers in response to their study saying We agree that  its important for people to have access when we receive information about them when theyre not using our services and to have control over whether we associate this information with themRecognising the value of improvements in this area were currently working on a suite of changes including developing a new tool called Clear History that we hope will address your feedbackA Skyscanner spokesperson saidWe were not aware that data was being sent to Facebook in this way without prior consent from our users which went against our own internal rules on the integration of thirdparty technologies We are still investigating how this happenedWere currently reviewing our approach both to this issue and to the use of similar technologies more generally to ensure were doing everything we should beTripAdvisor and Kayak did not respond to requests for comment and MyFitnessPal declined to comment

thirdlargest wireless carrier The company hopes to weaken that association SoftBank is listing its telecoms arm shares in the unit were due to begin trading on December 19th after The Economist had gone to press SoftBank Group was expected to raise 26trn 234bn by selling off just over a third of the company It is selling 176bn shares for 1500 each making it Japans biggestever initial public offering and only just shy of the record set by Alibaba a Chinese ecommerce titan in which SoftBank Group owns a stake of about 29 in 2014 Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editors Picks That is good going for a firm whose earnings have been lacklustre and which faces big challenges Providing mobile services is a lucrative affair in Japanprices are far higher than in other developed countries But it is also a mature business and the population is shrinking SoftBank has a quarter of the market trailing NTT DoCoMo and au NTT DoCoMo has already said it will slash prices after pressure from the government to lower costs the other two are likely to have to follow suit Next year the trio will face new competition from Rakuten a Japanese ecommerce giant that is about to become the nations fourth mobilenetwork operator Other problems are more particular to SoftBank A service outage lasting over four hours affecting 34m customers mainly in Tokyo and Osaka sent its shares down by as much as 6 in trading on December 6th And the firm has said it may have to spend money replacing all the hardware in its 4 G and 5 G networks that it gets from Huawei one of its main suppliers after Japan became the latest country to air security concerns about the Chinese firm Even so the Japanese public bombarded by TV advertisements for the listing has flocked to buy shares SoftBank benefits both from domestic investors lack of options and its own strong brand For them putting in 1500 and receiving a relatively high dividend payout of around 5 with no currency risk is an attractive proposition Mrs Watanabe is looking at yield not the fundamentals in the long term says Chris Lane an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein a research firm referring to the proverbial Japanese retail investor The IPO s attractions are equally clear for Masayoshi Son SoftBanks founder who is shifting his firm away from telecoms towards investing in tech entrepreneurs around the world Through his Vision Fund an investment vehicle financed in large part by Saudi Arabias sovereignwealth fund he has bought stakes in companies such as Uber WeWork and Arm a British chip firm The IPO is a way to take some cash out of a part of SoftBank that is not growing as swiftly and to put it into racier bets while retaining control Mr Son also hopes the sale may solve his main frustration since he veered away from telecoms to backing tech founders that investors do not properly appreciate SoftBanks transformation and that they therefore undervalue it The companys shares have been trading at a hefty discount of around 40 to the value of its assets see chart This discount arises in part because many telecomsfocused investors in the group are not thrilled to see their cash being funnelled into risky and opaque tech investments at high prices Now these investors will be able to buy shares in a more predictable phone company while those with a higher risk appetite can stay with SoftBank Closing the discount depends on a number of factors however What happens to the groups high level of debt will be critical SoftBank has around 18trn of interestbearing debt or over six times its operating earnings thanks partly to its acquisition of Sprint an American telecoms firm for 20bn in 2012 The risk the debt mountain poses is the concern most often cited by investors says Mr Lane Some of this debt will go to the separately listed mobile unit and may be nonrecourse meaning that SoftBank may no longer be liable for it if the subsidiary defaults For now Japans negative interest rates adopted by the Bank of Japan in 2016 as part of its quantitativeeasing programme allow firms to borrow without worrying too much they should remain for at least a year Critics complain too that Mr Sons plans are wildly ambitious but unclear and that key man risk around him remains too high That suggests hopes for a rerating of the parents shares may go unanswered Investors in the mobile arm might face an additional governance risk if the subsidiary tries to please its parent and majority stakeholder rather than ensure returns for minority shareholders As for the Vision Fund itself Mr Son was criticised for failing to distance himself from Saudi Arabia when its crown prince Mohammed bin Salman was linked to the killing of a Saudi journalist in its embassy in Turkey in October Startups might be more reluctant to accept Mr Sons cash as a result some rival tech investors say Early divestments from the fund seem to have worked well however When Walmart bought SoftBanks stake in Flipkart an Indian ecommerce firm in May it reportedly paid almost double what SoftBank did less than a year earlier SoftBank invested in Uber at a valuation of around 48bn reports suggest its valuation will be north of 100bn when it lists on the stockmarket possibly in the first quarter of 2019 Next to that kind of money the telecoms business expected to make 700bn of operating profit this year looks like small fry This article appeared in the Business section of the print edition under the headline A phoneless vision

robots to recognize and avoid cables and even building a feature to tell you when it finds something under the couch like your keys Or dog poop Sadly for the world and my carpet we arent there yet Since these robot vacuums cant clean stairs or couch cushions they likely cant be your only vacuum The Shark Ion S87 comes with a small hand vac that shares the dock with the robot but even it wasnt enough for really serious messes Many of these vacs have trouble with wet messes The Ecovacs Deebot Ozmo 930 has a clever solution a builtin water reservoir and attachable pad that turns the robot into a mop It works well enough but the Ecovacs cant be both vacuum and mop simultaneously and switching modes often took longer than just wiping up my coffee spills For many people a robot vac still seems like an expensive luxury rather than a household necessity But it is true luxury Heres what my vacuum routine is like now I press the button on the robot to start cleaning or open its corresponding app and start it that way All five of my testers have straightforward apps that let you start or schedule a cleaning remotely and integrate with voice assistants to do the same Then I go for a walk or head to work When I come back everything is just as I left it except now my floor is clean The Smarts For some like the Eufy cleaning and getting back to base is about where the smarts end Higherend models do much more The Neato generates a floor plan of your home as it works then allows you to draw virtual lines in the app to tell the vacuum where not to go The Roomba i7 the most expensive vacuum I tested creates a similar floor plan and allows you to choose where the robot should clean You can say Alexa tell Roomba to clean the kitchen and off it goes Over time the smartest of these products will be much more robot than vacuum Since they know where everything is in your house and can move around it vacuums could be a handy place from which to control and manage your smart home The house needs to get better at understanding itself Mr Angle said Buying a robot vacuum is a bit like buying a car in that theres no one choice thats right for everyone If youre only worried about the basics you dont need to spend much The Eufy Robovac 30c is a good vacuum that takes the job out of your hands I didnt test its cheaper sibling the 150 Robovac 11s but the only difference between the two is the WiFi connection so if you dont care about the app you can save even more money If you want the grand luxury vehicle of the bunch theres just no beating the Roomba i7 It cant mopI wish it couldbut the Roomba has a useful app and lots of smart features It just does its job really well Its crowning feature is a dustbin built into its base Instead of emptying the vacuum every time you run it you empty it every few weeks And there are cheaper versions of this bot too without some of these extras After a few days I hardly even thought about the Roomba i7 which is exactly what I was looking for I dont vacuum anymore but my floors are clean Im living the dream For more WSJ Technology analysis reviews advice and headlines sign up for our weekly newsletter And

economy in part because unlike China India promised a level playing field for foreign firms to compete against local companies Now that field may be tilting toward domestic startups amid a global backlash against US tech titans according to analysts and industry officialsWith national elections approaching early next year Indias government said Wednesday it is tightening restrictions on foreign ecommerce players the latest move in recent months that restrains their freedom to operate compared with local firms The new rules present a fresh challenge toAmazoncomInc andWalmart Incas they aim for growing slices of a market where many of Indias 13 billion people are starting to shop online thanks to inexpensive smartphones and dataVinay Kesari a Bangalorebased technology lawyer specializing in regulatory matters who has worked with US tech firms said such moves to rein in foreign tech companies have been highly unusual and may be a sign of more to comeIve never seen anything like this happening he said All bets are off at this pointThis weeks announcement came after the emergence in August of private draft government rules stipulating that data created by users in India from online sellers search engines and social media must be stored exclusively in India with the government granted accessThese regulations which analysts say may be enacted in the coming months could affectAlphabet IncsGoogleFacebook Incand its popular WhatsApp messaging servicewhich like most internet companies use servers around the world To house data locally the firms might have to make use of local data centers analysts say Meanwhile new regulations from the Reserve Bank of India went into effect in October mandating that payments firms store all data only in India a potential headache for Visa MastercardAmerican ExpressandPayPalbut not for domestic payments companies such as fastgrowing PaytmFacebooks WhatsApp has more than 200 million users in the South Asian nation more than any other country With its parent company pushing to monetize the free service WhatsApp earlier this year rolled out a test payments system to nearly one million people It allows users to connect their apps to their banks and make payments via chat a free feature that could make it the default for digital money given WhatsApps vast reachWhatsApp stores paymentsrelated data locally in India a spokesman said and would like to expand its test It hasnt yet done so A spokesman for the Reserve Bank of India didnt immediately respond to a query about whether WhatsApp would be allowed to expand its serviceEarlier this year Indian politicians and authorities blamed WhatsApp after a spate of lynchings triggered by rumors spread on the platform WhatsApp has introduced features to slow the spread of false news but officials have pushed for more details about the source of the misinformationA spokesman for Google said the company is reviewing the draft regulationsA Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment as did a spokesman for Visa Representatives for Mastercard American Express and PayPal didnt immediately respond to a request for commentWith Amazon a distant alsoran to domestic rivals in China founder Jeff Bezos has pledged 5 billion to boost its operations in India It is now a leading player having built out its logistics network and tweaked its app for Indian users Walmart in May bought the countrys biggest homegrown ecommerce startup for 16 billion its largest acquisition ever as it seeks growth abroadWe remain committed to a longterm investment in India an Amazon spokeswoman said We have always operated in compliance with the laws of the land and are evaluating the new guidelinesA Walmart spokeswoman said Thursday that Indias ecommerce sector has created hundreds of thousands of jobs and should be a major contributor to the countrys economic growth Government policy will play a role and it is important that a broad marketdriven framework be developed through a consultative process in order to drive the industry forward she saidIndia represents a potential gold mine for American internet firms The country now has 390 million internet users more than the US and second only to China according to a report from consulting firm Bain amp CoPercapita gross domestic product in India today is about one third lower than Chinas a decade ago meaning purchasing power is limited But US companies dont want to miss out as Indians form brand loyalties and flock to new kinds of productsThe flurry of regulations have been surprising Mr Kesari said because US business groups have successfully lobbied in the past to get Indian policy makers to dial back potentially aggressive changesThere is increasing global awareness of the amount of information US tech firms control following revelations about Facebooks leak of user information to data firm Cambridge Analytica and Googles exposure of data from its Google social networkId like you to believe there is a red carpet in India not red tape Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a speech in Japan in 2014 seeking to improve Indias image as a place for foreign investors to do businessThe focus of this government has changed said an India technology veteran declining to be named given sensitivities about government criticism in India During its first years it worked to bring in foreign investment but is now hoping to implement policies that help smaller sellersThe government realized both Amazon and Walmart are deep into the market and they are not going anywhere

apocalypse avoided a small area of real estate in New York City looks prime again But who stands to benefitwhether it be landlords renters buyers or businessesis now a question up for debate in and beyond the five boroughsNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo made the surprise announcement on Thursday the L train subway tunnel between Manhattan and Brooklyn will not be shutting down for 15 monthspreviously scheduled to start on April 27 2019as originally planned The closure had been in the works for years in order to repair damage incurred during Hurricane Sandy in 2012 when the subway tunnel was submerged by floodwatersThe news of Lpocalypse avoided is a welcome development and is expected to result in an upswing of renting and buying activity in Williamsburg Aleksandra Scepanovic managing director of New York real estate firm Ideal Properties Group tells Fortune People who may have been considering moving out of the area for a year or two of the shutdown are likely to reverse their thinking and stay putBrooklyns Williamsburg and Greenpoint neighborhoods have steadily seen rents rise sharply over the last decade but are also often derided as hotbeds of gentrification with an influx of luxury highrises mass market retailers and a younger professional crowd of renters and buyers often working in tech and financeWith the news of an official shutdown local businesses and residents had been dreading a future without a vital transit link to the area with many landlords offering incentives to keep tenants as some renters already prepared to leave the neighborhood altogether While perhaps a relief to some current L train straphangers even though the canceled shutdownmeaning the L train will continue to run at least sometimesnot everyone was pleased with Cuomos announcement right away and no shortage of unanswered questionsThursdays news will definitely raise the confidence level of all the above business categories knowing that their customers will be much less inconvenienced If they havent moved residents looking to leave will reconsider says Jason Pennington managing director of retail brokerage at RIPCO Real Estates Brooklyn office But given that there will still be significant schedule changes with night and weekend construction work Pennington warns the shutdown could still be an issue for local businesses and restaurants catering to tourists and outer borough residentsBefore Thursdays announcement the local real estate market was downand continuing to go down according to Warner Lewis an agent at Halstead a real estate firm covering the tristate area Many developers had pulled units off the market and were repricing them lower landlords were giving very robust concessions and individual sellers were having to discount prices to get deals doneAdam Meshberg a resident of Williamsburg as well as founder and principal of architecture and design firm Meshberg Group concurred that the market had been getting softer but suggested things could turn around quicklyOne client called today and shared they were about to rent one of their units for a twoyear contract under market value to fill the space Meshberg said Minutes before signing the contract they heard the announcement and are no longer renting it under valueScepanovic thinks both landlords and tenants could stand to benefit from the news the most obvious being tenants and buyers wont have to worry about a significant disruption to their commutes Landlords and sellers of course will be able to continue with business as usualEveryone wants to hear that its the landlords who will benefit the most but there is a tremendous benefit to the renters and buyers adds Andrew Barrocas CEO of MNS Real Estate in Brooklyn Residents can get their kids to school in the city get to work etc And of course landlords will reap the benefit Its not black and whiteFor prospective tenants who might have been hoping to take advantage of what were expected to be lower rents there might still be a smallvery smallwindow of opportunityWinter temperatures in New York City always have a cooling effect on property pricesboth on sales and rental fronts and this year is no exception Scepanovic says The pricing is likely to correct upward and the incentives may start falling off in the warmer months aheadFor rentals specifically the difference will be felt immediately Lewis says Concessions will pull back and there will be more potential tenants in the market he explained This is the biggest possible gift in 2019 that landlords in Williamsburg could have hoped forThe crucial transit link also helps with the real estate market for surrounding neighborhoodsperhaps most notably to the immediate north in Long Island City where Amazonjust announced it is planning to open a massive new headquarters Within days and even days before the HQ2 reveal late last year apartment listing searches and bids for condos in the Queens neighborhood surged immediately Keeping the L train alive will also mean Williamsburg is directly linked to Googles current base on the western side of Manhattan as the Internet giant plans another New York campus not too far south along the Hudson RiverEric Benaim CEO and founder of LICbased brokerage Modern Spaces says that other markets that were betting on the L train shutting down as a way to drive more traffic to their neighborhoods and buildings will have to be more competitive nowScepanovic suspects that a substantial portion of the incoming Amazon HQ staff working in Long Island City will likely settle in Greenpoint and Williamsburg as well as Manhattans Midtown East and Astoria just to the north of Long Island City in QueensThe selection of LIC as the Amazons partial HQ destination is yet

by a grandparent finding love on a transatlantic flight a bitter family feud played out in the courts and press a 900m buyout to seize control of a 167yearold storied company and a promise fulfilled It has it all But Ms Dreyfus now the majority shareholder of Louis Dreyfus Company one of the worlds biggest traders of crops and foodstuffs is keen to separate fact from fiction In a rare interview weeks after the 56yearold Russianborn heiress secured financing to complete the buyout of the group from family members she hit back at suggestions she was squeezing the commodity trader for cash Weve got a very solid repayment plan that in no way damages the business she said Once the buyout is complete in the next couple of months Ms LouisDreyfus will cement her control over the company founded in 1851 by Lopold Louis Dreyfus allowing her to reposition it and strike strategic partnerships Today LDC is one of the worlds biggest traders of grains soyabeans coffee and cotton employing about 17000 people across the globe Its turnover in the first six months of 2018 was almost 19bn It is a big relief not only for me personally but also for the company added Ms Louis Dreyfus whose rise from circuit board seller in the former Soviet Union to the majority shareholder of LDC is one of the most remarkable stories in the natural resources industry Born in 1962 Margarita Bogdanova was orphaned at the age of 11 when her parents died in a train accident Raised by a grandfather in Leningrad now St Petersburg she graduated with a diploma in accounting from the local school of commerce She met Robert the great grandson of Leopold in 1988 on a flight between Zurich and New York They married three years later and had three sons Ms LouisDreyfus also has twin girls with her partner Philipp Hildebrand former chairman of Swiss National Bank Before Roberts death in 2009 Ms LouisDreyfus promised she would safeguard the business Since then she has steadily strengthened her grip becoming chair of LDH in 2011 Sometimes portrayed in the press as a mysterious Russian who married into wealth the determined heiress was soon at loggerheads with other members of the Dreyfus clan including two of Roberts sisters As Ms LouisDreyfus became more involved in the business they exercised a clause in a shareholder agreement forcing her to buy most of their remaining shares in LDCs parent company Louis Dreyfus Commodity Holdings BV LDH A longrunning saga ensued After several years of legal wrangling the two sides finally agreed a value for the shares and Ms LouisDreyfus revealed in November that she had secured a loan to finance the buyout This will see Akira her family trust own more than 95 per cent of LDH up from 80 per cent Robert always said it was preferable to have a strong shareholder than to serve the interest of multiple shareholders said Ms LouisDreyfus A successful businessman in his own right Mr LouisDreyfus returned to the family company in 2006 at the age of 60 and led a radical restructuring He was worth an estimated 7bn when he died News of the buyout came just a month after LDC declared a 411m dividend in spite of a sharp drop in halfyear profits fuelling speculation that Ms LouisDreyfus was squeezing the business for cash to fund the purchase Akira was set up with one purpose to protect the business not drain it of cash she said explaining the 411m payment revealed in October was made up of dividends declared in 2016 and 2017 plus a special dividend of 100m related to the sale of its metals business The payments are completely inline with our dividend policy We never pay out more than 50 per cent of annual earnings added Ms LouisDreyfus Those are the facts Like its rivals Archer Daniels Midland Bunge Cargill and Glencore Genevaheadquartered LDC has been battling tough markets conditions and structural shifts in trading that have depressed profits across the industry and forced companies to rethink how they do business In 2012 LDC recorded net income of more than 950m last year it generated just 305m The traditional model of buying crops storing them in silos and trading the inventory is being pressured by advances in technology and greater market transparency In order to protect margins food traders have been moving downstream into more complex processing activities and shifting their geographic footprint towards Asia where there are favourable demographics and China where the proportion of protein in diets is rising Ms LouisDreyfus said she was satisfied with LDCs recent results given the difficult market conditions although the companys debts were a little higher than she would like LDCs net income fell 37 per cent to 100m in the six months to June while its adjusted net debt hit 356bn up from 26bn at the start of the year That pushed net debt to 46 times earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation well above the longterm target of 3 The yield on its bonds due in February 2022 has risen to almost 38 per cent from 25 per cent in September LDC executives said the spike in net debt reflected higher working capital utilisation over the period mainly because of larger inventories and other capital items They added that the decline in halfyear profits included losses on derivatives used to lock in margins in its soycrushing operations which should be reversed by the end of the year and into 2019 Higher debt weaker gross margins a 37 per cent drop in net profit and reduced equity is not a very good trend said JeanFranois Lambert of Lambert Commodities a consultancy Hopefully the secondhalf results will show that the strategy put in place to secure the margins pays off Keen to set the record straight Ms LouisDreyfus said she has no involvement in the daytoday running of LDC and becomes animated when the conversation turns to the turnover of senior managers and whether she has clashed with executives Since Serge Schoen stepped down in 2013 LDC has had a string of chief executives The latest Ian McIntosh replaced Gonzalo Ramrez Martiarena a hardcharging Argentine who left the company in September Ms LouisDreyfus is quick to point out that two of the CEOs were internal appointees given the job on a temporary basis while LDC looked for a permanent successor to Mr Schoen She notes one appointee Mayo Schmidt who was named CEO in 2014 never took up the job All this stuff about changing CEOsits just incorrect Still the sudden departure of Mr Ramirez on the same day as chief financial officer Armand Lumens who left for personal reasons shocked the industry Ms LouisDreyfus is tightlipped on the reason why Mr Ramirez left and will not say if it was related to his management style I cannot say why he left but I can say it was not because of a clash over strategy or discovery of some misconduct or anything like that It was also not my initiative she said I would like to repeat that Gonzalo did a good job Mr Ramirez declined to comment on his departure when contacted by the Financial Times Under Mr Ramirez LDC had refocused on its core operations trading grain and oilseeds selling its metal and fertiliser businesses and searching for a partner to invest in its orange juice business After three years of consolidation under Mr Ramirez Ms LouisDreyfus said the focus was now on growing and positioning LDC as a diversified food and nutrition company as well as a commodity trader This evolution will be led by Mr McIntosh who joined the company as a trainee in 1986 and was running LDCs hedge fund business until it closed last year In a recent interview with the FT Mr McIntosh said he fully supported the companys plans to realign its geographic footprint towards Asia and move further downstream into areas such as processing As part of that strategy LDC recently opened a new crushing plant in Tianjin China Mr McIntosh is also keen to sharpen LDCs edge in trading using its physical footprint of assets to really understand global supply and demand balances move into food ingredients and invest alongside others in next generation proteins and agritech startups To achieve fair and sustainable value creation Ms LouisDreyfus said all options would be considered from joint ventures to strategic partnerships acquisitions and even a stock market flotation Why not if it helps the business Nothing can be excluded she said Everything is changing so quickly so I dont know and probably no one knows how the business how the agricultural business will look in 10 years time But the tycoons widow is clear on one thing she is now in control My family trust has now the full freedom to make decisions

activity,https://www.ft.com/content/06b343fe-0447-11e9-99df-6183d3002ee1,2018-12-21 04:00:27,Dealmaking has decelerated rapidly from the record pace seen at the start of 2018 with the final three months of this year poised to be the quietest period for mergers and acquisitions since the third quarter of 2017Companies have agreed deals worth 761bn since the start of October down more than 25 per cent from the pace seen in the first and second quarters when a blistering 12tn worth of transactions each were struck according to the data provider RefinitivThe slowdown follows a turbulent stretch across global stock marketsIf we dont get more stability there is a good chance that even fewer deals will be announced in 2019 said Scott Barshay a corporate lawyer at Paul Weiss Only one deal worth more than 20bn was agreed in the fourth quarter and of the 20 largest transactions of 2018 just two were clinched since October including IBMs 32bn takeover of cloud computing group Red HatSeveral advisers said the recent market turbulence could make it difficult for buyers and sellers to come to an agreement on price when attempting to strike a deal Bidders have already cut their offers in several live auctions using the recent share price drops as a justification Boards have so far been reluctant to accept the lower offers given the alltime highs hit by global stocks in SeptemberWhile several bankers and lawyers who spoke to the Financial Times said they expected a slowdown in dealmaking several offered the caveat that the deceleration would be temporary and that companies continued to evaluate transformational acquisitions The MampA cycle still has room to grow said Robin Rankin cohead of global MampA at Credit Suisse A lot of people are making moves When they do they are more focused on largerscale transactions that move the needle To me this signals more confidence and a desire to really change portfoliosThis year had a wave of deals that fit that mould with companies such as General Electric United Technologies Comcast Vodafone Keurig Green Mountain and Broadcom reshaping themselves through multibilliondollar transactions The challenge for many companies was regulatory roadblocks in Washington Brussels and BeijingHernan Cristerna cohead of global MampA at JPMorgan Chase noted that regulatory hurdles were generating board room uncertainty when it comes to pursuing transformational dealsCollapse of China dealsAn intensifying trade war between the US and China has only added to the pressure building against corporate Chinese acquisitions between the countries in 2018While Chinese companies agreed to 182bn worth of crossborder deals this year up 17 per cent from 2017 takeovers of US groups slid 15 per cent Overall activity remains below the record activity seen in 2016 when 258bn of crossborder deals involving a Chinese group were clinched Part of the slowdown is a result of Chinas crackdown on aggressive overseas deal makers such as HNA Dalian Wanda and Anbang an effort that has gathered momentum since early 2017But more hawkish national security policy in the west has helped to turn away Chinese buyers from developed markets Chinese MampA into the US fell to 93bn with the number of deals off by a quarter according to Refinitiv The landscape is definitely changing We are seeing fewer outbound Chinese deals James Tam head of AsiaPacific MampA at Morgan Stanley But for something that is strategic in nature in a less sensitive industry you can still get things done with careful executionUnderlying the trade dispute between the worlds two largest economies is what the US perceives as a strengthened effort by China to become the world leader in high technology and valuable highend manufacturing often through purchases of foreign intellectual propertyThe reaction has been to block more deals on national security grounds such as Ant Financials 11bn offer for MoneyGram and bolster government checks on inbound investment A law passed in August will give the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US sweeping review powers over even small minority stake purchases in American companies following record Chinese venture capital activity in the US in the first half of the yearBut the pushback against Chinese MampA is not limited to the USIts more of a global phenomenon where globalisation and easy access to markets is becoming more difficult said Greg Peirce head of MampA for Asia Pacific at UBS Australia Germany and Canada have developed stronger national security checks Canada surprised China watchers earlier this year by blocking state builder China Communications Constructions 118 takeover of construction group AeconChina has also sought to exercise its powers to block global deals most notably Qualcomms 44bn acquisition of NXP SemiconductorsOn the structuring side people will be very careful with how they invest in the US and EU said Philip Li a partner at Freshfields But there is still lots of willingness and interest in overseas investment especially in the UK where prices are low2018 had a wave of mega dealsGlobal mergers and acquisition activity was driven by mega deals in 2018 as corporate boardrooms around the world made big bets in an effort to boost revenue growth and better compete against a new tide of digital disrupters across all industriesTransactions worth more than 5bn rose 70 per cent to about 15tn according to Refinitiv representing about 40 per cent of overall volumes in 2018 Deals with a price tag higher than 10bn rose from 28 transactions in 2017 to more than 40 this year including the 77bn acquisition of the Irish drugmaker Shire by its Japanese rival Takeda and Comcasts 48bn takeover of the UK broadcaster SkySteve Arcano a corporate lawyer at Skadden highlighted technology as an impetus Csuite executives see a need to realign or adjust their platforms to adapt to rapidly evolving markets in this disruptive world and they are willing to do significant transactions to address this he saidThe total number of deals in 2018 dropped almost 10 per cent to just under 44000 transactions compared with a year ago according to Refinitiv The biggest drop was in smaller deals under a 1bn which are often considered to be the bread and butter for investment banks advising on MampA Private equity retains dry powderLeveraged buyout activity soared in 2018 to its highest levels since the financial crisis with 10bnplus private equity takeovers becoming more commonAmong the companies private equity groups have circled are aluminium company Arconic cyber security software maker Symantec and television ratings provider NielsenIf completed those transactions would cap a frenetic pace of dealmaking this year which included Blackstones 17bn takeover of Thomson Reuters financial data businessIn total leveraged buyouts worth almost 384bn were agreed in 2018 up 28 per cent from a year previously Leveraged buyouts have crossed the 400bn mark only twice before in history in 2006 and 2007 before the financial crisisThis has been a record year in all respects sponsors have raised significant amounts of new capital and have been very active in both buying and exiting portfolio companies said Rob Pulford Goldman Sachs head of financial and strategic investors group for Europe the Middle East and AfricaDavid Higgins partner at Kirkland amp Ellis said Some uncertainty in the markets may also help PE funds as they search for value opportunities We think that takeprivate transactions will increase as public markets become disconnected from private market valuations The level of dealmaking in the new year will in part depend on the ability of private equity groups to secure financing for their transactions Recent market volatility and higher interest rates have lifted borrowing costs and banks have been wary to underwrite massive chequesWhat is more private equity groups have started to factor in a recession over the next few years into their forecasts when contemplating buyouts Yet buyout groups are sitting on almost 12tn of dry powder money they have raised but have yet to invest with three of the largest funds on record finalised over the past 20 months separate data from Preqin showed Next year I expect to see more carveouts and publictoprivate deals because public markets have come down in their valuations and that presents an opportunity said Simona Maellare the global head of financial sponsors at UBS

explains what it's like to invest in growth companies when competing with SoftBank.,http://fortune.com/2018/12/20/battery-ventures-chelsea-stoner/,2018-12-20 12:01:20,This article originally ran in Term Sheet Fortunes newsletter about deals and dealmakers Sign up hereEarlier this month French President Emmanuel Macron invited a contingent of 40 USbased venture capitalists and limited partners to come talk techInvestors from Andreessen Horowitz Greylock Partners Khosla Ventures and Battery Ventures attended the twoday roadshow in Paris that took place at Station F the Vision Institute iBionext and the Elyse PalaceChelsea Stoner a general partner at Battery Ventures was part of the group that went on the tourThey organized this trip to show how forwardthinking the Macron administration is she told Term Sheet Its clear they want to turn France into more of an innovation capital Its far easier to do business there than some of us thoughtStoner is a growth investor who has risen through the ranks at Battery to become the first and only female partner in the firms 35yearhistory She often pursues softwarehealthcare companies in markets that a lot of other investors overlook Her portfolio includes Avalara which raised 180 million in an IPO earlier this year as well as Brightree Marketo ClearCare and Curve DentalIn a wideranging conversation I caught up with Stoner to get her impression of the French tech ecosystem as well as to learn more about some of her biggest deals and gain insight into her investment strategyTERM SHEET What was the general feeling among the VCs on the tour about investing more capital in European tech companiesSTONER There have been good companies to come out of France Germany and the UK but being able to cross a border and become a large compelling company across Europe is difficult to do A lot of companies tend to be pretty conservative they get to the 50 million level and sell rather than wait for the really big outcome Valley investors on the other hand are willing to take a lot of risk Are we going to take the time to go over there if we think the founders are willing to sell early I dont know thats not really that interesting to us So thats still a big question The sense in France though is that they recognize this so they talked to us a lot about the changing attitudes around risktakingYou went on the trip during the yellow vest protests in Paris What are some of the risks associated with deploying capital in the region STONER Its hard to say Macron and his team have made it much more compelling to do business in France both for entrepreneurs starting a business as well as for investors doing deals The protests and unrest happening there obviously present a big cloud over this I think Macron has this very strong message and I think hes doing everything he should be doing to make it right Europe needs a leader in technology right now and it would be a real shame if he doesnt execute on his plans But right now is a tough time to be in his role for sureYou backed Brightree which was acquired for 800 million At the time the CEO said that Battery helped boost revenues from 8 million to over 100 million What are some things you did to transform the company into an attractive acquisition target STONER First and foremost our management teams operate the businesses and we do everything we can to be helpful Were not giving them playbooks and telling them what to do but we are very helpful when it comes to acquisitions The case with Brightree was that they had never done an acquisition before Once you have the market map of all the companies in and around that space you ask yourself Are there certain technologies to go acquire and sell to your customersThey were seeing pretty dramatic organic growth just from selling their core cloud product to businesses that really needed a cloud product That was tremendous growth Then we ended up doing 6 acquisitions onto the platform and we took something that they were selling for 5000 a year up to at the end 50000 a year You get a customer whos paying so much more because youve unlocked all the value you can offer them through different packagesAnd then it really comes down to the execution of the acquisition We do deals for a living so we should be able to be on the ground helping them execute acquisitions In Brightrees example I was helping them develop relationships with the acquisition targets create models and negotiate the docsWhats going on in the cloud space right now that you think Term Sheet readers should know aboutSTONER The biggest story continues to be the shift to the cloud from the legacy space We think its still in the second or third inning and theres still so much older software out there and new cloud companies coming up all the time What gets me so excited is how that applies to various verticals People can now develop software much more cheaply and be able to go after smaller markets so it makes sense nowLook at the dentist space for example We just invested in Curve Dental which is based up in Calgary Something like 5 of dentists use cloud software today thats pretty incredible So there are still these pockets of different markets out there that could really benefit from the adoption of cloudA lot of your deals are in the healthcaresoftware sector Theres been chatter about using blockchain technology to securely store medical health records for example Are there any further applications you see with the technology as it pertains to healthcareSTONER We as a firm are definitely looking at blockchain I think its a super interesting technology with a lot of different applications I have not seen anything as it applies to healthcare yet It certainly would be a great technology to use for that purpose but I will say healthcare has traditionally sort of lagged in terms of adopting new technology and I think blockchain is still very very new Just thinking about the adoption of something like that in healthcare is still a long way awaySo what are the more imminent healthcare trends on your radar at the momentSTONER The whole trend of the escalating cost of taking care of folks in the hospital is one to watch Were starting to see more and more insurance companies really trying to lower those costs and getting those people from the hospital back in the home We invested in a company called ClearCare which sells software to home care agencies I think well see a lot more of that shift from care outside of the home to care at home and were all over that gameCompanies have access to a lot more capital these days As a growth investor how do you see the venture capital landscape evolving as players like SoftBank enter the marketSTONER Its a very interesting strategy I tend to like that SoftBank is going after the category leaders just like we are They know who those are by the time that theyre investing and putting a ton of money behind them Theyre making very big bets obviously in each of the leaders in the respective markets and its a very good strategy Does it make our jobs tougher as growth investors Yeah It just means we need to be there before SoftBank is We need to find the companies earlier

2019 might be that were poorer than we thought a few weeks ago Statistics Canada changed history last month revising economic growth in 2015 to a mere 07 per cent compared with its original calculation of 1 per cent The 2016 expansion was also cut by threetenths of a percentage point to 11 per cent Merry Christmas Now the central bank must do some recalculating of its own Policy makers have a rough idea of how many goods and services the economy can produce without causing inflation Before StatCans revisions they thought we had reached that point A smaller gross domestic product suggests the pressure to raise interest rates vanished along with the billions of dollars in economic output that only ever happened on paperIts weird to cheer the disappearance of so much wealth but Governor Stephen Poloz and his deputies will benefit from some breathing room At this point in 2017 virtually every major economy was growing Christine Lagarde the managing director of the International Monetary Fund was nudging her institutions members to fix their roofs while the sun was still shining The clouds rolled in faster than most expected President Donald Trumps trade wars are slowing global commerce and upsetting financial markets The tumult could be temporary or it could be the beginning of something terrible its hard to tell The jobless rate in the United States is 37 per cent which must count for something Yet the SampP500 index was on track for its worst year since the financial crisis a decade agoEarlier this autumn DHL Express announced it was adding a new flight to Vancouver from its North American distribution hub in Cincinnati to keep up with a doubledigit increase in demand Absolutely there is strength in the global economy Andrew Williams chief

ago according to Bloomberg News The companys stock price plunged the most in a decade When you have a change that comes on you as fast as this did its hard to react to it Fred Smith the chief

measures they provoked BlackRock Inc the New Yorkbased asset manager with a portfolio of more than 6 trillion says the US could tip into recession as soon as 2020 Thats disconcerting because America is currently the only major economy that still is performing wellMost of the issues that were dealing with today are induced by bad political choicesFred Smith FedEx chief executiveCanada may avoid a downturn although at the price of being condemned to muddling along much like Japan and some of the bigger European economies Weak oil prices and excessive private and public debt could stall the engines that powered the economy clear of the Great Recession If the the trade wars persist exports also will suffer threatening stagnation Growth will be shallow and corrections will be shallow Aubrey Badeo BlackRocks Torontobased head of Canadian fixed income said in an interview A Japan situation could be something we gravitate towards here Were not there yet Most forecasts predict the economy will grow by around 15 per cent next year roughly equivalent to the Bank of Canadas noninflationary speed limit Plans to increase investment and employment often supported by sales expectations are widespread especially in the services sector the central bank says in its latest quarterly Business Outlook Survey BOS released Friday Companies added about 220000 jobs over the 12 months through November around the annual average since 2010 and the unemployment rate has been no higher than six per cent since October 2017 by far the most impressive stretch in data that dates to 1976 Hiring is a lagging indicator but one that says a lot about an economys underlying strength By that measure Canada is fine There is a reason the Bank of Canada felt the need to raise its benchmark interest rate five times from July 2017 to October 2018The Canadian economy begins this new year in a pretty good place Poloz said in an interview with CTV News this week Still the central bank paused earlier this month and most economists and market watchers predict that it will opt to leave its interestrate target unchanged at 175 per cent again in January and probably even at its policy meeting in March Thats a shift the consensus until a couple of weeks ago was that policy makers would move borrowing costs higher first thing in the new year Some analysts now predict an increase in the spring Basdeo said wed be lucky to get one hike in 2019 and definitely not before the second half Central banks raise interest rates when the economy is strong Canadas prospects are mediocre at least until the trade wars subside and oil prices rise Wage growth remains lacklustre and personal consumption grew only 19 per cent in the third quarter the weakest since 2013 The household savings rate was 08 per cent near an historic low Monthly retail sales have been roughly flat since posting an outsized 21percent gain in May Hope for Canadas economy in 2019 rests with the countrys entrepreneurs and business leaders We expect to see quite a good improvement in investment Poloz said Hes been saying that for years but the story came true in 2018 despite the uncertainty created by the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement Theres reason to think that will continue NAFTA is sorted mostly The BOS which ranks among the central banks favourite indicators shows investment intentions over the next 12 months are depressed on the Prairies but solid everywhere else The Trudeau governments promise to cut taxes on new capital including intangibles such as intellectual property and to prune regulations should be good for animal spirits according to Michael McCain chief executive of Maple Leaf Foods Inc Basdeo of BlackRock acknowledged that the shift to a digital economy which is driving rapid investment in talent software and advanced technology such as artificial intelligence AI could offset the many negatives Bold companies will see the chaos as a chance to make money or get a jump on their rivals No doubt there is a level of concern Tasso Lagios managing partner at Richter LLP the Montrealbased provider of financial services for wealthy entrepreneurs said in an interview But I find my clients are moving quicker and quicker to take advantage of opportunities A lot of opportunities are being taken but always with a worry Things could go terribly wrong in 2019 Thats why so many equity investors are cashing out But executives are moving forward emboldened by high profits full order books and the need to retool their businesses

headquarters of Arm Holdings a chipdesign firm is expanding apace Its latest new building is long and flat with a faade adorned with a pattern of metal triangles These represent the nanometresized silicon fins found on the surface of modern transistors Once the office block is finished the firm hopes its unusual exterior will help inspire employees on their mission to dream up transcribe and sell designs for the omnipresent computers of the futureGet our daily newsletterUpgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editors PicksArms recipes for computer chipsit designs them but does not make any itselfare the most popular on the planet Since it was founded in 1990 its corporate customers have sold a whopping 130bn chips based on its designs In one sense the business is simple We do drawings of engines and we sell those drawings says Mike Muller one of Arms founders who is now its chief technology officerYet Mr Mullers drawings are anything but simple They are computer code which give Arms customers a blueprint for the construction of microprocessors informationprocessing machines so complex that firms are happy for Arm to shoulder the burden of their fundamental design Those clientsconsumerhardware giants such as Apple and Huawei chip companies such as Broadcom and Qualcommpay Arm oneoff licence fees to access the design code add to it what they will then pay royalties on every product they ship containing it Apples popular Aseries mobile processors for example are built in this wayThis model also gives Arm and its newish owner SoftBank a Japanese internet and telecoms conglomerate a way of peering into the future of tech Masayoshi Son SoftBanks founder has repeatedly called the firm his crystal ballArms model boasts both high margins and rapid growth between 2008 and 2017 the number of Armprocessor based chips sold globally notched up a compound annual growth rate of 21 Even so few owners of phones televisions watches voice assistants and other devices have heard of Arm despite the fact that their gizmos are stuffed with its intellectual propertyAfter years spent building a dominant position in the smartphone market Arm has its sights on new territory SoftBank which took Arm private in 2016 for 243bn 32bn has instructed the company to lower its profits to around zero and instead reinvest in order to expand into other technology markets The deal was the largest acquisition that Mr Son has made and also one of his priciest at a 43 premium to Arms market valueMr Son has boasted that Arm could become more valuable than Google by selling intellectual property IP into a world in which there could be as many as 1000 internetconnected devicesfrom smart traffic sensors to utility meters to personal health trackers and so onfor every person on Earth His switch to a focus on revenue growth not profit is well under way In 2015 Arm raked in a profit of 539m on revenues a shade above 1bn in 2017 profits were down to 325m on revenues of 13bnMoney ploughed back into the firm has mainly gone into hiring staff Arm has brought in 1800 people in the two years since the acquisition increasing its headcount by half when your products are intangible brainpower is the primary ingredient required to make more Arm estimates that designing an advanced central processing unit from scratch takes it 300 manyears SoftBank also signed legal contracts promising to increase headcount in Cambridge as part of winning permission to buy Britains biggest tech companyArm is betting that more and more of the processors it licenses in the coming years will be destined for cars a market in which it presently has a share of 20 see chart It got its start in 1996 as incar electronics grew unwieldy Car manufacturers started asking for multiple control circuits to be bundled into one chip in order to save space and eliminate weight and complexity Arm designed a processor which did just that As a result the vast majority of cars sold globally already have at least some Arm IP in them managing things like electric windows or dashboard displaysThe promise of selfdriving cars is pushing the automotive industry to pack more technology into its vehicles more rapidly than ever before While fully autonomous cars will not be widespread for at least a decade pursuing the dream is fuelling high investment in automotive computation designed to handle an array of tasks less redolent of science fiction Chips are needed to handle automated driverassistance features such as lanekeeping that are becoming standard on new cars for example Incar screens which display information and entertainment will become more common and require information processing electric drivetrains require computation to manage battery levels and optimise their performance This is the most change that cars have seen since the advent of microcontrollers in the late 70s early 80s says Lakshmi Mandyam who runs Arms automotive businessWhen autonomous cars do arrive in the mass market Arm anticipates a payday It estimates that they will require ten times more computational power than an advanced smartphone does meaning the market could give Arm the possibility of collecting ten times the royalties for each autonomous car that is built using its IP While there will always be fewer vehicles on the roads than smartphones in pockets the extra silicon required means that Arm estimates that cars will become as big a market as phones which account for 60 of its annual revenuesAnother promising area is network equipment the connective tissue of the internet As the cost of storing and processing data has plummeted over the past two decades the cost of managing all the resulting traffic has rocketed Arm is betting that the world will need more machines that are designed to shuttle data around efficiently and to keep networks secure as they do so The companys share of the infrastructure market has increased from 5 in 2011 to 20Where Arm is weakest is in data centres a market that is practically owned by Intel which fabricates chips as well as designing them It has a less than 1 share and wants to catch up In November Amazon announced that it had built a new custom chip for its data centres using Arms server IP a useful handhold in the market The handful of gigantic firms that dominate cloud computing like the idea of designing their own custom hardware based on Arm licences because it allows them to buy fewer expensive package deals from IntelA hitch in Arms plans could be that opensource processor designs which are free of charge for any business to use become a viable alternative to its own A family of such designs called RISCV are starting to show promise Widespread adoption would spell trouble for Arm Other problems could emerge if Mr Sons plans succeed and Arm IP becomes an essential component for the vast majority of computation everywhere This might tempt the firm to raise its prices prompting a backlash from customersThe more cash Mr Son pumps into Arm the higher the stakes Its revenues are far from Mr Sons hopes of Googlelike heightsthe search giants top line is a hundred times the size of Arms SoftBank has hinted that it might relist Arm after ramping up its ideas factory That would presumably generate a return for Mr Sons 93bn Vision Fund an investment vehicle through which he is pumping cash into an array of frontier technologies SoftBank has almost finished transferring a quarter of Arms shares into the fundBeyond its own profitability Arm has another attraction for Mr Sonits ability to help prophesy techs future Arm typically takes eight years for a new design to go from idea to machine code that can be shipped to licencees To keep its design pipeline full of viable new ideas the firm must constantly forecast the computer industrys direction To do so it uses its close ongoing relationships with big customers It is in constant discussion with firms that make cars televisions fitness trackers drones and other products As well as Apple one of its biggest clients it talks to creditcard companies such as MasterCard as well as to content distribution networks like Netflix and Disney All are anticipating their computing requirements many years hence and need Arms help to build themThis has turned Arm into a sort of information clearinghouse for future computing applicationshence Mr Sons crystalball analogy True it cannot give SoftBank or his Vision Fund specific investment advice or proprietary information But Arm can and does tell Mr Son about the interesting new postcodes of the future ones that might warrant investmentSome of those new areas are especially eyecatching Eric Hennenhoefer who runs Arms research division in Cambridge says that the firm is working on designs for chips which can harvest the energy they need to run from the environment around them instead of requiring some builtin power source Why When his team looked into the subject they worked out that there is not enough lithium on the planet to build batteries for the trillions of computers with which Mr Son expects to paint the world in the coming decadesSo if his vision is to come to pass many processors would have to get by without batteries This might be done by harvesting energy from motion or from lowlevel background radiation concepts that for now exist only in academic circles Inside their new building gazing out at green hills from nooks designed to aid contemplation Arm employees are already attempting to design themThis article appeared in theBusinesssection of

for migrants tussled with the Trump administration as it moved to tighten the southern border to illegal immigrants Among the administration moves at least temporarily blocked by judges the ending of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for young immigrants the cancellation of temporary protected status for immigrants from some Central American countries and Haiti and blocking access to the asylum system for immigrants apprehended crossing the border illegally Mr Trump himself reversed his most controversial enforcement policy separating parents and children caught crossing the border illegally More than 2500 children had been separated Many but not all have since been reunified The president did win one significant victory The Supreme Court ruled in June that the third iteration of his ban on travel from certain Muslimmajority countries could be enacted The makeup of immigrants arriving in the US continued to evolve this year away from individuals seeking work and toward families seeking asylum Many fled violenceracked countries in Central America including El Salvador Honduras and Guatemala A record 107000 immigrants traveling as families were apprehended after crossing the US border illegally in the federal fiscal year that ended in September But the overall number of illegal border crossers arrested roughly 396000remains well below the peak of more than 16 million people arrested in 2000 More recently multiple caravans involving thousands of Central American migrants made their way to the border The president denounced the caravaners as an invasion and sent some 5000 troops to help reinforce border security primarily by laying razor wire The mass arrivals combined with the administrations tactics created lengthy waits to enter the US to seek asylum as well as a highprofile attempt by hundreds to cross the TijuanaSan Diego border that resulted in Border Patrol agents shooting tear gas Last week President Trump threatened to let the federal government shut down if Congress fails to fund his border wall as part of negotiations over a yearend spending bill Alicia Caldwell Trump Campaign Figures Aid Mueller Probe Special counsel Robert Muellers investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential electionand whether President Trump or his associates played a role in itentered its second year with new charges and guilty pleas Mr Mueller set his sights on some of Mr Trumps closest advisers among more than two dozen individuals including his former longtime lawyer Michael Cohen and former campaign adviser Paul Manafort as he moved closer to wrapping up the probe The investigation which some Republicans see as politically motivated charged 25 Russian citizens and three Russian companies in two separate cases Mr Mueller filed court documents that detailed an alleged conspiracy by Moscow to interfere in US politics by stealing emails and unleashing a social media campaign aimed at inflaming tensions in American society The special counsel obtained a guilty verdict against Mr Manafort on charges of tax fraud and other financial wrongdoing In a separate case he won a guilty plea and a cooperation deal from Mr Manafort though prosecutors later said Mr Manafort had reneged on the deal by lying to them In addition Mr Mueller charged Mr Cohen for years one of the presidents closest confidantes with lying to Congress about Mr Trumps business dealings in Russia That came on top of other federal charges Mr Cohen faced involving campaign finance and taxfraud allegations he pleaded guilty to eight charges and last week received a threeyear prison sentence The charges were based in part on payments the lawyer made to silence women who accused the president of having sexual encounters with them including former adult film actress Stormy Daniels Mr Cohen helped Mr Muellers team after pleading guilty The special counsels team also revealed new details about the extent of former national security adviser Mike Flynns cooperationdetailing 19 meetings to assist in three separate inquires The office continues to investigate Roger Stone another close friend of Mr Trump for his contacts with the antisecrecy website WikiLeaks The site published hacked and stolen Democratic emails during the 2016 campaign Mr Trump for his part gave Mr Mueller written answers to questions in November after months of wrangling over the terms of the questioning The presidents complaints about Mr Mueller grew increasingly bellicose over the year as he accused Mr Mueller of being out of control and pressuring witnesses to lie Byron Tau Kavanaugh Drama Riveted Public President Trump had the chance to forge the most conservative Supreme Court majority in decades with the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy in July He chose Brett Kavanaugh a judge admired by conservatives and a veteran of the George W Bush White House and Kenneth Starrs independent counsel team that investigated President Bill Clinton The pick prompted an outcry from liberals who mounted a vocal opposition campaign And that was before Dr Christine Blasey Ford a California professor came forward to allege the nominee sexually assaulted her when the two were teenagers charges he denied The allegations set the MeToo movement on a collision course with the battle over the direction of the high court creating a new level of acrimony in the confirmation process Congressional testimony by Justice Kavanaugh and Dr Ford riveted the nation recalling the Clarence ThomasAnita Hill drama of 1991 In October the Senate approved Justice Kavanaugh on the slimmest vote for a confirmed Supreme Court nominee in modern times Brent Kendall Shooting Forged Teen Activists Teenagers became the new faces of the guncontrol

Rise but Feds Path Is Less Clear The Federal Reserve is set to cap a year of rising rates by boosting its shortterm benchmark level on Dec 19 in what would be its fourth increase for 2018 But it has indicated greater uncertainty over the pace of increases next year The most recent rise in September lifted the benchmark to a range of between 2 and 225 A year ago Fed officials penciled in three increases this year but projections of stronger growth due to tax cuts and a federal spending deal in February prompted an extra rise Yet recently officials indicated they may take a more waitandsee approach to future boosts basing them on the economys response to past rises Meantime the Fed saw a leadership transition Jerome Powell succeeded Janet Yellen a Barack Obama appointee as chairman in February Richard Clarida joined the central bank as vice chairman in September And John Williams moved from president of the San Francisco Fed in June to run the New York Fed one of the central banks

overtime,https://www.ft.com/content/feeb9330-02be-11e9-99df-6183d3002ee1,2018-12-18 17:27:49,Balazs was one of the thousands of Hungarians who trampled across snow into an industrial suburb of Budapest on Monday for a fifth night of protest against prime minister Viktor Orban Every day in Hungary is crazier than the next said the 40yearold who carried an EU flag One day the government tried to dismantle the media next the courts then education then the homeless law and so on he said referring to a spate of recent laws tightening Mr Orbans control It keeps getting worse and worse The immediate target for Balazs and other protesters was the headquarters of state broadcaster MTVA where opposition MPs had staged an overnight sitin to try to get their demands read on air But the catalyst was last weeks approval of a labour law to allow Hungarys employers to demand more hours from their workers Dubbed by critics as a slave law it has united Hungarys weakened and usually divided opposition against Mr Orban the countrys powerful and authoritarian premier and his governments grip on the judiciary the media and education MPs from across Hungarys political spectrum spoke at Mondays protest Demonstrators waved flags representing movements as disparate as the ethnic Roma and the formerly farright Jobbik party which in 2014 waged campaigns using antiRoma rhetoric Supporters say that though the crowds are modest the union of disparate forces is a new factor that could allow them to mount more of a challenge to Mr Orban who won a commanding electoral victory in April and his Fidesz party Times are changing said Agnes Vadai an MP from the Democratic Coalition at a press conference on Tuesday with other opposition MPs We still have huge ideological differences on certain political issues but what matters is that we understood that the people want us to find a solution for the country In Aprils elections parties other than Fidesz received almost half of the votes but election law and constitutional amendments in 2011 meant Fidesz won a twothirds majority in parliament This kind of unity is what Mr Orban fears the most said MP Timea Szabo of Dialogue for Hungary He has been so strong before because we were divided The law approved last week allows employers in Hungary to request up to 400 overtime hours from employees Hungary is trying to cope with a severe labour shortage as it seeks to woo international investors such as BMW which announced a 1bn investment this summer in the western city of Debrecen Almost 30 per cent of Hungarys industrial output is in the automotive industry much of it from German companies Trade unions student groups and antiOrban parties have said that if President Janos Ader signs the slave law as expected by the December 22 deadline they will organise a general strike Opposition groups began to unite in the lead up to the vote because they were largely denied the opportunity to debate the law The solidarity was cemented after violence by police and security personnel on Monday against at least four MPs one of whom was hospitalised The use of violence against opposition politicians is something quite new said Peter Kreko of the Budapestbased Political Capital research institute It just became quite evident that illiberalism has stepped up to a new level Csaba Toth executive director of the Budapestbased Republikon Institute thinktank said the protest was spurred by the muzzling of the opposition Mr Orban miscalculated he said Hungarys government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs dismissed the protests as a small minority of foreigntrained activists representatives of losing political parties and yes Soros network putschists making a reference to HungarianAmerican billionaire financier George Soros a frequent target of Mr Orban The governing alliance remains as popular as ever among Hungarian voters Mr Kovacs wrote on his blog The test for the opposition is whether its unity momentum and mood can be sustained through into next year and whether it will spread beyond Budapest Protests in a number of regional cities only drew hundreds of people The problem is that outside the capital the people are completely without independent media said Lujza another protester Miklos Szantho who runs the governmentfriendly Center for Fundamental Rights a conservative Budapestbased thinktank said the opposition would shoot themselves in the foot by turning the focus from the overtime law to stories about the unrest they caused which have dominated governmentfriendly media Many observers drew parallels with mass protests in 2006 which were triggered by a leaked recording of thenpremier Ferenc Gyurcsany in which he admitted his Socialist party had lied to win elections It took four years for the government to fall in an election that brought Mr Orban to power I think it is the beginning of the end of the Orban government but that end is very far away said Mr Toth Mr Szantho said if the opposition expected major changes they will just kid themselves As previous and much larger movements were not able to undermine the political power of the governing forces this one which is generated by a marginalised parliamentary opposition and a few thousand of their followers and disproportionately exaggerated by liberal media will leave the legitimacy of the Orbangovernment untouched he said

and cofounder has reached deep into Britains past In Wiltshire B4 Christ her sweatshirts Tshirts and homewares come adorned with images of Stonehenge and Avebury stone circles mysterious runic symbols and ancient pottery Its more esoteric than the usual streetwear fare and arrives thanks to a collaboration between Prantera and her old friend Jeremy Deller the Turner Prizewinning artist The pair cooked up the concept in 2017 when Deller was working on a project to mark 100 years since Stonehenge was gifted to the public If you go to Stonehenge you cant really buy interesting Tshirts says Prantera 47 Thats how the discussion started we thought we could do a few pieces for English HeritageDeller appeared at Pranteras Islington studio with a book of sketches inspired by Britains Neolithic past The pair developed those ideas into clothing merchandise and an exhibition featuring images shot by photographer David Sims at Stonehenge a superior location wangled for the campaign by DellerStonehenge could be the greatest logo or trademark in the whole world says Deller 52 The silhouette is so recognisable it probably has more recognition than almost anything in Britain short of the Queen Stonehenge is a brand isnt itAnd not just any brand but one with almost universal appeal beloved by artists and archaeologists musicians and mystics Right now it seems to be working a particular spell on designers who are escaping our grim present to reach back to a time of comforting rites and magical thinking Sarah Burton replicated rocks from Avebury for a springsummer 2019

saucer hovering over the stones with the slogan Stonehenge built by immigrants and makes other connections of its own Some Tshirts are tiedyed and one is splashed with a giant happy face with standing stones for eyes Its a mashup of Britains ancient history and the rave culture in which Prantera and Deller came of age at huge illegal allnighters in the late 1980s and early 1990sDeller fascinated by tribes and subcultures has just made Everybody in the Place An Incomplete History of Britain 19841992 a documentary about that time Rave was another way of getting people to get in touch with the landscape the land says Deller Most of the first raves happened outside cities and to get to one was a form of pilgrimage in a way And rave has this pagan preChristian feel to it which was again something that these sites haveWill the collection Make Archaeology Sexy Again as one tee proclaims Perhaps The Cerne Abbas giant the mighty clubwielding figure chalked into a Dorset hillside features on hoodies fleeces and crockery with a special emphasis on his 26fttall phallus It wasnt one of the original features in the design says Prantera I did keep thinking is this going to work commercially Its puerile but its got a power Sexy Archaeology Tshirt 70  Photography David Sims stylist Jane HowPranteras own label is replete with symbols a temple broken pillars pointing both to the designers Roman heritage her father is Italian and to the grandiose mythologies of brands such as Versace We communicate so much with signs at the moment like emojis she says Symbols are very direct and powerful as tools of communicationFor Deller whose art has an approachable democratic flavour in an earlier Stonehenge project he toured Britain with a lifesize inflatable model of the site upon which people were invited to bounce clothing is a longterm interest Last year he worked with Helmut Lang on a capsule collection of pink hoodies and in the 1990s he designed Tshirts for London store Sign of

just the random quality of someone buying something and then wearing it Theres something a little egalitarian about thatUp to a point Aries isnt cheap sweatshirts start at 170 Tshirts at 75 but Prantera is committed to highquality production As consumers were more and more detached from the manufacturing process she says Even as a producer you can just send a drawing out and something comes back you have no idea whos made it I disagree with that as a process We manufacture in Italy in small independently run laboratories We know all our producers and the process the garments go throughDude fleece hoodie 352 and Snow skirt 285  Photography David Sims stylist Jane HowPrantera has been in the streetwear game for three decades as a woman shes something of a rarity Streetwear is a world thats very closed to women she says I think thats something I never wanted to admit to myself But Ive got two kids a boy and a girl and Ive started to become more conscious of it Im quite a believer in tokenism these days because fashion can really change the way people look at thingsThe release of Wiltshire B4 Christ comes after a year of intense growth for Aries The brand was always intended to be unisex but because buyers and shows remain bifurcated into mens and womenswear that proved difficult to achieve in practice For a long time men werent buying the brand I think people understand the idea but they are set in their ways says Prantera Gender neutral clothing is quite a new concept There are some shops that go across mens and womens but very fewIt was only in 2017 that Prantera made a major pivot towards menswear buyers with striking results According Nicki Bidder who became Aries first chief executive two years ago the company saw 200 per cent growth last year Thats partly because we grew from a pretty small nonglobalised business into something that is now finding an international footing says Bidder But unlike a lot of luxury brands finding commercialisation in streetwear Aries is actually from the streetwear world There are only a few people that are deeply respected in streetwear and Sofias always been one of those peopleBoth Bidder and Prantera are wary of growing too fast hence their decision not to seek out investors Theres so much investment at the moment and its so much easier to get says Prantera The game is almost broken The challenge of building something yourself is much more rewarding Her label may not last 4000 years But Prantera is in it for the long haulDesigners from Aries Sofia Prantera to McQueens Sarah Burton have been beguiled by Britains stone circles But they are far from the only creatives to heed the call of the ancients A couple of years ago Megan Fox blockbusting star of Transformers and

Zhixing Zhang a senior analyst at consultancy Stratfor While such moves were also part of a broader trend of manufacturers seeking cheaper labour costs elsewhere in Asia the risk of unemployment in China will worry the Chinese leadership especially as the imposition of higher US tariffs threaten to quicken the pace of an exodusFor Beijing one of the key imperatives is to maintain social

administration.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-interior-secretary-to-leave-by-end-of-year-11544884389,2018-12-16 02:52:30,WASHINGTON Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke who has been the subject of more than a dozen government investigations will leave his position by the end of the year President Trump said Saturday adding to the list of top officials to exit from the administration Mr Trump announced Mr Zinkes departure via Twitter saying that the secretary has accomplished much during his tenure and I want to thank him for his service to our Nation He added that a new interior secretary would be named next week White House officials have long been concerned about the allegations against Mr Zinke according to one person who has been involved in the discussions In recent months it became apparent that he would be a target for Democratic oversight when the party assumes control of the House in the new year this person said Mr Zinke said Saturday that he chose to resign because he thought the many investigations of him would undermine the president and his administration I loved working for the president but after 30 years of public service I could not justify spending thousands of dollars defending false allegations Mr Zinke told The Wall Street Journal via text message It is better for the president and Interior to focus on accomplishments rather than fictitious allegations Mr Zinke has faced allegations of improper spending on private charter flights and questions about a development deal in his home state of Montana The Interior Departments internal watchdog has referred at least one probe to the Justice Department Mr Zinkes lawyer Steve Ryan has said that the interior secretary has done nothing wrong The Interior Departments inspector general last month cleared the secretary of wrongdoing in an investigation into whether he redrew the boundaries of a national monument in Utah to exclude lands owned by a political ally Mr Zinke in the conversation via text said that he decided in consultation with his family to leave the job and that President Trump had supported him in all the investigations Every vicious allegation that is investigated leads to the same conclusion no wrongdoing he said Ten straight investigations ranging from my wife riding in the same vehicle to the socks I wear Its sad when public service means risking bankruptcy defending false allegations I dont see it stopping under a new Congress Mr Zinke has aggressively responded to critics Last month Democratic Rep Ral Grijalva of Arizona the incoming chairman of the House committee that oversees the Interior Department said in an opinion piece in USA Today that Mr Zinke was unfit to lead the department and called on him to resign Mr Zinke responded by accusing Mr Grijalva of showing up to work drunk Mr Grijalva denied the claim and demanded an apology Rep Grijalva said he hoped for a better relationship with Mr Zinkes successor Secretary Zinkes successor has a chance to move on from an unfortunate Trump administration record of environmental mismanagement and decline Mr Grijalva said in a statement after the announcement Mr Zinke who was a Republican congressman before joining the administration has generally embraced traditional GOP positions when it comes to the environment opposing most of the regulations issued by the Interior Department during President Obamas tenure But he departs from his Republican colleagues in certain areas in particular by opposing legislative efforts to sell federal lands to states That position is shared by Mr Trump and embraced by the presidents oldest son Donald Trump Jr who had a pivotal role in selecting Mr Zinke Mr Zinke was confirmed in a 6831 vote in March 2017 becoming one of a few of Mr Trumps cabinet nominees to receive support from a significant number of Democratic senators who said they liked his stated commitment to conservation Since taking office Mr Zinke has been a vocal proponent of Mr Trumps energy dominance agenda frequently referencing it and trying to harness the Interior Departments oversight of federal lands to support it That stance angered wouldbe allies in the conservation community Mr Zinke has pushed forward on an effort to shrink lands the Obama administration had designated as national monuments opening them up for development He has also worked to accelerate the opening of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas drilling More recently his department announced it intends to reopen millions of acres of public lands to potential oil and gas drilling and increased grazing by reversing an Obamaera plan to protect the sage grouse under the Endangered Species Act In a letter to President Trump viewed by the Journal Mr Zinke said he would be stepping down effective Jan 2 and ticked off what he called an unprecedented list of accomplishments at the Interior Department including what he termed leading the revitalization of our nations domestic energy production He also said hunting and fishing opportunities had been expanded on his watch and burdensome regulations that hurt economic growth had been reduced But Mr Zinke told the president that the Interior Department has to do much more work especially on a backlog of needed maintenance in the national parks and that the continual focus on him would be too much of a distraction Mr Zinkes departure will leave it to his successor to complete many of his biggest policy changes Expanded drilling and the sage grouse decision along with rollbacks of rules for offshore drilling safety and methane controls are all still in various stages of review and are likely to face court challenges from environmental groups The Interior Department is responsible for energy leases on millions of acres of federal lands and waters around the US as well as for the maintenance and operation of the national parks Mr Zinkes departure will be one of several personnel changes in the administration as Mr Trump enters his third year in office On Friday Mr Trump announced that the director of the Office of Management and Budget Mick Mulvaney would assume the role of acting White House chief of staff taking the place of outgoing chief of staff John Kelly A number of other top White House officials are also expected to leave the administration According to the leftleaning Brookings Institution the turnover among senior staff is higher than any of Mr Trumps five predecessors More than a dozen seniorranking White House advisers and cabinet members have departed since Mr Trump took office There has been more than one personnel change for at least four top positions chief of staff deputy chief of staff national security adviser and deputy

murkier,https://www.ft.com/content/6b0833c6-020f-11e9-99df-6183d3002ee1,2018-12-17 17:17:30,Americas expansion is more than robust enough to merit another quarterpoint increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday But with global markets on shaky ground and growth slowing in Europe and Asia the outlook for 2019 is murkier The Fed will announce its latest rates decision at 2pm Eastern time and Jay Powell the central banks chairman will discuss the reasoning at a press conference halfanhour later The meeting will be especially closely watched even by Fed standards given signs that the central bank is ready to slow the pace of rate rises in 2019 What will happen to rates The target range for the federal funds rate will probably be boosted for the fourth time this year and the ninth time since the Fed started increasing rates in 2015 taking it to 22525 per cent The steady reduction in the size of the Feds balance sheet will probably continue There has been some speculation that recent market turmoil could prompt the Fed to shelve the December move but that remains unlikely The US economy is expanding at a brisk 35 per cent annualised pace unemployment remains at its lowest levels since the 1960s at 37 per cent and wage growth is accelerating Suddenly dropping plans for a quarterpoint increase could send a panicky signal to markets However the overall message from the meeting is likely to point to a more cautious Fed in 2019 in part because interest rates are getting closer to neutral settings that neither stimulate the economy nor hold it back Core inflation has also remained tepid at 18 per cent lessening the pressure for more rate rises What will the Feds statement contain The Fed will probably give a sanguine assessment of US economic performance which has remained broadly resilient even as overseas economies including Germany and Japan dip into negative growth However the statement may indicate a less predictable policy outlook next year The Fed has now sent multiple signals suggesting it wants to get away from offering detailed policy guidance in its statement and shift to a more improvisational phase where it is reacting to incoming economic data Part of this new data dependent mode is a change to the language in the Feds postmeeting statement that could happen as soon as Wednesday Throughout 2018 the central bank been telling traders that it expects further gradual increases in rates but it may drop that steer as soon as this weeks meeting This would tell traders that the period of reliable quarterly rate rises is at an end and it could suggest a pause is possible early next year Exactly what replaces the wording remains to be seen but the possible amendment reflects in part the fact that after a procession of increases rates are edging towards neutral territory leaving it less obvious what comes next What will the Feds forecasts show The Feds dotplot of officials rates forecasts the subject of endless fascination on Wall Street will be particularly marketsensitive this time around The central banks median forecast in September was for another three quarterpoint rate rises in 2019 But the markets are not even fully pricing in one single move next year Many analysts are expecting the median 2019 rates prediction to be trimmed perhaps to two increases from three Part of the reason is the recent selloff in markets which has tightened overall financial conditions This may prompt a slightly softer set of growth forecasts even if the overall economic outlook remains benign with abovetrend growth and inflation remaining near the Feds 2 per cent target Among the other key factors to watch are Fed forecasts for the longerterm interest rate which stood at a median estimate of 3 per cent in September If this edges down it would be taken as a dovish signal suggesting rates are closer to neutral than previously thought What message will come from Mr Powell Jay Powell is likely to be questioned on his cautious tone  Reuters Mr Powell tacked in a dovish direction in a marketmoving speech in New York last month after an earlier interview in October gave markets the impression that the economy was strong enough to merit multiple aggressive rate increases The chairman is likely to be questioned on the reasons behind his more cautious tone in which he stressed there is no preset path for policy The key questions in traders minds will be how close the Fed is to ending its ratelifting cycle and whether a pause is possible in March 2019 Mr Powell may also be asked about the possible downside risks to the recovery These could include churning financial markets the danger of worsening trade tensions with China overindebted corporate borrowers weakening overseas growth fading fiscal stimulus and the economic drag from successive rate increases starting in December 2015 alongside the Feds balancesheet reduction programme Fed forecasts in September showed its interest

Berwick Maine started talking with a stranger about the stores demise Its such a shame she saidThe Wall Street Journal visited six closing Sears stores across four states over the past couple of weeks As workers reflected on their tenures some were sentimental and others fed up sick of reliving memories One worker in Natick Mass likened the multiweek goingoutofbusiness sale to attending a funeral daily In Waterford Conn Ahyvon Evans who has worked at the store for three months said many customers ask how much longer the store will remain open and how she will fare once it does shut its doorsAdding to the uncertainty Many employees said they dont know when their stores will close and they will be out of a job Mr Donofrio said he initially believed his store would shut its doors at the end of January a date that later shifted to Jan 16 Jan 13 and now Jan 6 Protecting the interests of Sears associates and all stakeholders has and will continue to be a priority for the management board and restructuring committee of Sears a Sears representative saidWhile the closing stores remain open they are busy At a multilevel Sears in Garden City NY a checkout line snaked halfway across one floor A nearby row of lighted artificial Christmas trees stood for sale marked down 50 In the basement appliances section salesman Ricardo F Pierre who has worked at the store for 20 years rarely stopped moving He opened stainlesssteel refrigerator doors pointing out features to customers and walking them through warranty options Fluent in four languages he answered questions from customers in English and Spanish Those who preferred an answer in French or Creole could have gotten it too Mr Pierre a 50yearold native of Haiti said he was heartbroken over the closing of the store a place where he learned to sell mattresses vacuums lawn mowers sporting goods and appliance warranties over his twodecade career Sears taught me how to sell how to become what I am today he saidMr Pierre typically works 35 to 40 hours a week at Sears and maintains another parttime job driving the elderly The store closing didnt surprise him traffic had been down for years But he doesnt know what he will do next He is considering applying at another retailer such as Lowes Cos orBest Buy Incbut might take some time off firstThis is a second home to me he said I feel this is the greatest business we have in America It should not be going downStores have been shrinking for years In New Hampshire Mr Donofrio estimated his location employed dozens of staffers five years ago today that number is closer to between 10 and 15 employees he said With sales commissions staffers at his store could earn 80000 a year selling mattresses and appliances But when traffic fell so did their compensation he added Management changes also stung Sears replaced its traditional employeediscount program with a pointsbased system tied to its loyalty program in 2017 a move Mr Donofrio likened to the company suggesting to employees Were going to turn you upside down and shake the change out of your pocketDozens of current and former Sears and Kmart workers wrote a letter to Searss chairman last month urging him and other Sears creditors to save as many jobs as possible and pay severance The approach followed that of laidoff Toys R Us Inc workers who persuaded former owners to establish a 20 million hardship fund This month as much as 253 million in bonuses were approved for top Sears executives and senior employeesThe word to describe how workers feel about the bonus plan is outrage said Lily Wang a deputy director for Organization United for Respects Rise Up Retail campaign which advocates for retail workers People are shocked and angryPlenty of employees are still searching for what comes after Sears In Nanuet NY breakroom conversations between workers frequently now center on the question What are you doing next as people say their goodbyes one worker said From New Hampshire to Ann Arbor Mich

industrial sites may look like an unlikely pioneer of clean technology Alongside its swaths of heavy industry the area once a thriving centre of iron and steel production is grappling with the decline of traditional sectors and has spent several decades on massive regeneration projects to transform derelict sites and tackle high unemployment and deprivation Now faced with the need to limit the emissions that have been a byproduct of its economy for generations new technologies are offering a lifeline as Teesside prepares to test the UKs first largescale carbon capture utilisation and storage projectBen Houchen Tees Valleys elected mayor said the UKs target of an 80 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2050 meant that industry had to act For places like Teesside it means there has to be a step change or business models are no longer viable he saidBen Houchen For places like Teesside it means there has to be a step change or business models are no longer viable  Ian McIntyreEvening GazettePrivate sector players including BP Royal Dutch Shell and Norways stateenergy company Equinor will collaborate with the government in a feasibility study for the Clean Gas Project in Teesside one of the worlds first commercial carbon capture utilisation and storage projects for a gasfired power plant It will serve as a testing ground for the commercialisation of the technologyThe scheme involves the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative an umbrella group of leading producers which was given 1bn in seed funding earlier this decade to find ways to mitigate climate change The plant will capture CO2 emissions at source and transport them by pipeline for storage under the southern North Sea The first phase of the project is likely to cost around 17bnThis project needs to deliver a degree of commercial viability to attract future investors But what we really want is a template for future projectsPratima Rangarajan OGCI Climate InvestmentsPratima Rangarajan head of OGCI Climate Investments said the initial outlay for the feasibility study was relatively small with planning work expected to cost tens of millions of dollars But this could quickly jump to hundreds of millions in the next stage and there are plans to attract more outside investmentThis project needs to deliver a degree of commercial viability to attract future investors But what we really want is a template for future projects Once you can replicate it you can really bring the costs down which will help get CCUS to commercial viability she saidThere is a growing consensus that carbon capture is an important tool for emissions reduction Without CCUS as part of the solution reaching our international climate goals is practically impossible Fatih Birol head of the International Energy Agency said at a summit in Edinburgh last month Energy minister Claire Perry is considering different financing options  Daniel LealOlivasAFPThe British government has committed 20m to innovation in carbon capture technology Claire Perry the energy and clean growth minister said several potential models of government financing could be used for CCUS schemes At the COP24 climate change summit in Katowice Poland this month she also pledged 170m towards creating the worlds first netzero carbon hub in the UK by 2040This will help to develop the technologies of the future to transform industry around the world ensuring the UK seizes the global economic opportunities of moving to greener cleaner industry she said Business leaders in Teesside have welcomed the pledge to develop the Clean Gas project The Teesside Collective a group representing industries based in the area including some of the UKs biggest carbonemitters has argued that investing in carbon capture could give the UK an edge in using CO2 to create new innovative technologies which could provide development and investment opportunities for the region after decades of painful industrial contraction in the areaPaul Booth chair of the Tees Valley Local Enterprise Partnership and former chairman of Sabic UK which has several petrochemical plants in the area said the project demonstrates the value of perseverance I dont think the UK has a choice I think the government has to support this kind of investment he saidThe former Redcar steel plant site would be used for the carbon capture utilisation and storage project  Gary StephensonAlamyThe proposed site for the CCUS plant is within the large swath of land formerly occupied by SSI UK the iron and steel producer that collapsed in 2015 and Tata Steel in the South Tees Development Corporations 4500 acre industrial area The demise of SSI wiped out 3000 jobs in the area and the new project is central to regeneration plansOwnership of the site is currently the subject of negotiations between the STDC and three Thai banks the creditors of SSI UK The banks are owed an estimated 800m and have a charge over the land But the STDC has warned that it could use a compulsory purchase order to acquire the land if a deal is not agreed soon My vision is for the Tees Valley to become the clean growth capital of the UK and we are in pole position to deliver on that said Mr Houchen We led the way for the industrial revolution and are now poised to lead the way in the clean energy revolution

Walt Disney in a highstakes auction to acquire Sky It was certainly emotional the Sky chief executive says becoming a little emotional himself at the memory The sale would end Mr Murdochs long association with the payTV company he founded in 1989 but Mr Darroch is sticking around with Comcast enlisting him and his management team to plot the next phase of its growth Comcast paid 30bn for Sky a price that makes it the most valuable UK company to be sold in the past 30 years Its sale also marks a turning point in UK media Mr Murdoch launched Sky to challenge the hegemony of UK broadcasting and the company initially had strictly domestic concerns its main competition being cable operators and freetoair rivals such as the BBC and ITV But the media industry has globalised with over the top streaming players such as Netflix and Amazon competing with Sky for viewer attention Sky is now part of a larger company adding its European operations in markets that include the UK Germany and Italy to Comcasts operations Comcast is the largest provider of cable television and broadband internet services in the US and also owns NBC Universal The priority for the combined business is to exploit what weve put together said Mr Darroch This would initially mean content tieups with NBC If you think of the US midterm elections Sky News would be using a lot of agency reporting NBC would have 300 people working on it and suddenly we have access to that There are other opportunities in sports coverage You can think of the Premier League the Ryder Cup in golf NFLthere are lots of ways to collaborate For example can we get their best NBC commentators to Sky for the London NFL gamesSky would also draw on Comcasts leading position in internet provision as it added broadband services in Italy We can now plug into the Comcast cable development team and cherrypick some of their best ideas and use it thereBenedict Cumberbatch stars in Patrick Melrose a Sky original productionBeyond greater collaboration an immediate goal is to get the debt levels down a bit Comcasts net debt increased to more than 100bn so it could finance the Sky purchase Mr Darroch is aware that a new era in media competition is about to begin Disney is working on a global directtoconsumer streaming service which will deliver content such as Marvel and Star Wars movies as well as television programming ATampT the new owner of Time Warner is also developing a streaming service which will include programming from HBOClaire Enders of Enders Analysis said any company hoping to launch a streaming service in Europe would have to talk to Sky and Comcast because of their scale and reach as distributors There isnt room for a successful subscription video ondemand service in any market unless it is on all the cable infrastructure she said in a nod to distribution deals Netflix has struck with Sky and others in the UK and Comcast in the US Mr Darroch appears to agree The idea that you can launch a streaming service and just put it out there and then for it to naturally scale is I think a real stretch You need retail operations to make that happen and weve got it all hereHe joined Sky as chief financial officer in 2004 working for then chief executive James Murdoch succeeding him in that role three years later I remember looking at Sky when I joined and it was a great business but it was rapidly running out of road It was in danger of losing its ambitionHe and Rupert Murdoch wanted to reset Sky as a growth business We seemed to be saying 7m customers was our ambition A target of 10m subscribers was set today the company is in 13m households in the UK a number that rises to 23m when its European operations are includedComcasts successful bid has also made Mr Darroch very wealthy He sold his holding of Sky shares for 134m on completion of the deal as well as shares that he received as part of an executive incentive plan for an additional 249m according to a stock market filingBrian Roberts Comcasts chief executive has promised to allow Mr Darroch to run Sky as he sees fit The relationship with Mr Murdoch has not been completely severed last week Comcast named Skys studio building after him during a ceremony at its headquarters in west London Mr Murdoch Mr Roberts and Mr Darroch then dined together that nightMr Murdoch is the antithesis of the shortterm view that Mr Darroch says is prevalent among UK institutional investors He likes risktakers When I first met him before I joined Sky I went to New York to have lunch with him He was in his early 70s then and all he wanted to talk about was where the world was going to be in 20 yearsKey moments for Darroch and SkyJeremy Darroch at Skys offices in central London  Anna GordonFT2004Jeremy

report life has gotten more difficult for the millions of people within the middle class We dispatched more than 50 people to discover why the American dream has been fading for far too manyIn this section we dissect the growing income gap by asking experts how we got hereand why What we learned Chasing the American dream was once exhilarating now its exhaustingThe Gig Economy Squeezes WorkersFor millions of Americans work brings income but none of the secondary benefitssuch as health insurance paid holidays or retirement contributionsassociated with employment Though many folks who forgo benefits do so by choice for the autonomy and flexibility and some are able to plan for retirement independently a recent McKinsey survey of 162 million nonpayroll workers in the US and Europe classified 23 million as reluctants who would prefer to be in the regular workforce 26 million more were characterized as financially strappedAppbased gig employers like Uber and TaskRabbit have helped drive the ratio of payroll workers to contract or freelance workers from 83 to one in 1997 to six to one today This arrangement often overlaps with hardship A 2018 study of California gigeconomy workers conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 48 struggled with poverty It also found that gig workers reported higher rates of abusive labor practices and racial discrimination than those who worked as employeesThere is also anecdotal evidence the gig economy is taking a punishing toll on workers In New York City eight cabbies have committed suicide in 2018 alonespurring some to highlight the fact that Uber and Lyft have driven down wagesAs the gig economy has expanded so too have initiatives to improve the labor conditions that go with it Most notably there are calls for a portable benefits regime that would oblige companies like Uber to make mandatory contributions to a health or 401k pool that would follow workers across different gig jobs There is support for such a regime in Congress notably a bipartisan bill from Senators Mark Warner DVa and Todd Young RInd but the initiative is currently stalled According to the Brookings Institution the best hope for workers is now with state and city governments including a Washington State proposal that would require companies that rely on workers taxed under 1099 status to make contributions to nonprofit benefit providers Still theres a long way to go before these gigs equate to jobs By Jeff John RobertsTim ChenCEO and Cofounder NerdWalletFor the 40 of Americans who dont have the cash reserves to cover a 400 emergency expense payday and other highcost loans may be the only options when they face an unexpected cost But these loans quickly drain pocketbooks as interest rates balloon

and return to the road of financial solvencyBecause Being Strapped is ExhaustingLinda Tirado caused a firestorm in 2013 after a blog post detailing her experience trying to make ends meet went viraland some conservative critics accused her of not being poor enough It led to the publication of her book Hand to Mouth Living in Bootstrap America which details the contradictions that many Americans bouncing back and forth between technically poor and barely middle class are facing You can go to private school and end up not making enough to live on You can be married to a veteran and not be able to afford dental care You can work 16 hours a day and struggle to keep the lights on We asked Tirado what three things she wishes people better understood about this increasingly common existence Lowwage work is Chronically Stressful People can very easily imagine having to stand 20 hours in a row one day But they cant imagine what its like to be on day 14 of that or then to get a oneday break and go back to another 16 days The cumulative impact is that youre more and more exhausted as time goes onIts Expensive If youre buying a roll of toilet paper for 99 youre paying an insanely inflated price But upfront you only have to pay 99 Now if youve got 50 and you can go to Target and get a multipack youre buying it at 19 a roll And that same economy of scale applies to everything elseIt Defies Labels Theres this genteel poor that were seeing more and more of This middleclass poor where they dont have 400 in the bank for emergencies But they do have access to 50000 on a credit card so theyre keeping up appearances and they wouldnt think of themselves as poor By Lisa Marie SegarraOur Neighborhoods Are Failing UsDying business corridors hurt the middle classThe South Shore neighborhood boasts a lakeside park with commanding views of Chicagos skyline Its only a 25minute commute by train from the downtown Loop the kind of short hop that young professionals crave It features stately brick homes that sell for 500000 and up magnets for academics and doctorsWhat South Shore doesnt have however is a supermarket It hasnt had one since 2013 when grocery giant Safeway shuttered its Dominicks subsidiary and closed all its stores More than five years later the hulking storefront at Jeffery Plaza that neighbors still call the Dominicks remains vacant For many residents its emptiness is a dual affront Its a symbol of the hollowingout of the local middle class and an obstacle to working people struggling to get aheadThis has always been a first house neighborhood says Carlo Rotella a Boston College professor and South Shore native whose history of the area The World Is Always Coming to an End will be published in April Its orderly brick bungalows were financial cornerstones for thousands of middleincome familiesincluding those of Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison and Michelle Obama But Rotella estimates that 3000 South Shore residents lost factory jobs in the 1960s and 1970s And more recently the Great Recession hammered the areas teachers managers and service workers leaving many upsidedown on their mortgagesAs families left town or slipped down the economic ladder household income in South Shore dropped among residents with jobs incomes now sit about 40 below the national average according to Census data That helps explain why the Jeffery Plaza location is the only one of 11 former Dominicks in Chicago that hasnt been acquired and reopened by another grocery chain Not coincidentally South Shore residents travel an average of 29 miles to buy groceries a greater distance than residents of any other Chicago neighborhood according to research by the JPMorgan Chase InstituteThats a modest inconvenience for upperincome professionals But its been the biggest disruption to our middleclass and working families and our poor families says Val Free lead steward of the Neighborhood Network Alliance a community activism

to what economists refer to as occupational segregation Meanwhile women are overrepresented in other middleskill industries that dont require a degree such as health care and eldercare and that provide less security and fewer opportunities for fulltime work The Institute for Womens Policy Research reports that in 2016 women represented 83 of workers in middleskill jobs paying less than 30000 a yearbut only 36 of workers in occupations requiring similar levels of training and paying at least 35000 a year Experts say societal bias plays a part in this type of job segregation but a study

seek opportunities in urban areas they confront steep housing costs Some price tags are extreme The median home in San Francisco or New York City costs more than 1 million according to Zillow But data show the problem is hardly limited to major metros If you want to bring prices down you have to increase the supply says Eric Sussman senior lecturer at the Ziman Center for Real Estate at the University of California Los Angeles The solution has to be a relaxation of regulations and building codesLook no further than Minneapolis for an example of such progress To combat rising costs the city announced a plan in December to end singlefamily home zoning and allow threefamily homes in residential areas Whatever the path experts agree Change is needed By Danielle AbrilA Credit CrunchIn November the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that total household debt in the US had risen to a record 1351 trillion in the third quarter of 2018 It was the 17th consecutive quarter in which that number had increased and it meant that the total debt burden on American households was now 837 billion above its previous peak exactly 10 years earlierin the third quarter of 2008 when the global financial system was on the brink of collapseConsumer debt has become as big a burden as ever The Fed pegged total US credit card debt at 844 billion at the end of the third quarter other studies have placed it even higher Americans began the year with more than 1 trillion in outstanding credit card debt which broke all previous records according to WalletHub anaylst Jill Gonzalez Although consumer confidence is high wage growth is not And yet were overextending ourselves anywayConsumer debt isnt an entirely bad thing Consumer spending represents more than twothirds of the national economy according to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis But rising levels of credit card debt also reflect some unsavory realities about the finances of the average American The amounts that people are paying on a monthly basis in terms of debt are really striking said Emily Holbrook director of planning at Northwestern Mutual The firms 2018 Planning amp Progress Study shows that Americans are now allocating virtually the same percentage of their monthly income toward debt repayment 36 as they are for discretionary expenses such as dining clothing and leisure 37What happened According to Emory Nelms a senior behavioral researcher at the Common Cents Lab at Duke Universitys Center for Advanced Hindsight changes in the way that we use and think about money in the last 30 to 40 years have led to a world in which were living with much more consumer debt New digital payment methods for example have made it easier than ever to spend money without having to incur the psychological payment pain that comes with spending physical cash The easier and faster it is to spend the less encumbered our spending decisions are he saysJust as the last recession forced Americans to pump the brakes on spending another downturn would likely prompt people to think twice before swiping their cards or tapping pay But the consequences could be devastating Economic changes could leave people in worse financial standing with less means to pay off debt and less credit available from banks Nelms says And that will restrict peoples ability to make things work By Rey MashayekhiAnd

Gulf and a possible new dawn for Africa",https://propertylistings.ft.com/propertynews/united-kingdom/5613-prime-property-predictions-2019-europe-the-middle-east-and-africa.html,2019-01-01 00:12:34,London where Brexit has been pricing itself in since 2016By Nathan BrookerIn the second of our series of property predictions for 2019 we look at Europe the Middle East and AfricaThe picture in the UK has been dominated by Brexit and most of our coverage this year reflects that When or perhaps if Brexit happens on March 29 my feeling is the market will not do a great deal In London Brexit has been pricing itself in since 2016 and supposing we dont go crashing out with no deal we may see a small Brexit bounce as those prospective buyers who have been waiting to see commit to a purchaseBut here is what the experts thinkGuy Bradshaw head of residential at Sothebys International Realty UKThe biggest driver for Londons prime property market in 2019 will undeniably be foreign investment by individuals looking to hedge their bets with the good currency play We are already speaking to a handful of American investors following the Bank of Englands BoE stress testWith the exchange rate potentially offering US buyers an effective 25 per cent discount on properties this could be one of the smartest times to invest in London These buyers are predominantly from Miami and New York and are unfazed by the proposed foreign buyer tax as they know they will recover these costs when the market bounces backThe UK market is looking like a good deal in 2019 to foreign buyers These clients remember purchasing here after the Lehman Brothers crash and have reaped the rewards of the market recovering in more recent years Crucially the BoEs report states that by the end of 2023 the economy is expected to resume growing so buyers now could be making a very savvy investment indeed if they are willing to hold on to their asset for a number of yearsHugo Thistlethwayte head of international residential SavillsAcross Europe buyer activity remains strong Germany continues to attract international investment particularly in Berlin and Frankfurt with new developments leading the way This is also the case in Rome which is starting to hit the radar with international buyers due to new development schemes coming to fruition newly built residential stock has not been seen in the city in the past decadeSpain is continuing its recovery especially in Madrid and Barcelona transaction levels in the latter are back to preindependence referendum levels Investors are now looking for value and I would tip Valencia as an alternative city to watchLooking to the Middle East Dubai is still the main destination for international investment Discussions of oversupply will remain into 2019 Residential projects will continue to be delivered adding to deteriorating demand and softening prices The property market at large will look for more government policy and growth initiatives development regulatory control and central bank lending policy to try and reignite demand drivers and curtail unfeasible projectsThe year ahead will bring further supply to the market for Abu Dhabi as key projects will be released to the market both for sales and leasing Al Raha Beach and Al Reem Island will continue to lead this trend offering tenants multiple optionsIn Egypt there is a huge amount of supply due to come to the market in 2019 but prices are likely to remain stable due to strong demand from a rapidly growing population and the fact that most purchases are in cash Other factors likely to support the current prices are high inflation and rapid increases in petrol prices leading to the rising cost of construction materialsThe current oversupply is also likely to prevent the major developers from launching new projects which will further support the current prices Two areas expected to see plenty of activity over the next couple of years include the New Capital to the east of Cairo and the area surrounding the newGrand Egyptian Museum in GizaLiam Bailey partner and global head of research Knight FrankThe eurozone has been a sweet spot in our prime global forecast for the last three years Paris Madrid and Berlin together lead our prime forecast for 2019 with 6 per cent growth forecast We expect these cities driven by buoyant economies expanding investment sectors and low interest rates to see domestic and international demand strengthen in 2019The consensus view is that the European Central Bank having confirmed it will end its assetbuying programme at the end of 2018 will start to raise interest rates in the third quarter of 2019 This will be the first rate rise for nine years across the eurozone and will mark the end of exceptionally cheap financeBased on buying trends witnessed this year we expect Berlin and Paris to see more inquiries from Middle Eastern purchasers while Madrid may see Venezuelans joined by Argentines French activity may wane after a high volume of transactions in Portugal and Spain in the past two yearsUnlike other prime markets globally the eurozone has yet to see foreign buyer taxes or rigorous transparency measures imposed Instead policymakers have focused on the holiday rental market and it is likely we will see platforms such as Airbnb face further restrictions in the regions prime holiday destinations in 2019In Dubai the easing of business and visa regulations alongside the removal of the banking sectors 20 per cent real estate exposure ratio is likely to underpin the market in 2019 when the majority of these initiatives will go livePrices will soften in those neighbourhoods set to see a large volume of new product delivered In contrast we expect prime prices in Palm Jumeirah Downtown Dubai and The Lakes to dip by only 24 per cent in 2019Sarah Vaulkhard adviser on the overseas desk at Property VisionMy advice for buying UK real estate in 2018 was to buy bestinclass assets and in an increasingly uncertain world this continues to be a sensible approachThe headlines paint a bleak picture of a weak UK property market and certainly at a high level London prime property values have come down since their 2014 highs However this certainly does not tell the whole storyAs I advised in my 2018 predictions good lateral apartments in wellmanaged buildings on the best streets are a sensible buy and have seen very little adjustment whereas dark basement apartments on busy roads may have come down 30 per cent So although a 1520 per cent fall is frequently quoted it gives a overgeneralised perspective on a market that is very fragmented and multifacetedRising political and economic uncertainty is feeding weaker sentiment across financial assets including real estate If there is anything positive to be taken from this it has helped to cap transaction levels which has reduced the hit on valuesNonetheless in this challenging environment we are seeing some good opportunities for those buyers looking to step into the market now For example our London team has seen more bank repossessions in the past 12 months than in the previous 12 years Why Mainly because homeowners have maximised their loans and the valuations no longer stand upThe appetite from overseas buyers for newbuild investment properties continues to fall and if UK prime minister Theresa Mays hint at introducing an additional stamp duty for nonUK taxpayers comes into fruition numbers could fall furtherHowever to counter that currency will continue to play a significant role As I predicted the pound did bounce back at the beginning of 2018 but this was shortlived and it continues to fall which will facilitate discounts for foreign buyers Many of the factors that make the UK an attractive place to invest and live continue to be true namely having a worldclass education system the appeal of English common law and the English languageHenry Pryor highend buying agentAbu Dhabis market has cooled as buyers bide their time With some exceptions this is the case in much of the overdeveloped luxury market in the Middle EastIn Africa there are signs of a new dawn with real estate proving popular in South Africa and regaining its allure even in markets such as Zimbabwe where speculators are starting to take positionsEurope remains attractive to a global audience the mix of sophistication economic stability relative personal safety and culture continue to draw buyers even while the UK appears to be turning its back on the rest of the worldEurope is cleaning up its act and has hung out the not welcome sign for criminals and money launderers and while there is still a lot to do there is some optimism that this will continue Investors looking for steady reliable yields remain keen on Europe but the speculators have headed elsewhereTop photograph Getty ImagesiStockphoto

has gutted the countrys economy Inflation has soared and output has fallen Factories and industrial zones have been reduced to rubble Threequarters of working age Syrians are either unemployed or inactive the World Bank said last yearBut roadside extortion is still booming The business has become an enduring feature of Syrias wartime economy with progovernment soldiers and militias as well as antiregime rebels exploiting insecurity to justify their checkpoints where bribetaking and kidnapping are rife The most lucrative onesoften taking advantage of the humanitarian need arising from a battle or siegeare sometimes referred to as millionaire checkpointsIts quite pervasive to the point that it becomes its own industry says Alex Simon Syria program director for Synaps a Beirutbased research firm that has tracked the social and economic impact of Syrias conflict A report from Synaps described the countrys economy as cannibalistic where impoverished segments of Syrian society increasingly survive by preying upon one anotherInternal borders that divide warring parties mean ordinary Syrians must cough up cash to navigate daily life even as the conflict begins to wind down The predatory practices also ratchet up the costs of goods that cross the country as the same checkpoints which extract bribes also impose internal tariffsBribes are factored into bus and taxi fares residents say As they pass through checkpoints experienced taxi and bus drivers will often reach out and pay the allotted amountsometimes cash sometimes a carton of cigarettesThe wars disruption to industry and the reduced incentive to work has weighed heavily on Syrias economy the World Bank said The bank estimates that during fighting from 2011 until the end of 2016 Syria shed an estimated 226 billion of its economic output A recovery could take decades it saidAs much of the fighting has subsided the Syrian government says it is trying to tackle various forms of corruption to spur any recoveryIn July the Syrian government cabinet approved a number of measures to curb corruption by individuals and establishments saying that nobody is above the law it added that no leniency would be shown in dealing with the problem now that the country was on the cusp of reconstruction according to Syrian state mediaThe Syrian government didnt respond to a request for commentResidents trying to flee fighting in northern Aleppo province earlier this year confronted demands for thousands of dollars to pay smugglers to cross regimecontrolled checkpoints according to Abdulrahman Ahmad who paid 1000000 Syrian pounds or nearly 2000 for himself and his wife The smugglers paid kickbacks to the Syrian soldiers he saidUnlike such millionaire checkpoints more modest operations have allowed some rebel outfits to pay salaries buy food and purchase weapons A rebel commander in northern Syria said his group and others have turned to checkpoints to make up for lost foreign fundingRoadside bribes arent the only means of wringing revenue from SyriansIn August Human Rights Watch released a report accusing the USbacked Kurdishled authority in northeast Syria of unlawfully restricting the movement of people living in internal displacement camps by confiscating IDs and preventing them from leaving the camps at will Some camp residents had to pay officials or smugglers to get out to access health care or reunite with their families according to the reportUnfortunately we have seen that people have tried to benefit from the extreme loss and suffering of Syrians said Lama Fakih deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch There has been no limit to the level of exploitationAn official at one of the camps mentioned in the report defended the policy for security reasons and insisted it was easy for residents to obtain passes renewed every 10 days to enter and leave He denied that people had to pay to get outAbductions also appear increasingly common Kidnapping victimsonce mostly the countrys wealthy businessmennow include aid and medical workers They are seen as key to a big payday given that humanitarian aid is one of the few sources of funding in some parts of the countryIn October the head of a large charity operating in Syria was kidnapped at a checkpoint according to the organizations security supervisor who didnt want his name or organization identified for fear it would make them more of a target The security supervisor said the kidnappers asked the man while he was blindfolded how much to ask in ransomHours later though the kidnappers released the charity organizations chief without a ransom being paid because of the local attention his case had drawn the security supervisor saidIn September Mr Ahmads brotherinlaw a father of four who works with the

in 2018 was health More than 74000 people went to work at hospitals homecare agencies and the like representing almost half the total number of jobs created last year according to Statistics Canadas latest monthly survey of the labour market Demographics anticipated the demand Since 2015 there have been more seniors aged 65 and older than boys and girls aged 15 and younger Anecdotal evidence of understaffed clinics and overworked mentalhealth counsellors is overwhelming And yet the supply of such workers appears to be adequate Annual increases in average hourly wages barely changed from September through the end of 2018 dragging down the average monthly change for the year to a mere 13 per cent Employers whether it be institutions clinics or oldsters seeking nurses to help them at home are feeling no pressure to offer higher wages to get the help they need The trend is similar in other industries if not quite as depressing Overall average hourly wages increased two per cent in December from a year earlier lifting the fivemonth trend to about 22 per cent So after several years of goodtogreat aggregate employment growth wages are only keeping pace with inflation Thats as odd as it is disappointing Before this year the jobless rate rarely fell below six per cent Now its the ceiling The unemployment rate was 56 per cent in November and December the lowest in data that dates to 1976 and it has brushed six per cent only twice since November 2017 With hiring at levels that economists associate with full employment youd expect stronger upward pressure on salaries But for whatever reason thats not happening The mystery should be enough to persuade the Bank of Canada to take an extended pause on its slow march to higher interest rates The central banks main concern at the moment is staying ahead of inflation and prices appear to be contained Steady hiring will keep the economy moving forward but until more of us get decent raises there is little reason to fear a sharp increase in demandWhile many measures would suggest that we have a tight labour market the signal from wages says otherwise Brian DePratto an economist at TorontoDominion Bank wrote in a research note Jan 4 Without this precondition it is difficult to see much in the way of fundamental upward pressure on Canadian inflation The December hiring data represent that last major variable that could influence the Bank of Canadas thinking ahead of its next interestrate announcement on Jan 9 Few if anyone expected Governor Stephen Poloz and his lieutenants on the Governing Council to raise the benchmark rate next week But there was a debate over how long they might wait and how many times they might lift borrowing costs in 2019 Economists at Bank of Nova Scotia think three increases are possible which would put the overnight target at 25 per cent within 12 months Aubrey Basdeo of BlackRock Inc told me in an interview before Christmas that economic conditions likely will allow only one increase this year and maybe none at all Canadas nearterm prospects depend on business investment and exports because evidence suggests that record levels of debt finally has slowed household spending  we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolvesFederal Reserve chair Jerome PowellBoth investment and exports showed signs of life in 2018 but the year didnt end well Oil prices dropped much more than the central bank was expecting and the loss of wealth will curb corporate spending plans President Donald Trumps trade war with China has thrown financial markets into disarray and is disrupting global commerce The future is too uncertain at the moment for higher interest rates With the muted inflation readings that weve seen we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves Jerome Powell the chairman of the US Federal Reserve said Jan 4 at an event in Atlanta Powell signalled a pause in his own campaign to raise interest rates even as a new report showed the US economy created more than 300000 jobs in December Expect something similar from Poloz even though StatCan figures show the Canadian economy added some 100000 positions in November and December a large total for Canada The job gains of the past few years should keep the Canadian economy out of the ditch and they provide a counterweight to the threat that all that debt could lead to financial crisis But the economy isnt as strong as it appears on the surface The youth participation rate an indicator that Poloz has said he watches closely dropped 19 percentage points over 2018 to 553 per cent according to StatCan That suggests employers dont yet feel pressured to hire marginal workers with relatively little experience Sluggish wage growth also implies slack in the labour market The Bank of Canada thinks hourly pay should be growing around three per cent given the strength of economic growth in recent years Salaries appeared to be heading in that direction then decelerated over the second half of 2018 Until that trend reverses the central bank has a good reason to leave interest rates alone Email kcarmichaelpostmediacom  Twitter CarmichaelKevin

atop Cerro Pachn in the Chilean Andes ponders the heavens Eyeless for now the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope LSST will from 2022 turn into the biggest digital camera on Earth Taking 3200 megapixel snaps with an exposure time of 15 seconds to capture an area 40 times the size of the full moon the LSST will map almost the entire southern hemisphere once every three or four nights for a decade The picture so generated will assess how matter in the form of stars and galaxies is distributed shedding light on the clash of forces that have brought the universe to its current state and thus scrying its futureGet our daily newsletterUpgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editors PicksThe LSST is one of a string of ground and spacebased experiments that will soon help physicists understand a celestial tugofwar One side of the contest gravity is described by Albert Einsteins general theory of relativity The attractive effects of gravity on matter thrown apart by the Big Bang would be expected to slow the universes expansion over the course of time In 1998 though astronomers discovered that the opposite was truethe universe is now expanding at a faster clip than beforeThat could be explained if gravity is opposed by an asyetunidentified invisible form of energy permeating space For this explanation to work the amount of such dark energy as it was dubbed by Michael Turner a cosmologist at the University of Chicago would have to increase as the universe expanded The extra energy would fuel cosmic expansion in much the same way that a balloon inflates if the air inside it is warmed What this energy might beor even whether it exists at allis moot The LSST and its brethren may be able to provide some clarityThe simplest version of the explanation is that the density of dark energy is the same everywhere in space and time As the expansion of the universe creates more space more dark energy is also created But not more matter and therefore not more gravity At some point in the past therefore the push caused by the growth of dark energy overcame the gravitational pull of all the cosmoss matter and the universes expansion began to accelerateHandily adding a single term known as the cosmological constant to the equations which describe general relativity extends that theory in a way which embraces this state of affairs On their own those equations do indeed suggest a universe that is either expanding or contracting The idea of a cosmological constanta force working in opposition to gravitywas dreamed up by Einstein as a way to reconcile relativity with the thenprevalent belief that the universe was actually static Observations made in the 1920s though showed that the equations prediction of a dynamic universe was correct and the cosmological constant was quietly droppedIn recent years however the constant has been revived Physicists have realised that it offers a solution to the darkenergy conundrum Even the unadorned equations of relativity do not predict that the universes expansion is accelerating But adding the constant and setting it to an appropriate value does give a solution that fits the observed expansionThe value in question is that every cubic metre of space holds by Einsteins famous equation of massenergy equivalence Emc2 about 1024 grams of dark energythe equivalent of a couple of protons This may not sound much but because dark energy occupies every corner of the universe it actually accounts for around 70 of the massenergy of the universe compared with the 5 contributed by what human beings think of as normal matter basically the stuff from which atoms are made The remaining 25 is dark matter a hypothetical substance that is detectable only by its gravitational effects and which has proved almost as elusive as dark energyThis theorising is all very well But it offers few hints about what dark energy might actually be One possibility is that it results from the interactions of the shortlived virtual particles which according to quantum physics constantly appear even in empty space The drawback is that calculations of the magnitude of this vacuum energy give a figure at least 1060 times greater than the expected value of the cosmological constantThe absurdity of this mismatch called the vacuum catastrophe or more candidly the worst theoretical prediction in the history of physics has led physicists to toy with other ideas One is quintessence which posits an allpervasive field sloshing around in space The energy of the field varies with time and in some models in space as well This property of variation distinguishes quintessence from vacuum energy and permits models of quintessence to be tuned to explain another riddle why the expansion of the universe began to accelerate late enough in its history to let matter coalesce into galaxies first Various flavours of quintessence theory exist with exotic names such as kessence and phantom energy depending on which physical parameters are tweakedA third approach to explaining the universes accelerating expansion is to fiddle with general relativity itself by changing the inversesquare law of gravity This law central to both Newtons and Einsteins descriptions of the force is that the gravitational attraction between two bodies is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them The required deviation from the inversesquare law would be small explaining why it has not been detected experimentally but would nevertheless be sufficient over cosmic distances to have the required effectThe details of such modifiedgravity theories differ Some versions from the arcane world of string theory a highly speculative attempt to create a theory of everything allow gravity to propagate in a fifth dimension additional to the four familiar dimensions of space and time In general however modifiedgravity theories require some sort of novel field that modifies gravitys effect In these models the source of the energy needed to produce the observed expansion of the universe is this modifying field rather than quintessence or the cosmological constantAstronomers whose careers are devoted to making observations tend to be sniffy about such highfalutin departures from wellunderstood physics as gravitymodifying fields and quintessence Many theorists though are similarly uncomfortable with the idea of solving the problem of the accelerating expansion simply by adding the cosmological constant to Einsteins equations Without knowledge of the nature of the spacefilling energy the constant represents they point out it is merely a fudge factor added to bring theory and observation into alignmentCamille Bonvin of the University of Geneva is one such uncomfortable theorist She calculates the predictions of many different theories and designs tests that would with the requisite astronomical observations permit her to rule in or rule out whole classes of different theoriesWhat has become increasingly clear in the past few years she says is that more precise measurements of the universes expansion rate alone are not enough to distinguish between the possibilities Astronomers must also collect more data on the largescale structure of the universe Modifiedgravity theories for example have different predictions about how matter will clump together than do theories which require no such modification By measuring the actual dispersion of matter visible as the fine tracery of stars and galaxies in the night sky it should be possible to distinguish between competing explanations Dr Bonvin and her fellow theorists are therefore hungry for data And the next two decades promise a delugeArmed with its mighty camera the LSST will produce the most detailed survey of the sky yet made This map will allow the darkenergy problem to be attacked in four different waysFirst the telescope is expected to discover about 1m type 1a supernovae 100 times more than the number known today These stellar explosions are one of a few cosmic yardsticks known as standard candles that are available to astronomers Twenty years ago they provided the first strong evidence of the universes accelerating expansionA type 1a supernova is a binary star in which a small dense object called a white dwarf pulls material from a larger companion Eventually the extra mass the dwarf has accreted triggers a runaway fusion reaction in its core resulting in a huge detonation Because this reaction occurs when the white dwarfs mass has reached 14 times that of the sun the intrinsic brightness of all type 1a supernovae is the same Comparing this intrinsic brightness with a supernovas brightness as perceived on Earth thus permits the distance to that outburst to be calculatedMoreover the velocities of lightemitting objects relative to Earth can be obtained from their redshift This is a measure of how much the wavelength of their light has been stretched and therefore made redder by the Doppler effect a consequence of the speed with which they are moving away from Earth as the universe expands As light from more distant supernovae must have begun its journey earlier the relationship between distance and velocity reveals how the universes expansion has changed over timeThe LSSTs second approach to measuring this expansion will be to use a phenomenon called baryon acoustic oscillations These oscillations are a feature of the early universe that can be discerned in the sky today They date from 380000 years after the Big Bangthe moment when matter then in the form of a hot soup of electrons protons and neutrons cooled sufficiently to form the first atoms That transition allowed light that had been bouncing around within the soup of particles to escape and the resulting flash has some 134bn years later been redshifted until it is in the microwave region of the spectrumThe consequence of all this is a phenomenon called the cosmic microwave background CMB which was detected in 1964 and was early evidence in favour of the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe Since its discovery the CMB and the tiny fluctuations of intensity within it have been measured with increasing accuracymost recently by Planck a space telescope launched in 2009 by the European Space Agency ESA Those fluctuations correspond to variations in the density of the soup at the moment the photons escaped These variations accentuated by gravity as matter cooled and coalesced are now reflected in the distribution of galaxies in the cosmosThe upshot is that galaxies are separated on average by a distance that was once related directly to the ancestral fluctuations in the CMB but which has increased as the universe has expanded Its value today is about 500m lightyears By measuring the averageseparation distance for galaxies near and far and therefore of different ages the farthest away being seen when they were youngest it is therefore possible to track that expansion over timeThe third approach available to those using the LSST to investigate accelerating cosmic expansion is called gravitational lensing This relies on the fact that as predicted by general relativity a massive body causes the fabric of spacetime to curve which deflects the path of light passing close by that body In the case of strong gravitational lensing an object such as a supernova or a type of exploding galaxy called a quasar located behind the lensing body usually a galaxy is bright enough and the lens is massive enough to cause a visible effect The light from the object behind the lens may be bent into arcs or rings or split to produce several images of that object see pictureRunning rings around dark energyStrong gravitational lenses are however rare Most of the time the effects of gravitational lensing are not so clearcut Such weak gravitational lensing can though be inferred by collecting data from many galaxies the LSST will study billions and measuring how their shapes are distorted on average by the effects of any intervening mass As lensing is sensitive to dark matter as well as the ordinary visible stuff this technique will let the LSST map the true structure of the universe in ways pertinent to choosing between explanations for accelerating cosmic expansionThe LSSTs fourth approach to the cosmicexpansion question will be through observations of clusters of galaxies By looking at closer and therefore younger clusters and comparing them with more distant older ones the telescope will permit physicists to study how these behemoths evolved As galaxy clusters are the largest bodies in the universe that are held together by gravity they provide a natural way to measure any departures from the behaviour predicted by general relativityPowerful though the LSST will be it has its limits The approach it employs is known technically as a photometric survey This involves recording only light that passes through one of a number of coloured filters six in the LSSTs case limiting the accuracy with which the redshifts of galaxies can be determined To back this up requires a spectroscopic survey which splits up unfiltered light into its component frequencies permitting redshifts to be measured across a bigger swathe of the spectrumAnother new instrument the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument DESI which is mounted on the Mayall telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona will do this on an unprecedented scale DESI will collect its first images in the autumn of 2019 and is expected to begin its fiveyear survey early the following year The 5000 optical fibres of which it is made can each be manipulated robotically Each can therefore be trained on a different astronomical target Light from the fibres is sent to one of ten identical spectrographs These are sensitive to wavelengths that include the visible spectrum and also a part of the infraredThe process will be programmed by choreographing the fibres to capture light from about 35m galaxies over the course of the survey DESIs predecessor the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey BOSS looked at a mere 15m Its 1000 fibre optic cables had to be plugged into holes by hand and rearranged several times every night The automation and improvements in instrumentation involved in DESI mean it will be able to do in 30 clear nights what BOSS took five years to achieveResults from BOSS using the redshifts of galaxies of two different ages 35bn years and 57bn years and of quasars 11bn years old so far suggest a rate of expansion in keeping to within a percentage point or so with the cosmologicalconstant hypothesis To rule out more exotic models however will require similar measurements from more times in the past This is what all the redshifts DESI measures should provideThe DESI survey will measure the universes expansion rate in 300myear increments from about 115bn years ago until today Astronomers will use these data to build a picture of how the universes largescale structurethe networks of galaxies that DESI will charthas changed That will reveal whether gravity is being modified in ways that are out of kilter with Einsteins theoriesResults from DESI and the LSST will be supplemented by Euclid a space telescope being built by ESA that should be launched in 2022 During a mission lasting more than six years Euclid will measure the weaklensing effects of 15bn galaxies and the redshifts of 25m galaxies up to 10bn lightyears away Without the fluctuations imparted by Earths atmosphere and other sources of noise that groundbased telescopes must contend with Euclids results should improve the accuracy of estimates of the universes expansion rate tenfoldFurther in the future will come the Square Kilometre Array SKA a huge radiotelescope project based in South Africa and Australia which has its headquarters at the Jodrell Bank Observatory in Britain As its name suggests the SKA will consist of thousands of dishes and small antennae that have a total collecting area of a square kilometre At each site these will be spread over tens of kilometres to take advantage of a technique called interferometry in which an array of dishes working together can simulate a single larger telescope with an aperture equivalent to the separation between the farthest members of the arraySKA1 the first phase of the project will include 200 dishes in South Africa and 130000 small antennae in Australia It should be ready by the mid2020s SKA2 will expand the network to create the largest scientific instrument on Earth but quibbles over the price tag may yet scupper the project If the money is found it might start work a decade or so after SKA1The SKA will address the question of the universes expansion by mapping the distribution of hydrogen atoms in the cosmos The distribution of hydrogen is expected to correspond to the distribution of matter of all kinds so mapping hydrogen is another approach to studying the universes structure The SKA will also search for the gravitational lensing of radio sources as opposed to the optical ones the LSST plans to look atWith all these data astronomers will open a window on the universes past That should improve predictions about its future The possibilities are grim In some versions of quintessence the energy in the quintessential field increases exponentially resulting in a Big Rip that tears apart atoms subatomic particles and eventually the fabric of spacetime itself In most projections though the end is more whimper than bang For anyone still around on Earth to look the universes accelerating expansion will mean distant stars and galaxies wink out one by one their light redshifted to invisibility to leave just a smattering of illumination from the Milky Way and its nearest neighbours the only beacons shining in a sea of darknessThis article appeared in theScience and technologysection of the print edition under the

the significance of the decision and its consequences Photo APWhile President Trump has defended his decision to withdraw from Syria about 2000 US troops the overwhelming majority of whom are in the northeast of the country details of the new plan still remain unclear They include how quickly that force will leave and how the withdrawal comports with another top administration objective rolling back Iranian influence in the Middle East Since its 2013 intervention in the Syrian civil war Iran has deepened its foothold in the country along with its allies the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and thousands of Shiite fighters that Tehran has recruited especially from Iraq and AfghanistanWatching Irans growing influence with concern Washington earlier this year formulated a diplomatic strategy on Syria that called for the removal of all Iraniancommanded forces from the country after Islamic State was defeatedWe are not going to leave as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders and that includes Iranian proxies and militias national security adviser John Bolton said in SeptemberThe White House asserts that its strategy is still intact because the US has other means to pressure Iran beyond keeping troops especially harsh economic sanctions reinstated after Mr Trump pulled the US out of the 2015 multinational nuclear deal with Tehran in MayWe will continue to use tools of national power including economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure as leverage to press for the withdrawal of Iranianbacked forces a White House official saidSome former officials assert that the administrations goal of getting Iraniancommanded forces to leave Syria was never realistic and that by removing American troops it will be avoiding other dangersIf we stay for sure our troops will be the target of Syrian government Iranian and ISIS operations that over time will strengthen Robert Ford the US ambassador to Syria from 2011 to 2014 said in an emailBut other experts say Mr Trumps pullout decision undermines the strategy his administration put in place earlier this year to weaken Irans roleThe antiIran component of the US strategy in Syria was based on a theory that by remaining on the ground backing a major military player and holding a third of Syrias territory and 70 of its oil resources wed be in a position to determine the shape of a political settlement said Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute a nonpartisan think tank None of that is at all possible if were no longer there with any leverage to speak of Mr Lister addedEven in northeastern Syria where the Turks are to replace US forces experts have questioned whether Turkish forces can fill the entire vacuum that would be created by the departure of American forces or would be willing to counter Iran with which it has important relations outside Syria Along with Russia the two constitute a diplomatic trio seeking to lead a political settlement to the Syrian warBut the disposition of the alTanf garrison in the south poses a special challenge The Assad government and Russia have long pressured the US to leave alTanf To keep hostile forces away from the base the US has established a 35mile deconfliction zone around the base which the Pentagon says has had the side benefit of deterring Iranian activities in this areaLast year the US shot down two armed Iranianmade drones that maneuvered near the area and bombed Iranianbacked fighters that ventured inside the zone In September the US military signaled its determination not to be pushed out by conducting a livefire exercise near the base involving more than 100 Marines Adding to the concern about relinquishing the base is the fate of the Rukban camp for about 50000 displaced Syrians that is within the deconfliction zone Aid deliveries from Damascus have often been delayed and the fate of the civilians who have taken refuge there is unclear if the American vacate alTanfIrans growing influence in southern Syria has

candidates have waited to gain more experience in Congress or in government and some have been intimidated by the millions of dollars needed to mount a credible campaignFor many aspiring candidates this year those risks have been reduced Advisers for Mr Sanders for example set a budget of 30 million in 2015 for his campaign but were uncertain initially if he could raise that amount The senator

Xiaoping flew to Japan in 1978 to seal a historic peace treaty between the two nations Mr Dengs trip featured a lowerkey but equally important visitto a stateoftheart plant owned byNippon Steel CorpThe Japanese steel mill was seen as the model for a manufacturing beachhead China wanted to build in Shanghai called Baosteel It was the linchpin of plans to transform Chinas agrarian economy into an industrial powerhouseBaosteels initial price tag was steep 6 billion equal to 36 times Chinas foreignexchange reserves at the time Mr Dengs response became national lore If we want to do this lets do it bigMr Deng who died in 1997 never got to see how big At the time of his visit to Japan China produced 4 of the worlds steel This year China is on track to produce more than half a record 923 million metric tons according to government estimates It overtook the US in steel production in 1993 sped past Japan in 1996 and last year produced three times as much steel as the US Russia and Japan combined Steel made its shipbuilding and automaking industries into the worlds largest In the US Chinas steel is used for everything from bridges and oil pipes to home appliances and cutleryChinas emergence as a steel powerhouse over four relentless decades driven by global demand and supported by government subsidies cheap loans and tax breaks helped the country become the worlds secondlargest economy from one of the poorest Its also one of the main drivers of trade tensions coursing through the global economyInvoking national security President Trump in March levied 25 tariffs on all steel imports The Commerce Department said this year that steel imports singling out Chinas were responsible for closing half the steelmaking furnaces in the US since 2001 and reducing steelindustry employment by 35Free markets globally are adversely affected by substantial chronic global excess steel production led by China the department said China is at the heart of the crisisUSChina trade tensions continue at a slow boil An agreement this month between Mr Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping signaled a temporary ceasefire while negotiations continueFor anyone wanting to understand how China became dominant in steel and the global repercussions of that transformation the story of Baosteel provides answers Renamed officially as China Baowu Steel Group Corp it is the worlds secondlargest steel producer trailing onlyArcelorMittal SA The companys sprawling complex sits at the mouth of the Yangtze River ringed by dusty highways and 10foothigh walls It has become a familiar target in Chinas yearslong clash with foreign competitors and regulators in Europe the US and at the World Trade OrganizationWithin months of the Japan visit Mr Deng became Chinas top leader and Baosteel broke ground with a balloonfestooned parade at Baoshanliterally treasure mountainan area seven times the size of Manhattan State media photos show a sea of helmeted workers surrounding a stage of officialsChina should eventually be able to develop a steel industry comparable in size to the steel industries of the US the Soviet Union and Japan the CIA forecast in 1979 in a report declassified decades later That turned out to be an underestimateAt first China capped its steel exports at 10 of Baosteels production seeking to guarantee domestic supplies China in the early 1980s did not plan to compete in international steel market anytime soon said ChaeJin Lee a historian who wrote about Baosteels early yearsThen China discovered how exports helped to accumulate hard currency and the export cap was lifted by the late 1990s The spread of stateowned mills to all 23 of Chinas provinces helped steel exports to now account for a quarter of the worldwide totalSoon after China bet its economic future on trade other countries leveled accusations of its dumping or selling products abroad at prices below production costs in products from detergent to solar panels to ironing boards A third of trade complaints against China since 2001 by the worlds largest economies the Group of 20 relate to dumping steel productsBy 2016 Chinas steel industry employed about five million That lifted workers from the brutal vagaries of farming to the security of stateowned mills that often provided free or subsidized housing hospitals and schoolsThe industry built shipping empires to ensure access to Australian coal and Brazilian iron ore used in steelmaking and tripled the size of the nations rail network between 1975 and 2017 to speed Chinas industrial boomChinas steelproduction surge drove down global prices a jawdropping 57 from 2011 to 2015 triggering tens of thousands of layoffs around the world Steelworkers in 2016 encircled the European Union headquarters in Brussels demanding action to curb Chinese dumpingAround that time during the US presidential campaign Mr Trump spoke out about imposing high tariffs on predatory Chinese steel importsBeijing said the US supported trade protectionism and that China was defending free marketsHelp at homeChinas steel mills were indistinguishable from the state for decades run by central planners and buoyed by free land cheap energy government capital and lowinterest loans For years the arrangement was of little interest outside the country That changed when China joined the WTO in 2001 and enjoyed sharply lower tariffs for its products Over the next five years Chinas net exports rose to 8 of gross domestic product from around 2 official data show Lowwage workers surged from farms to factories in Chinas industrialized citiesThe rich menu of subsidies helped Chinas steelmakers set prices 20 to 40 lower than the US analysts said US regulators made their first move against Chinese steel imports in 2006 An investigation found that Beijing provided subsidies on pipes of between 30 and 45 of the products valueChinas Commerce Ministry denied the charges and said it was a scapegoat of trade protectionism It didnt respond to a request for commentChina agreed when it joined the WTO to fully disclose subsidies It was required to report every two years the subsidies from both central and local governments Five years passed before China submitted its first report which included only centralgovernment subsidiesBeijing didnt provide an accounting of localgovernment subsidies until 2016 which the US delegation pointed out was 15 years late China has yet to provide the WTO with the full value of its subsidiesLast year China told the US delegation that it provides no subsidies for steel China reported this year that it had one steel subsidy in 2016 totaling 44 billion from the central government and 933000 from local officesPrivatesector analysts believe the subsidies are far larger likely in the hundreds of billions of dollars since 2000 according to Usha Haley a professor at Wichita State University who has studied Chinese steel subsidies Thousands of Chinese steel companies list the subsidies they receive from central and provincial governments as parts of their profitssometimes to the tune of 80 of profits Ms Haley said Chinas official data said revenue from mills totaled 56 trillion from 2001 through 2017China said in a WTO filing this year that it made a best effort to provide clarity on subsidies but the rules didnt clearly define localgovernment subsidiesIn 2016 US officials conducted a sixmonth probe in response to complaints from the American steel industry They concluded that China provided subsidies on corrosionresistant steel products including those made by Baosteel equal to about 40 of sales valueRegulators at the US International Trade Commission adjudicate such complaints They compute the impact based on interviews with affected companies and analyze such factors as global rawmaterial prices and freight rates It imposed tariffs on corrosionresistant steel products from 39 up to 241 The latest 25 tariff comes on top of theseBaosteel denied the accusations in a statement at the time saying its operations are based on market forcesFor now Chinas mill workers are more worried about layoffs than the impact of US tariffs They often gather to read about global industry developments posted on bulletin boards and bosses give briefingsBeijing facing depressed global prices and growing debt has forced the closure of smaller mills The government aided Baosteel by pushing a merger with its largest rival Wuhan Iron and Steel Group Co in 2016 nearly doubling Baosteels capacityBig steelBaosteel which exports to 40 countries provides steel to many of the Chinese companies that dominate the infrastructure of global commerce The mill is the biggest supplier to China International Marine

with his congregation Everyone Rev Dix says likes to sing a Christmas carol and is drawn to the Christmas essence the seasons optimistic spiritual messageBut this year his enthusiasm has an extra edge While many clergy in the capital will be celebrating in buildings dating back 100 or more years Rev Dix will be marking this Christmas in a new wood glass and concrete structure that was completed in October The premises are an illustration of how the Church of Englands diocese of London has seen attendance increase during the past 20 years bucking the wider trend of declining numbers across the rest of England Much of this growth is taking place in existing congregations or in church communities meeting in secular spaces such as schools but it has prompted the diocese to construct churches for the first time in 40 yearsRev Dix said his congregation had been nomadic for the past six years meeting in a community hall Now we have a home he saidBishop of London Sarah Mullally says a growing number of churches organise weekday activities such as parent and toddler groups  Yoi MokAFPSarah Mullally the Bishop of London said the growth was partly due to churches in the diocese starting to plant new congregations earlier than other areas In a plant a group of congregants from a large successful congregation leave to set up a new community or to revive a struggling oneShe added that the increased numbers also reflected how a growing number of churches were engaging with their communities by organising weekday activities such as parent and toddler groups and food banksUsual Sunday attendance at churches in the diocese which covers Greater London north of the Thames and west of the River Lea rose 66 per cent between 2002 and 2012 although it has fallen slightly in the past five years Across England attendance declined 21 per cent between 2002 and 2017 The diocese aims to start 100 worshipping communities by 2020 and is already halfway towards it targetWhat were doing is were listening to the changes in society Rev Mullally said Were engaging in new waysFavourable demographics have played a part in the dioceses growth The population is growing in many parts of London including the Isle of Dogs the peninsula where St Lukes sits The area including the original St Lukes church was heavily bombed in the second world war and its population plunged to only 9000 It has now recovered to its prewar level of 45000 The original St Lukes Church in Millwall east London  Antiqua Print GalleryAlamyMuch of London including the Isle of Dogs also has large populations of immigrants who tend to be more religiously observant than people with longer connections to the UKBut St Lukes also illustrates the influence of a handful of big evangelical congregations within the diocese Rev Dix arrived in Millwall with 20 other people from St Pauls in nearby Shadwell The congregation there had been revived by a plant associated with Holy Trinity Brompton the large affluent west London congregation that founded the Alpha Course an evangelistic programme that introduces the basics of Christianity and has boosted church membership around the worldThe newcomers had to adapt to working with the 15strong congregation that was still worshipping in the original churchs dilapidated church hall recounted Rev Dix They came from the churchs AngloCatholic tradition while the incomers were charismatic evangelicals Both sides have made concessionsSt Lukes has been boosted by a large immigrant population in the area  Anna GordonFTThats one of the gifts of churchplanting Rev Dix said It puts diversity together and says OK lets learn to love each other and understand each otherBut Paul Bickley a research fellow at Theos a thinktank on religion questioned whether the focus on reviving numbers in some congregations had led churches to neglect social action Lots of peopleare asking Hang on a minute is it purely a matter of getting more people in the room Mr Bickley said Are there other things that we should be paying attention toHowever St Lukes parishioners say the influx of the middleclass incomers had not changed the churchs focus on meeting the spiritual and practical needs of residents of the housing estate next to the new buildingAbi and James Tredgett from the London City Mission a Christian charity with baby Carys  Anna GordonFTJames Tredgett a worker from the London City Mission a Christian charity who has been a member of the congregation for two years said a majority of the 50 or 60 worshippers at a typical service lived on the estate where he lives with his wife Abigail and their baby daughterThere are some who travel in some that work in Canary Wharf said Mr Tredgett But the majority of them are local people who do migrants jobs whether driving or care or retailRev Dix insisted it was through building up relationships with those local residents rather than finding soundbites that would spread the gospel message that the church could

recently the station staff were divided into three workers from Network Rail which owns the station and employees of train operators Southern and Southeastern But now they work asTeam Victoria said Mr Williamspointing to a woman in a mauve jacket branded with the late queens headExecutives at all three organisations hope the partnership that extends from the station concourse to executives offices will not just ensure happier passengers but provide a template for the whole of the UKs rail network Given recent political industry and consumer pressure in the wake of last Mays timetable debacle and infrastructure overruns which have snarled up the network they may well be on the right trackVictoria station manager Darren Williams  Charlie BibbyFTSince privatisation began in 1994 the UKs rail network has been split between infrastructure now owned and run by Network Rail train operator and rollingstock owner Buttransport secretary Chris Grayling despite his memorable utterance this year that he did not run the railways has set out a contrarygoverning vision for the future of the network This involvesreunifying infrastructure and train operations in a given region with one chief executive running the track and the trainsThis challenges some of the fundamental assumptions of the UKs privatised network But there are already parts that are well advanced in such a scheme such as Victoria where for the past two years John Halsall of Network Rail and David Statham of Southeastern have been trying to bring track and train togetherJohn Halsall of Network Rail and David Statham of Southeastern at Victoria station  Charlie BibbyFTThe problem with the split said Mr Halsall who is managing director of Network Rails southeast region is that the railway is a huge machine with huge interdependencies and every component part has to work in sync if were going to deliver the service But the more you pull that machine apartthe less likely it is to deliverIt is not simply that parts are operating separately however they are often operating at odds The targets David is committed to dont necessarily align to my targets Mr Halsall said He cited train performance as an example where Southeastern wanted to run as many trains as possible but Network Rail needed to carry out infrastructure works which involve cancelling trains If those incentives are misaligned thats difficult for usThe new purple Team Victoria branding  Charlie BibbyFTTheir method for combating this involves closeness and communication perhaps mandated in contracts but achievable outside them too They spoke about setting common objectives around passenger experience and ontime arrivals bringing teams together under one leader with one set of data and one set of conclusions and mutually agreeable arrangements for access to infrastructure to balance service and repairsThis does seem obvious Mr Halsall conceded but it takes tremendous determination and strength of leadershipwhen the opportunity to disagree and fight arises to say were not doing that That temptation is incredibleThe UK is certainly heading towards a closer system said Mark Phillips chief executive of the Rail Safety and Standards Board an industry body Were rapidly advancing to a place where postBrexit we see the attraction of reintegrating track and train Andrew Haines chief executive of Network Rail told a parliamentary hearing in midDecember that the Victoria partnership was based on goodwill but added the Department for Transport was now formalising best practiceElaine Clark of the Rail Forum Midlands which represents 160 rail businesses said bringing track and train closer together was essential to ensure operators and Network Rail got the best out of the data both were generating but was better done on a regional basis If we try and do everything on a national level it doesnt work very well its so big you cant get hold of it or something in the system breaks downTalk of reunification summons the ghost of British Rail where track train and rolling stock were all one Mr Halsall did not buy this Even if you had one single organisation you still get fractures within that organisation if you have different objectives and aims The truth is that the tension weve talked about is an inevitable product of a quite complicated endtoend service What we need to look for is the common objectiveBut this partnership does not convince campaigners for full renationalisation who want track and train to be inseparable Ellie Harrison of Bring Back British Rail said she feared the reintroduction of profitmaking companies into the maintenance of the essential track infrastructure She pointed toRailtrack the company that first owned the privatised track but was stripped of it in 2002 after suffering serious financial difficultyThe real question behind unification is how to effect not just contractual but cultural change Southeasterns Mr Statham said The test of a good leader is if when you leave everything carries on in the first place If it all depends on David and me we havent done our jobs properlyThere are signs Team Victoria and the larger concept it represents is working

largest in about 2013",http://fortune.com/2018/12/18/america-china-number-one/,2018-12-18 11:38:11,What a difference two decades makes In 1997 Chinas gross domestic product was about 11 percent of the USs By 2017 it was up to 63 percent But this overstates the difference in living standards between the two countries since prices are generally lower in China In purchasingpowerparity terms Chinas economy became the worlds largest in about 2013 So which countrys economy is really bigger The truth probably lies somewhere between these two figures If China were to abolish its capital controls and open its currency to foreign speculation theres a good chance the yuan would rise in value bringing Chinas GDP at marketexchange rates closer to its PPP numbers In other words the economies of China and the US are now fairly evenly matched in size But with four times the US population China has more room to grow And China is already the worlds largest manufacturer and biggest exporter In other words if its not already the worlds dominant economic power China soon will be But what does this mean What are the implications of Chinese economic dominance for the world and for US policy The biggest effect will be that China becomes the leading beneficiary of what economists call agglomeration effects Agglomeration refers to the tendency of businesses to cluster together in the same region because one companys workers are anothers customers As economists Paul Krugman Masahisa Fujita and Anthony Venables showed two decades ago agglomeration can bring big benefits to whatever region has the densest concentration of economic activity Increasingly that region is China rather than the US China is where the biggest markets are so thats where multinational companies want to build their factories and offices That in turn leads to whole supply chains migrating to China as companies try to locate near their upstream suppliers and downstream customers This process is accelerated by another phenomenon known as clustering effects the collection of a huge repository of manufacturing talent and knowhow in Chinese cities Chinas general hostility to foreign companies will slow this process but the gravitational pull of the worlds biggest economy will be hard to resist This also means that President Donald Trump will be fighting an uphill battle in his trade war against China To push a company to move out of China US tariffs would have to be very high since they will have to overcome not just laborcost differences between the two countries but the pull of the Chinese market the concentration of manufacturing knowhow and the existence of stable supply chains Many companies say theyre ready to pull out but the reality may be very different for example last year Ford Motor Co declared that it would build its nextgeneration car in China Another result of Chinas new economic heft is that the web of institutions that the US built to regulate the global economy after World War II will be increasingly irrelevant and toothless The World Bank for example which lends money to poor countries is already finding itself sidelined as Chinese loans pour into developing nations One of the most important USled economic institutions is the dollar itself For decades the dollar has functioned as the worlds reserve currency nations around the world hold their foreign exchange stockpiles in dollars many issue dollardenominated debt and commodities such as oil are often priced in dollars Some believe this has put strains on the US economy because the increasing demand for dollars tends to make the currency more expensive contributing to persistent US trade deficits If this theory is right then as Chinas economy grows the US will be less able to handle the capital inflows that are necessary to remain the worlds reserve currency It would seem like a good idea for China to shoulder some of the burden of being the global reserve currency just as the US took over this duty from the UK a century ago But China insists on maintaining its system of capital controls making it hard to move money in and out of the country That will prevent the yuan from joining or replacing the dollar in international markets But as China further eclipses the US in size that could lead to greater instability in the international monetary system The final impact of Chinas economic rise is geopolitical Countries that once would cater to the US in military and political matters in order to secure access to US markets will now be tempted to switch their allegiance to China This pressure will be especially acute for East Asian countries that are close to Chinese markets The US of course could have acted to counter or slow this process by establishing a trading bloc with other East Asian countries that excluded the Chinese President Barack Obama tried to do exactly this with the TransPacific Partnership but Trump killed that deal as soon as he came into office So the fact that China is now or will soon be the worlds biggest economy matters a lot It means the US can no longer depend as much on its large markets to secure investment or geopolitical fealty Unless China makes severe missteps in the near future like barring foreign companies crushing productivity with excessive government control or precipitating domestic conflict it will enjoy many of the benefits that once flowed to its chief rival

shares in International Telephone and Telegraph at a heavy loss in protest at the US conglomerates political donations It was the Financial Times reported the first known example of a companys antisocial actions triggering such an exit from an otherwise attractive investmentThe decision taken by a corporate accountability panel comprised of the shirt companys middle managers did not much impress the FTs New York correspondentOf course the idea of a conscience committee playing David to ITTs Goliath and forcing its will on the mammoth conglomerate is laughable he wrote because the job of a money manager was simply to make money rather than subjective personal judgmentsThat verdict captured a consensus that was relatively new at the time springing from Milton Friedmans argument that for a company to pursue anything other than legal profit would be pure and unadulterated socialism Executives who spouted nonsense about social responsibility were the unwitting puppets of those who would undermine a free society the Chicago economist had thundered in a 1970 essayThe pension funds protest did not catch on but Friedmans argument did setting out a doctrine of shareholder primacy that has defined AngloSaxon capitalism for almost 50 years and shaped a world that is increasingly driven by corporationsThe pursuit of returns to companies owners at the expense of other stakeholders has undoubtedly led to greater profits generating enormous wealth for investors and the executives whose rewards have been increasingly tied to shareholder returns But it has come at a cost to employees customers and the environment incentivised boards to pay less tax diverted cash to earningsflattering share buybacks rather than investment and among those outside the privileged club of equity owners eroded the trust on which companies ultimately depend GettyA decade after the financial crisis shook voters confidence in capitalism the challenges to Friedmans model have been gathering momentum Now even as US President Donald Trump pursues stereotypically probusiness policies such as cutting corporate taxes and regulations they are starting to converge into something that looks like a new worldview shared by leading executives and investors and shaped by an unlikely alliance of consumers employees campaigners academics and regulators Together they could break a consensus that has governed business for two generations and offer a new model for capitalism based on the watchwords of purpose inclusion and sustainabilityFor this capitalist reformation to succeed however it will have to prove it has more substance than spin survive the markets down cycles and persuade a public whose faith in corporate and institutional elites remains fragileMost of the capitalists an FT journalist meets in 2019 sound more like the protesting shirtmakers of the 1970s than the Nobelwinning economist Over the past year I have had business leaders lament to me that no Wall Street analyst ever asks them about their efforts to tackle climate change I have seen companies such as Merck and Johnson amp Johnson remind investors that their preFriedman founders believed profits would only flow if they attended to other priorities first and I have heard Unilevers outgoing CEO Paul Polman ask provocatively Why should the citizens of this world keep companies around whose sole purpose is the enrichment of a few peopleStrikingly their arguments have been echoed by the worlds biggest investors the very people who seem most at risk in any shift from shareholders interestsIf Friedmans article provided the intellectual underpinning for the idea that a public companys only social responsibility was to increase its profits the catalytic text for the new era of purposeful capitalism was a letter sent to chief executives a year ago by BlackRocks Larry Fink who with 63tn of assets under management counts as the biggest investor of them allWith governments failing to prepare for the future he wrote people were looking to companies to deliver not only financial performance but a positive contribution to society benefiting customers and communities as well as shareholders Without a social purpose he contended companies fail to make the investments in employees innovation and capital expenditures needed for longterm growth and abovepar returns to the likes of BlackRockFink is far from a lone voice in his industry Assets in US funds that aim to produce social or environmental benefits alongside financial returns grew fourfold to 12tn over the past decade driven in part by millennials who surveys show are twice as likely as older generations to want their pensions to be invested responsibly That impulse has presented fund managers shaken by the rise of lowfee index trackers with an irresistible growth opportunityFink is now drafting his 2019 letter and still sounds a little shocked and pleased at how much discussion last years caused The reaction was 9010 he says a vocal minority hated it but his message resonated with far more producing a stepchange in the number of companies spelling out their purpose in annual reports I believe the viral nature of the letter was because I think society was asking for this Fink saysI can tell you not everybody agreed with Larrys letter adds David Abney chief executive of the parcel delivery company UPS but Id say theres more people leaning in Larrys direction or at least they say they areIf there is a hint of caution in Abneys last remark it may be because we have heard companies pay lip service to social virtues before now Any regular on the CEO conference circuit already knows their triple bottom line from their circular economy and can talk fluently about impact and inclusive capitalismThe acronyms have changed from CSR corporate social responsibility to ESG environmental social and governance but the desire to convince the world that business cares about more than the bottom line is nothing new Even Lehman Brothers had a page on sustainability in its 2007 annual report hailing its role as an environmentally conscious global corporate citizenA decade after Lehmans collapse only a slim majority of Americans have a positive view of capitalism among those aged 18 to 29 socialism is winning Will they be getting their hopes up about capitalists making the world a better place And with no shortage of corporate scandals from Wells Fargos fake accounts to Facebooks intrusions into its users privacy can society trust finance or business to decide what is best for societyOne answer Fink contends is that governments are even less trusted His 2018 letter was inspired he says by the breakdown of globalisation and multilateralism and what he perceived as growing global frustration that governments are doing less for votersIn the year before his last letter he notes US chief executives had spoken up for the Paris climate accord and quit White House business councils after Trumps equivocating response to white supremacist violence in Charlottesville Since then BlackRock has faced pressure over its holdings of gun company stocks after the Parkland school shooting Like it or not business is already being dragged into societys thorniest debates from immigration to LGBT rights often by consumers and employees who find it easier to influence brands than elected officialsA Gays Against Guns protest poster outside BlackRocks New York headquarters in 2016  BloombergInstitutional investors are becoming effective environmental campaigners and the concept of the activist chief executive no longer sounds like an oxymoron With many governments in disrepute leaders of finance and business have improbably been handed an opportunity to lead on some of societys most pressing issues Will they take itColin Mayer of Oxfords Sad Business School argues that they must because the Friedman doctrine of concentrating on profit alone has acted as an unnatural constraint on the multiplicity of ways a company can serve all its constituencies It is only over the past 50 years that we have witnessed the retreat of the multipurposed publicly oriented corporation into a singlefocused selfinterested entity the economist writes in an influential new book Prosperity Elevating shareholders interests above those of employees the environment or communities may have made sense when financial capital was scarce he says but now finance is abundant while human natural and social capital are in short supplyMayers manifesto recasts the companys place in society arguing alliteratively that its purpose is producing profitable solutions to problems of people and planet Profit in other words flows from the pursuit of a broader social purposeAs Harvard Business Schools Joseph Bower and Lynn Paine have written different businesses will define their purpose in different ways but the model that replaces Friedmans framework must recognise that all companies are embedded in a political and socioeconomic system whose health is vital to their sustainabilityIt is an attractive vision but it already has its doubters According to Anand Giridharadas a former fellow of the Aspen Institute thinktank corporate dogooding is nothing more than an elite charade that allows plutocrats to feel better about themselves while dodging any real challenge to the system that made them rich The Aspen Consensus in a nutshell is this he wrote in a 2015 speech that provided the spark for his 2018 bookWinners Take All The winners of our age must be challenged to do more good But never ever tell them to do less harmTo sceptics such as Giridharadas asking corporate philanthropists to solve societys problems is a recipe for the unfettered paternalism that took hold in Americas Golden Age Andrew Carnegie the unionbreaking steel magnate argued in his 1889 essay The Gospel of Wealth that the concentrations of corporate power and wealth that characterised that earlier unequal era were natural even welcome what mattered more was how the wealthy distributed their surplus riches for the common good Dont question the getting in other words if it is followed by givingSome of those who have argued longest for business to serve a social purpose argue that it cannot do so within the current system The global financial crisis has woken people up in the streets and in boardrooms around the world to say we need to look at the system design flaws that produced that outcome says Jay Coen Gilbert The height of lunacy is to seek different outcomes while doing the same thing over againGilbert is a founder of BLab which in 2007 began certifying a new type of company called a B Corporation with a mandate to benefit all stakeholders and a commitment to submit to regular tests of its social and environmental impact As the corporate mainstream becomes more missiondriven larger multinationals are now showing interest from banks to energy companies Danone North America became a B Corp last April joining 2600 others including Patagonia Gap subsidiary Athleta and the Unileverowned Seventh Generation and Ben amp JerrysThe B Corp model has also inspired Elizabeth Warren the Massachusetts senator who in August proposed an Accountable Capitalism Act that would oblige companies with revenues over 1bn to consider the interests of employees customers and their communities alongside those of investors With Warren this week announcing a run for the Democrats 2020 presidential nomination the shareholder supremacy debate could soon be thrashed out on primetime televisionEven those supporters of purposeful capitalism who would rather rebalance companies priorities within the current system admit that hurdles stand in the path of reform The biggest is the challenge of how to measure something as vague as purpose which can encompass anything from treating suppliers fairly to cutting carbon emissionsMetrics are the soft underbelly of the ESG movement warns Martin Whittaker chief executive of JUST Capital which ranks US companies on whether they are creating jobs paying fair wages and contributing to the health of their communities and planet Friedman fans should note that JUSTs rankings are based on a poll of the publics priorities for business that ranks shareholders dead lastSome see an opportunity in the need for better data EYs chief executive Mark Weinberger predicts that the task of assessing such metrics for clients will someday be as important a business for his Big Four accounting firm as financial audits are now But nobody has yet devised a way to measure purpose that is as simple as the bottom line of a profit and loss account If a company misses its earnings target investors journalists and even algorithms know how to respond But how should they react if it falls short of its stated purposeFor as long as activist investors and opportunistic bidders are waiting to pounce on underperformers no board will neglect the metric that most drives its stock And while the purposebeforeprofit movement has gathered momentum in a rising market we do not know how it will fare in the next recessionInevitably a downturn wont help says Clare Chapman cochair of the UKs Purposeful Company Task Force She notes however that within companies that had focused on the environment diversity and other social responsibilities before the financial crisis those priorities survived because quite simply running a business shortterm is a fast way of running it into the groundFink and Polman have become influential champions for the purposedriven model but they are on a short list of names that tend to come up in most discussions of this movement If corporate purpose remains the preserve of a small group of western chief executives on the Davos circuit it will fall shortChina India and others are absolutely not on the case at all says Elizabeth Littlefield a US development veteran who chairs the Global Impact Investing Networks investor forum It cant just be an echo chamber of CEOs who have the luxury of being concerned about these things I worry about how we make this a truly global movementEven those inside the echo chamber know that some of the smaller businesses they deal with are not fully on board One chief executive who would not go on the record saying this remarked drily Almost all of our customers are interested in what we can do to clean the environment and other stuff You can tell its one of their core valuesuntil you get to priceIn sum the purposefirst movement is still far from ubiquitous and lacking in reliable data but is the pursuit of something beyond profit worse than Friedmans singular focus on shareholder returns Encouraging companies to have a clear mission consider their communities and steer their innovative impulses to good ends may not add up to systemic change but it is surely better than the alternativeCritics such as Giridharadas would rather society concentrate on restoring politics as the forum through which we address its challenges But for as long as politicians are viewed with more suspicion than chief executives and investors the purposeful capitalists may be our best hopeConsumers employees and campaigners are already learning how effective they can be in pushing companies to balance other stakeholders concerns with their returns to shareholders Companies in turn have discovered that doing so can improve their reputations persuade investors that they have a sustainable strategy and ultimately benefit their bottom lineWhen corporate America is paying chief executives 168 times as much as the median employee steering the windfall from a historic tax cut to optionsboosting buybacks and consolidating into ever larger groups executives claiming to be solving societys ills can expect pushbackThe pursuit of purpose will not end the questions over how much chief executives should earn what wages and taxes companies should pay or how much corporate power society will tolerate Nor will investors stop judging chief executives by their share prices But 50 years of putting shareholders first left corporations little trusted by nonshareholders and many are ready to try something differentAs companies selfinterest converges with the interests of other stakeholders those who would improve the world have a chance to get some of the worlds most powerful instruments for change onside They should grasp the opportunity businesss moral money moment has given themAndrew EdgecliffeJohnson is the FTs US business

still very mixed Some areas badly affected by the downturn are still struggling while others are recording sales at record high prices Most of our coverage this year has focused on the Manhattan

enjoy sunnier timesDan Conn chief executive of Christies International Real EstateLast year Christies International Real Estate noted that booming markets would slow because of tightened lending conditions and increased costs via tax policy to foreign buyers as a disincentive measure That proved true in Canada as the major hubs are still adjusting to new government policies in Vancouver for example sales of luxury properties decreased yearonyear to October 30 Our affiliate Faith Wilson refers to this softening as an excellent time for buyers to shop Vancouver We see Canada posting gains in 2019 despite cooling factors as luxury buyers continue to gravitate towards international safe havens that offer good quality of life That said on a relative basis compared with other major global centres of economic activity it will continue to be a strong market for luxury real estateIn the US last year we predicted that a bull market would bolster luxury residential property sales The tax code overhaul also provided affluent Americans in general with a substantial financial boost which helped support the market overall That said rate rises are clearly affecting pricing and the elimination of the state and local tax deductions in the US hit sellers further in hightax states such as New York New Jersey Connecticut and California The federal tax reform is keeping more buyers on the sidelines there until the full impact of the new federal tax becomes clearer and prices find a new equilibrium in 2019 Lowtax states such as Florida Wyoming and Nevada fared better however as affluent homebuyers look for alternative primary residence locations that limit tax burdens In Miami for example luxury property sales activity is beginning to pick up after several years of decline

maintain liquidity in markets in North America the US lags Canada by 18 months Worries that Canadian property was flirting with disaster with rising debt and defaults could have tipped the market into recession but that has been avoided for now Concerns do seem to have been overplayed but some significant issues remain After a turbulent couple of years the US market appears to have topped out but dark clouds are gathering As with all markets there are exceptions but sales of new homes and permits are down a traditional store of wealth for many Americans Americans seem to be concerned about the

feeling the bone weariness that comes from an honest days work and congratulate myself that at least some of my students get elasticity of demandI have got so much better at teaching that these days I

social animal but sometimes alas man is on his her own and it seems doubly mean to penalise her by refusing her a drink At the end of a long day I invariably sip a glass of wine as I cook read or watch TV Alcohol does not only make me more agreeable to my friends It makes me more agreeable to myself Drink has enriched my life in all sorts of ways It has helped me form relationships with men It has even made me a better parent When the children were little I never had a drink until they were in bed which meant that regular 7pm bedtimes were religiously enforced Too much alcohol is a very bad idea But what is too much The government tells us what our meagre ration should be but I have a better guide in the shape of my own body If I wake at night thirsty or if I feel even slightly groggy in the morning thats too much My body is getting stricter as I age and it now tells me clearly that a third of a bottle of wine is my upper limitYou dont need to be a professor of social psychology to know that humans respond to rewards for hard work For my students the reward is an achievement mark For me the reward is much nicer its a glass of wine Lucy Kellaway is an FT contributing editor and

Thank you for having us back JEFFREY GUNDLACH Welcome to DoubleLine SCOTT WAPNER Almost a year to the day we were last with you JEFFREY GUNDLACH I think it was December 13th last year SCOTT WAPNER Thats right Were still volatile in the market Today is another representation of that Were still about 50 points above on the SampP of the February lows JEFFREY GUNDLACH Yes SCOTT WAPNER Do you think were going to go below that JEFFREY GUNDLACH Well in the fullness of time I think absolutely well go below that Im pretty sure this is a bear market People like this definition of 20 down as a bear market but thats obviously very arbitrary Ive been around over 35 years in the business and have seen a number of bear markets Its more about how you lead into it how it develops and how the sentiment changes and I think weve had pretty much all of the variables that characterize a bear market I remember going  usually something happens that really doesnt make any sense at all and Im kind of amazed how it goes on longer than it should like back in the dotcom days when companies were being IPOd and had no sales let alone revenues thats hard to be and they would actually explode to the upside on the IPO Thats kind of crazy and then we had the subprime lending with pick a pay loans back in 05 and 06 and that was kind of crazy and that went on longer than it should have This time like we talked about a year ago it was crypto bitcoin which was truly a mania we talked a year ago it just went up Maybe in the end its a good thing or the block chain technology is a good thing The way it was being treated and believed in was a mania and then it crashed about a week after we met a year ago and it was at 17500 when we were speaking right in this spot and of course now its down below 3500 so an 85 decline And one after another you start to see various sectors of the global financial markets give it up The global stock market peaked January 26th And so did the New York Stock Exchange composite January 26 but the Dow Jones Industrials the Nasdaq the SampP 500 All of these things one by one started to roll over and come the summertime or later in the summertime you were down to the FAANGs and then you were down to two stocks it was amazon and apple and then amazon gave it up And then finally when they decided they werent going to tell you how many phones they sold anymore apple gave it up SCOTT WAPNER That was the last straw JEFFREY GUNDLACH That was kind of the last straw It was October 3rd when the tariffs  well it was that USMC  whatever its called its really NAFTA but it was announced we would have this change in NAFTA that would lead to a requirement that a certain fraction of car parts be made in higher costs locales which basically meant not Mexico A senior executive at ford motor said well obviously were going to have to raise the prices on our cars if input prices are going up Suddenly the market seemed to wake up to the fact that this was real and the next day the stock market tipped over in fact on October 3rd Jay Powell said were a long way from neutral And that was a big problem too SCOTT WAPNER That seemed to be the tipping point JEFFREY GUNDLACH Yes that with the USMCA thing and the Ford Motor executive those things seemed to come together and coalesce into weve had enough And yeah the Jay Powell thing was interpreted by the market as a scary thing the fed was going to keep going a long distance further and then the market dropped over 10 and suddenly the Fed had to massage the rhetoric And suddenly it was well we have a new definition of neutral maybe Were actually within the lower bound or close to the lower bound of neutral in an attempt to stabilize the market So yeah it seems like a bear market to me in the way things trade with late day volume being bad and the like the best thing for the near term I think is that the most export sensitive stock market South Korea the Kospi bottomed October 29 so at least thats not pushing to new lows and emerging markets broadly are doing better because theyre extremely export driven Maybe this leg down is getting toward an exhaustion point the sentiment is pretty dark right now Id be happier on the short term outlook if the VIX would go above 40 which is usually a sign SCOTT WAPNER That would be quite a spike JEFFREY GUNDLACH Well thats typically what happens when you get to the bottom theres so much nervousness and fear but the Vix is a little bit disturbing how it doesnt go higher Actually as the market pushes to the down side But i think this is a bear market and i think well go below the February lows almost with certainty SCOTT WAPNER Is it a long lasting bear market or it can be short term as some have suggested on our air and then this secular bull market will resume JEFFREY GUNDLACH I dont think so I think its a bear market I think weve had the first leg down and the second leg down is usually more painful than the first leg down if this is indeed a bear market Maybe in the short term were getting flushed out I think its lasted a long time It has a lot to do with the fact i believe were in a situation that maybe unprecedented was too strong but it is highly unusual that we are increasing the budget deficit so spectacularly so late in the cycle while the fed is hiking interest rates I know youve teased the segment by talking about the suicide mission Ive been talking about for months The fed almost seems to be on a suicide mission What i mean by that the deficit in the United States is extraordinarily high from where we are in the economic cycle and given what the debt level accumulated is already In the first two months of fiscal 19 it was just announced last week theres a funny thing that happened in November where the payments for December ended up being pushed to November because December 1st was on a Saturday if you take that out its 44 billion thats a big number So if you wake that out and say thats December and not November Still the first two months of fiscal 19 the budget deficit is going up at an annualized rate of 162 trillion And thats the official budget deficit The actual budget deficit is larger than what the report  for example for fiscal 18 which ends September 30th the deficit was around 800 billion But the national debt went up by 13 trillion almost now Why Whats the difference there There are items that are off budget So the budget deficit really for fiscal 18 was 13 nearly trillion thats 6 of GDP and were supposedly having a good economy and were supposedly having jobs growth and all this other great stuff In actuality we increase the deficit by 6 of GDP since government deficit change is a significant fraction a significant variable in the GDP equation it seems to me theres no real economic growth thats happening away from the deficit So what worries me is that as we move into a weaker economy which will happen at some points and certainly the economy looks weaker now than it did entering 2018 that the deficit will continue to expand at a rate which could be prohibitive for the usual decline in interest rates helping to stimulate the economy Thats what I think is the real big variable investors need to focus on And while this is happening with the deficit exploding the fed is raising interest rates which means the interest expense is going to be increasing year by year as these zero interest rates that we had for a number of years start to roll off and the bonds have to be refloated once they mature the next five years we have something like 7 trillion of treasuries that are maturing the average coupon on those treasuries is almost as low as 2 slightly higher 21 When they roll over theyre going to be at a higher interest rate because the fed has been on the suicide mission of raising interest rates so the interest expense on that 7 trillion of treasuries is going to be  maybe the rate will be at 3 like it is now or maybe 4 and you might even see we have an expense that goes up 100 140 billion So kind of the of our government is coming back to haunt us ultimately In financial markets these things go on so much longer than they should Ross Perot ran for president running infomercials about we were doomed on the deficit and there was a book written in 1992 that same year that was somewhat sponsored by the Peterson Foundation called bankruptcy 1994 And the idea behind the book was we have this compounding curve and this debt problem that is going to come back and really cause us problems Well he was early He was early by at least 26 years But hes right you cant keep going on with the debt finance scheme and Im worried when the next recession comes we could be looking at well heck were supposedly in a good economy and the next two months were running 16 trillion what if we go into a recession whats the deficit going to be 3 trillion And does that mean interest rates dont go down during the next recession which is an idea Ive been noodling around for a long time maybe they go higher with Ive had a call the next two years that come 2021 the tenyear treasury will be at 6 I get a lot of pushback a lot of debt deflation is out there in the twittersphere absolutely wrong the economy cant handle higher interest rates Interest rates might have a life of their own It might not matter what the market can handle or cant handle SCOTT WAPNER they havent to this point Its been somewhat surprising that rates have remained where they are you said 3 They hit 3 325 Here we are below 29 today JEFFREY GUNDLACH yes on the ten year I was focusing on the three year when it broke above 325 that was incredibly important frankly I didnt think wed go back below 325 once we broke above because it seemed like such an important level Here we are back below 325 But not impressively not in a way that would be consistent with a big decline in the global stock market Theres a thing called the death cross Its a 50day moving average goes below 200 a day particularly when theyre both declining Presently about 80 of the countries in the MSCI World Index are in a death cross 80 Its amazing And there was a chart that got a lot of play put out by deutsche bank about how many risk assets globally are in officially bear market down the arbitrary 20 number that again i dont really ascribe to but so commonly used at that they used it and the highest in the data series going back to 1901 Its like 90 of the risk assets around the world in dollar terms are in bear markets So its a pretty widespread and coordinated set of weaknesses SCOTT WAPNER Are you saying that by embarking on this suicide mission that the fed shouldnt raise interest rates this week JEFFREY GUNDLACH I dont really think thats the main thrust of my idea this week yeah they shouldnt raise them this week SCOTT WAPNER They shouldnt JEFFREY GUNDLACH No I dont think they should The bond market is saying fed youve got no way you should be raising interest rates look at the 2s 3s fiveyear part of the yield curve which are flat at 270 I guess that corroborative of a hike But it is basically saying in the year 2019 youre going to have a cut this big but a cut that was priced into the yield curve and in 2020 another cut The problem though isnt that the fed shouldnt be raising rates The problem is the fed shouldnt have kept them so low for so long SCOTT WAPNER Sure JEFFREY GUNDLACH The problem we shouldnt have had negative interest rates like we still have in Europe We shouldnt have done quantitative easing which is a circular financing scheme The problem really is the deficit The fed is kind of helpless here The fact that the deficit is so out of control this late in the economic cycle we have never before had the fed raise interest rates while the budget deficit was expanding its never happened Because usually the budget deficit expands in response to a recession Its a way of stimulating to get us out of recession Instead we did it as a last gasp of keeping this economic recovery going by making it completely deficit based SCOTT WAPNER So this morning President Trump once again Tweeted about the Fed Quote Its incredible that with a very strong dollar and virtually no inflation the outside world blowing up around us Paris burning China way down that the Fed is even considering another interest rate hike Take the victory he stayed Stan Druckenmiller today OpEd Wall Street Journal The Fed should quote Pause its doublebarreled blitz of higher rates and tighter liquidity So theyre right you agree with them JEFFREY GUNDLACH I do agree with them Ive been saying this pretty much all year the doublebarreled was actually  he may have borrowed that from me thats how Ive been talking about its how Ive been phrasing it all year that weve really been tightening interest rates in a way thats more than people understand Theres a duo of economists at the Atlanta Fed called Wu and Xia who did a study a few years back What was the effect of quantitative easing If they hadnt done the quantitative easing and instead had taken the European model and gone to negative interest rates how negative would those rates have had to be to have the same stimulative effect as the quantitative easing And they concluded and I dont know if theyre right or not its very hypothetical but their conclusion was that the quantitative easing amounted to 300 basis points of further cuts So if they hadnt done quantitative easing to have the same stimulative effect the Fed funds would have had been negative 300 basis points Well lets just say theyre right Since they did about 25 trillion of quantitative easing and it was 300 basis points 25 trillion divided by 3 is roughly 800 billion Okay So 800 billion is  800 billion divided by 4 means thats what quantitative easing is one cut So 100 basis points is 800 billion So divided by 4 25 basis points is 200 billion of quantitative easing Well so far were pushing towards 400 billion  were not there yet but were soon to be there  of quantitative tightening That means weve had would more rate hikes from quantitative tightening if Wu and Xia are right So the Fed hasnt just raised rates in that context eight times Theyve raised them ten times And the quantitative tightening is stated to be as high as 600 billion over fiscal 19 So thats another three rate hikes So if they were going to follow their dots and raise rates so many times theres another three on top of that So the amount of tightening has been underappreciated I think and Stan is right as he often is hes one of the greatest investors ever for him and Chanos the two titans of the hedge fund industry Theyre right that we are seeing the bond market react in a way that is historically very predictive of the Fed should not be doing this And yet we have this strange dynamic that theyve almost promised a rate hike here in December And then the President shows up with his Tweets trying to bully them into not doing it and it puts Jay Powell and the team in a very tough position Because theyre damned if they do and damned if they dont SCOTT WAPNER You know what people are going to say if this week they dont hike Theyre going to say Powell bowed to Trumps pressure and the criticism that hes taking JEFFREY GUNDLACH Could well be Its either that or probably also the stock markets and the global stock markets pressure as well The argument that I have to laugh at though that I hear on financial media is people get up there and say if the Fed doesnt hike its going to be super bad for the market because people are afraid the Fed knows some supersecret bad news what a joke What a joke The Fed doesnt have any supernatural powers They know what we know They dont know any more than we know They have 700 PhD economists which is an amazing number but they didnt see the lending problems back in 2006 So they didnt have supernatural powers back then I doubt they have them now I think if the Fed doesnt hike it will be the stock market is weaker and also the global economy is slowing down I mean things like the Citigroup data change series every region is now negative Even the United States has flipped slightly negative And what that does is it says Whats the economic trend relative to the last 12month average and now its below everywhere So yeah I mean the data is definitely slowing And the last quarter of GDP the President loves to talk about this as the greatest jobs economy ever which is completely untrue There were more jobs per month under Obamas last two years than there have under Trumps first two years You know he likes to talk about how great it is but the last quarter GDP of 35 real was all inventories just about If you take inventories out inventory building real GDP was 12 in the third quarter Thats it Down from a massive number in the quarter before that because that quarter had a lot less inventory building So the economy is definitely slowing down Unemployment claims weekly are kind of bottoming out The one thing thats still really good are the leading economic indicators In the United States the PMI Surveys the sentiment surveys theyre all still really strong and not suggestive of recession SCOTT WAPNER Youve said as recently as last week that there arent inflationary  excuse me recessionary winds  JEFFREY GUNDLACH The only one  SCOTT WAPNER  Blowing JEFFREY GUNDLACH Theres a couple things that are on the radar screen now At the beginning of this year there were literally zero Now theres a couple One is this weird yield curve that we have with 2s 3s and 5s exactly the same I wouldnt call this inverted because theyre pretty much the same yield But hats somewhat concerning when the yield curve flattens out And also consumer expectations are really bad right now If you  consumer confidence their awareness of where things are today is still very strong But if you compare expectations for the future its amazingly weak compared to where they are In fact if you subtract expectations for the future from feelings of current conditions theyre more negative than prior to the great recession So consumers seem to be smelling something that isnt going right and it probably has something to do with interest rates and home prices having gone up so much more than wages What you see in the surveys of Is this a good time to buy a house University of Michigan does this survey its pretty weak It was very strong at the beginning of the year and now its not very far off where it was prior to the last recession SCOTT WAPNER So given all that youve said why isnt this simply a growth scare Why isnt the economy doing better than you think We had a Rapid Update a CNBC Rapid Update that Steve Liesman does last week Fourth quarter GDP ticked up 3 Next year 4 JEFFREY GUNDLACH Yeah retail sales were strong SCOTT WAPNER So why  maybe the economy is better than people think JEFFREY GUNDLACH No I dont  I think its a debtbased economy So it depends  when retail sales go up because people borrowed more money is that really good I mean if you meet an old buddy of yours from college and you say How are you doing and the guy says Im doing great Ive got a huge mortgage I have a second on top of that I have four credit cards all maxed out and I have this brandnew watch I am killing it And he says How are you doing You go Gee I dont know I mean I paid off my mortgage I dont have any credit cards Ive got a million dollars saved Which one is doing well I mean the one thats consuming a lot might feel good in the moment Like our consumers feel good in the moment based on the current confidence surveys but their expectations for the future are weak Well that sounds like the guy who is your buddy in college It doesnt sound like you who has actually saved and are in a position to invest in the future So I dont really think the economy is all that great I think that when the deficit expands by hundreds of billions of dollars and you get a couple percentage of GDP thats just debt All you did was borrow money and of course it leads to shortterm economic growth But how are we going to keep this going when we have 16 trillion 8 of GDP nearly is what were growing our deficit at You noticed there was a kerfuffle in Europe about  Italy was going to run a budget deficit and all of the Mandarins were berating them for being irresponsible Well France is at 34 Look at these elitists in France 34 budget deficit berating Italy for being at 24 But the US is at 6 plus if you look at the real numbers You know if Europe  its a very large budget deficit that were running and thats whats driving our economy and the corporate economy is also leveraged up at record levels Record levels that previously have been harbingers of recession You cant blame the CFOs at Americas companies They were given incredibly low interest rates by the extreme stimulus policies and debt causes a yield starvation the collapse spreads corporate yields were by far the lowest in history and of course they leveraged up and borrowed money to buy back stocks and leverage up the corporate economy further So we have a very high vulnerability to interest rates and were seeing that already When we spoke a year ago and I said If yields go up to 3 stocks are going to take gas that doesnt seem like a very high interest rate does it It is when you have zero knit into the marrow of your economic bones which is what we basically did by leaving the rate so low for so long SCOTT WAPNER So then you believe and agree with what Janet Yellen said last week about corporate credit what Paul Tudor Jones and others have been warning about and you yourself have warned about JEFFREY GUNDLACH Ive been warning about corporate credit for a long time I said in 2017 September that when rates go up the worst performing bond sector will be investment grade corporate bonds And boy was I right I mean corporate bonds have been bad this year In fact I did a webcast last Tuesday I havent looked at the numbers since then but emerging market dollar denominated debt has stronger  had stronger yeartodate returns through last Tuesday than investment grade corporate bonds And thats amazing when you think about how emerging markets broadly have suffered with the stronger dollar and the tariff talks Investment grade corporate bonds have been bad And at this juncture theres some chance of them recovering a little bit if rates rise because the spreads are wider anyway but if rates rise significantly the duration the interest rate risk of that sector is very very high And if interest rates have the impetus to fall which I  it doesnt seem like they do because theyre not acting well with the correction on the stock market something bad has to be happening in the economy for interest rates to fall from here Something really bad has to happen deflationary or recessionary And thats not good for the default positioning of the corporate bond market So corporate credit is Im negative on corporate credit well Ive been negative basically maximally negative for about a year SCOTT WAPNER Leverage loan market JEFFREY GUNDLACH Leverage loan market is less scary to me I know its been weak lately with lots of outflows Thats because the markets reprising in the Fed Leverage loans had a strong bid as they should have as the Fed was raising interest rates They float I mean the leverage loans theres portfolio that is yield 6 even 7 if you lower credit Thats pretty good when you look at the screen of treasuries yielding 3 But leverage loans started to say Uhoh maybe the Feds not going to keep raising interest rates and maybe the reason theyre not is this weaker economic data So were not going to get a coupon hike with the Fed and I might be worried about a recessionary situation well theyve sold off a little bit But theyre still the best performing bond sector year to date SCOTT WAPNER What does it say to you  and The FT had interesting article yesterday or the day before Not a single company has borrowed money through the high yield market this month The first month that thats happened since November of 08 JEFFREY GUNDLACH Its been a long time Yeah zero issuance SCOTT WAPNER Whats the message in that JEFFREY GUNDLACH Well rates are higher I mean they had so many opportunities to borrow money at lower interest rate levels and then spreads blew out in October High yield spreads went out by 100 basis points maybe even 125 And so theyre probably saying Maybe well get a better opportunity to do this The market is not all that liquid right now and its not that easy like it was to float debt Theres a lot more concern with rates going up and spreads going out So the market isnt all that welcoming to corporate debt borrowers And thats the message Now maybe theyll be a significant issue in the first quarter of the year perhaps And well see if the market can handle it SCOTT WAPNER Alright Were going to step away for a quick break Well come back We have much more ahead with DoubleLines Jeffrey Gundlach from out here live and exclusively in Los Angeles Were back right after this SCOTT WAPNER Welcome back to Los Angeles Were live from DoubleLine headquarters on their trading floor with Jeffrey Gundlach 1230 in the east 930 am Locally Lets talk about the risks out of dc you mentioned some of the policies in DC What about the midterm election results What about the prospect of more earnings the Mueller report impeachment all of that into the prism of how you see risks in DC affecting the markets JEFFREY GUNDLACH None of that sounds like a positive The midterm elections I thought would lead to and maybe its still possible but so much contention I thought it would lead to perhaps even more spending from infrastructure Because the president has talked a lot about infrastructure and he wanted to do a big build out and it seemed the democrats were sort of on that same page I think Nancy Pelosi was very in favor of that idea maybe they just are so so much anathema maybe they could never get along But if theres one thing they could do together its probably some sort of an infrastructure build that could just lead to more debt It could lead to a shortterm stimulation of the economy when it comes to the hearings and the like Im starting to to treat that with i wouldnt say a great deal of concern but i was pretty dismissive of that prior to the midterms That seems to be building in a way thats problematic in terms of building uncertainty The whole Mueller thing and almost the promises of forever investigations that just strikes me as being unhelpful SCOTT WAPNER You still  you see the scene from the oval office last week JEFFREY GUNDLACH Oh the ambush sort of SCOTT WAPNER The President Vice President Schumer Pelosi JEFFREY GUNDLACH It was like the Vice President wasnt really there but yeah Schumer Pelosi and the President I thought was theatrical for sure Im not sure what the purpose was SCOTT WAPNER Do you think infrastructure and things like that are possible after that setting and scene JEFFREY GUNDLACH Thats why I prefaced my remarks the way I did That scene was pretty remarkable in terms of the contentiousness Maybe nothing happens at all except focuses on these investigations and that just strikes me as being a negative we talked about the dollar was strong and all that I believe that the dollar peaked out January of 2017 I said so at the time It was at 103 on the Dixie index and dropped all the way down and there was tremendous bullish sentiment on the dollar in January of 17 and it dropped by about 15 from there down to the high 80s and rallied into the 9798 zone which I think will be the high for the dollar I think the dollar  the next big move on the dollar Ive been saying this for a long time I think the next big move for the dollar is down It has a lot to do with the deficits it has a lot to do with the twin deficits The dollar correlates very well with the size of the twin deficits in other words when the deficit goes much bigger in broad strokes the dollar goes down and I think that the dollar could be under siege from other blocks and countries wanting for the dollar not to have reserve currency status exclusively anymore And clearly with the budget deficit at 6 of GDP going higher theres no way that we would have the dollar at this level if we didnt have the global reserve currency status China has been making moves definitely to try to come into that club Theyve been buying oil futures in their own currency this year for the first time and got up to double digits Thats a mechanism to show youre of that stature there was an official at the ECB I cant remember who he was but he was saying we want the euro to be a global reserve currency good luck with that one given what is going on in Europe but it is just the sentiment of it that leads me to believe the next big move on the dollar is down I think what Ive been talking about the last few months remains an important theme and that is the outperformance of the United States stock market was truly almost historically unique during the middle part of this year The global stock market topped out January 26th and then they all fell together the US and the world into may and then a very strange thing happened after being so coordinated for a year the US stock market went on to make new highs while the global stock market went to a 12 month low From May until early October the US stock market went up by over 10 the global stock market went down almost 10 i said in my September total return webcast I said this is very unusual If the stock market heads back down and takes out that low of September then I think the US will have to join it Boy was I right the global stock market took that out and Oct 4 us stock market gave it up and now since then they have been moving together again and I think that is important because the nonUS stock market is substantially cheaper than the us stock market Particularly the emerging markets in Asia and elsewhere but i think the ones in Asia better very cheap to US stock market Its interesting that since weve had this market turmoil over the past couple of months kind of quietly and without getting anyones attention the emerging markets have been outperforming and I think thats a relative good sign for their prospects if Im right that we are in a bear market scenario SCOTT WAPNER You like the emerging markets JEFFREY GUNDLACH Relatively SCOTT WAPNER We sat here a year ago and you said you love India JEFFREY GUNDLACH Ive loved India for years SCOTT WAPNER India outperformed the other emerging markets slightly JEFFREY GUNDLACH Its down I dont look at India as  Ive been recommending that for many years and its a multidecade call I tell people

governor’s approach,https://www.ft.com/content/e90cc006-fed7-11e8-aebf-99e208d3e521,2018-12-19 04:00:38,Urjit Patels resignation from theReserve Bank of India this month followed wellpublicised tensions with the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi which had put pressure on him to do more to boost the economy as a general election draws nearBut private rumbles against the former governor had been heard well beyond the corridors of power in New Delhi During Mr Patels twoyear tenure some in Mumbais financial sector had grown unhappy with what they saw as his aloof attitude to their industry and unbending approach to its supervisionNow executives are keenly watching for signs of how policy under the RBIs new governor veteran bureaucrat Shaktikanta Das will affect the outlook for a financial sector that has been through an unusually turbulent periodIn a press conference shortly after his appointment Mr Das was at pains to stress his determination to uphold the autonomy and the integrity and the credibility of the RBI which was undermined in the view of many analysts by the government pressure on Mr PatelAnalysts at Fitch have questioned whether government influence would weaken the RBIs commitment to an inflationtargeting regime introduced in 2016 The central bank raised rates twice in quick succession this summer amid growing inflationary pressure driven by rising oil pricesInflation has now fallen back and Mr Patels departure has fuelled expectation of monetary easing early in the new year something that would be strongly welcomed by an Indian business community that has been loudly calling for rate cuts to tackle a recent liquidity squeezeThe governors power to set policy interest rates was diluted by the 2016 reforms under which monetary policy is decided by a sixperson committee where the governor has a casting vote More telling than monetary policy under Mr Das therefore may be his approach to the supervision of financial institutions a subject of particularly fraught debate under his predecessorMr Das last week met the heads of several of the statecontrolled lenders that still dominate Indian banking accounting for twothirds of sector assets They reportedly asked him to relax the prompt corrective action system under which 11 of the 21 state banks particularly badly hit by a spike in nonperforming corporate loans have been forced to curtail their lending until their balance sheets are strengthenedThis relief was one of the key government requests during Mr Patels final weeks at the RBI as officials argued that the restrictions were unnecessarily depressing loan growth But Viral Acharya an RBI deputy governor has hit back at this claim arguing that the restrictions are vital to stabilise the strained balance sheets of the weakest state lendersThe economic impact of the restrictions meanwhile has been cushioned as privatesector rivals step in note analysts at Jefferies While lending at the 11 state banks under special measures fell by 8 per cent yearonyear in the third quarter it surged by 21 per cent at the countrys privatesector banksThe latter group too was the target of firm action under Mr Patel and will be watching for any sign of easing up under his successorKotak Mahindra Bank one of the biggest private lenders went to court this month to challenge an RBI order forcing its founder to sell a third of his stake by yearend The heads of three other big privatesector peers all hurt by a jump in bad corporate loans announced their departures this year after the RBI made clear it wanted them goneA particularly acute early test for Mr Das could come with any flareup of a recent crunch in Indias shortterm debt market which was roiled by defaults from ILampFS a large nonbank financial company or NBFC These lenders had been a key driver of loan growth over the past three years against a background of the state banks woes while relying heavily on shortterm funding from the marketThe debt market crunch created yet another bone of contention between Mr Patel and the government which unsuccessfully pushed him to set up a special credit facility for NBFCs Liquidity has improved there were strong inflows of Rs24tn into Indian money market funds in November more than reversing the outflows during Septembers market turmoilBut conditions remain tighter than before the crunch note analysts at Nomura Signs of stress in Indias real estate market they add could presage a spike in asset quality problems for the NBFCs something that would bring renewed pressure for central bank interventionBut Mr Patel was right to resist the pressure for an emergency NBFC credit line which would have encouraged institutions to strengthen an unhealthy reliance on shortterm funding in the expectation of central bank support should it dry upSimilarly while a relaxation of the prompt corrective action measures would probably boost loan growth in the preelection period it would undermine the crucial drive to draw a line under the state banks crippling bad loan problems For all the gripes against the departed governor within the financial sector his successor can best promote the industrys longterm health by emulating his firm stance towards itsimonmundyftcom

October to embark on a monthlong exodus to the US a migrantrights activist tried desperately to quash their halfformed plansStop this Irineo Mujica yelled in a frantic October phone call to Honduran politician and promigrant activist Bartolo Fuentes who had publicized the caravan on hisFacebookpageMr Mujica head of a migrantadvocacy group in Mexico and the US angrily told Mr Fuentes that US President Donald Trump would use the images of poor Hondurans marching toward the US to stir up a devils brew of antiimmigrant fears and hatred just days before the crucial US midterm election I dont control these people Mr Fuentes replied according to Mr Mujica The caravans ranks soon swelled to some 5000 people inspiring other groups to march to the Mexican border city of Tijuana where many live crammed into crowded shelters as they await their chance to enter the US legally or illegallyAs Mr Mujica predicted the caravan became more political fodder for one of the most contentious and emotional issues dividing the US Differences over immigration are at the heart of the partial shutdown of the federal government since Dec 21 after Congress and the White House failed to break an impasse over Mr Trumps demand for 5 billion to build a wall along the southern borderBy most measures the caravan has been a disaster for the migrants cause In the US the partisan divide on the hotbutton issue of immigration has deepened Experts say any comprehensive deal on immigration reform is farther away than everOf about 8000 migrants who crossed into Mexico in October and November in several caravans some 2000 have returned voluntarily to their home countries and another 150 were deported by Mexican authorities About 1500 have crossed illegally into the US while the remaining 4500 or so are jammed into shelters in Tijuana and MexicaliIn Tijuana a city largely created by immigrants and historically sympathetic to them the sudden influx of migrants has led to rare outbursts of anger In November some 300 local residents protested against the migrants demanding they leave Mexico first demonstrators shoutedTensions flared anew in late November when US border agents clashed with migrants after about 500 of them rushed part of the fenced border in Tijuana People on both sides of the immigration issue were shocked by the televised images of migrants scaling the fence and border agents firing teargas canisters into a crowd that included crying children and anguished mothersPresident Trump determined to stop immigration along the southern US border deployed in November some 5000 troops who strung concertina wire on parts of the tall steel fence that separates long stretches of the two countries This month his administration said it would return asylum seekers to Mexico while their immigration proceedings go forward rather than allow them to remain in the US This policy shift will hurt the migrants ability to prepare their cases and diminish their chances of receiving asylum in the US migrant advocates sayPresident Trump said the US will end Central American aid as thousands of migrants march toward the US border The WSJs Gerald F Seib explains why this might be counterproductive Photo GettyFor months Mr Trump has used the caravan to justify his immigration policy The reason the migrant caravans hadnt been able to enter the US he tweeted earlier this month were his efforts to secure the border with more barriers and border agents as well as by dispatching the soldiers Had I known it would be this hard for us I would have not joined the caravan said Jos Sagastume a migrant who left his wife and two children in Honduras Many hoped the US would let us pass But now people are stranded with no clear solution aheadAs the caravan wound its way through Mexico some analysts saw it as a new model for Central Americans making their way north By traveling in large groups with ample media attention migrants could travel more safely through lawless regions of MexicoBut the size of the caravans and the worldwide attention they garnered may doom any possibility of others following in their pathNumbers makes it a lot easier to get through Mexico but a lot harder to get into the US said Andrew Selee president of the Washingtonbased Migration Policy Institute This puts a giant target on their back meaning the US and Mexico are highly focused on this groupAmericans are deeply divided on the issue of illegal migration A November survey conducted by the Pew Research Center shows some 68 of Republicans believe reducing illegal immigration should be a top US foreignpolicy priority while just 20 of Democrats say that is the case That is the biggest split on this issue in the last 20 years Pew said in its reportThe caravan probably did not change anyones mind about immigration from Mexico but probably did reinforce what they already think said Karen Jacobsen a professor of migration at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in Medford Mass Those who are generally opposed to immigration will be more convinced its a bad idea and should be stopped with walls and soldiers And those who favor immigration will see the desperate situation of people and want to help themMr Trumps focus on the caravan and the subsequent media spotlight helped the president mobilize supporters to turn out to the polls analysts say But the scenes of the migrants suffering and the force used against them also mobilized Democrats and others who believe immigrants should be welcomedThe result analysts say at best a wash for Republicans in midterm elections Republican Sen Ted Cruz won reelection in a tight race in Texas but Democrats won a Senate seat in Arizona for the first time in 30 years and took control of the House after winning at least 40 seatsIn the meantime the migrant caravan has put Mexico in a difficult position Its newly inaugurated president Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador has criticized Mr Trumps treatment of Mexican migrants as inhumane and racist But he has also accepted that migrants seeking asylum in the US will remain in Mexico a victory for Mr Trump The leftist leader could face strong domestic opposition if he is seen as kowtowing to Mr Trump in implementing the plan details of which remain sketchyWhy should Mexico pay for the migrants especially if their numbers include all undocumented Central Americans in the US and not only those in Tijuana asked Jorge G Castaeda a former Mexican foreign minister in a recent opinion column Its impossible to imagine such a huge capitulation by a socalled leftist government of Mexico to the US he wroteMexicos agreement to the plan delivers a big blow to many migrants who have in the past been allowed to work legally in the US while awaiting the outcome of their asylum cases a process that often takes months or even yearsMeanwhile migrants in Tijuana wait Sitting on the stoop of a shelter by the beach where the US border fence marches

leaders have been operating with dangerous blind spots',https://www.ft.com/content/7f5f53e2-08b1-11e9-9fe8-acdb36967cfc,2019-01-02 16:00:00,This year the tech giant Amazon will be engaged in a delicate political dance in New York The reason In late 2018 the company announced plans to base one of its two new headquarters in Long Island City QueensAmazons leaders probably assumed that the decision would delight locals After all New York mayor Bill de Blasio was so keen to lure the company that he joined forces with his archrival Andrew Cuomo New York governor to offer incentivesBut local residents have not reacted as the city elites or Amazon officials might have expected Instead of welcoming the new highpaying jobs some locals organised community meetings to try to keep Amazon outAs Tania Mattos a leader at Queens Neighborhoods United a group that promotes affordable housing in the area told the FT This deal was not for our communities and if its not for our communities were not going to allow them into our neighbourhoodHow should companies respond The normal answer would be to throw money at local charity projects and hire a few political lobbyists But here is another idea that Jeff Bezos Amazons chief executive might consider along with other tech leaders hire some anthropologistsThis doesnt seem a very Silicon Valley thing to do Men such as Bezos Facebooks Mark Zuckerberg and former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt have amassed vast wealth by handling computer programs and algorithms By contrast anthropologists study the human condition by watching people on the ground rather than using spreadsheetsWhen anthropology emerged as a discipline in the 19th century it tended to study socalled primitive cultures tribes in the Amazon jungle for example That all seems a very long way from a 21stcentury Amazon warehouseBut anthropologys focus has shifted over time These days its adherents are more likely to study modern western societies than remote jungles And what makes the discipline so relevant for thinking about todays technology is its methodologyMost notably anthropologists try to use patient observation without preconception to see how all aspects of culture fit together including those parts that nobody usually talks about The core aim is to see the world through somebody elses eyes and to understand cultural patternsDoing this enables them to comprehend other ways of life But it also delivers a second crucial benefit when you think yourself into the mind of someone who initially seems different or alien you dont just give yourself a chance to understand them you also obtain a fresh perspective on your own cultureOutsiders see things that insiders cannot and vice versa Being an insideroutsider someone who can both deeply empathise with a tribes culture and view it in a wider detached way can bring powerful new awarenessThis is what tech titans desperately need to take on board In 2018 it became painfully clear that they have been operating with some dangerous blind spots they seemingly failed to appreciate the consequences of their innovations on society as a whole in relation to privacy political manipulation and so onCritics claim this is because some techies are greedy arrogant or evil But I suspect that the problem is more to do with tunnel vision they have been so obsessed by innovating operating within an introverted world where everyone speaks the same technical language that they have lost common sense and the broader vision of how their actions affect the wider world or are perceived by itThe problem is not dissimilar to the one that plagued Wall Street before the 2008 financial crash an elite so drunk on its own power that it becomes stuck in a rarefied ghettoSome officials at tech giants are aware of this and are attempting to make changes For several years groups such as Intel and Xerox for example have been quietly consulting anthropologists to help them with their product designBut recently companies including Facebook Uber Spotify and Google have started to do this too When the business anthropology group EPIC held its annual Ethnographic Praxis In Industry Conference in October tickets sold out within 24 hours as technology companies among others scrambled to attendHowever while techies may be ready to hire anthropologists to study consumers it remains to be seen whether they are also prepared to use their newly gained perspective to understand the prejudices and peculiarities of their own tribeHence my advice to Bezos and others try to act more like an anthropologist this year whether in Queens or elsewhere It will not be easy nor will it magically remove your regulatory woes But it might help you understand the societal backlash Or consider this anthropologists are far cheaper to employ than the everswelling army of political lobbyists you have been hiring and probably less controversial If you are a subscriber and would like to

more businesses like Drybar dont want your moneythe paper kind at least Its making things awkward for those who come ill prepared After all you cant give back a hairdo an already dressed salad or the

eitherStarbuckswent cashless at a Seattle location in January and at some pubs in the UK you can no longer get a pint with pound notes The practice of not accepting cash has become popular enough to

silkysmooth voice moved to Miami to start a new life He scored a job in a Floridian pizza shop but found himself missing the girlfriend he had left back home As a Valentines gift he wrote a song in his bedroom for her in which he wistfully croons against upbeat synthesisers He uploaded the song called Me Rehso to YouTube and Spotify It began creeping up Spotifys viral charts in Colombia Chile and Peru which got the attention of Spotifys curators the employees who watch minutebyminute listening data to assemble the companys powerful playlists They unanimously agreed to add it to their playlists such as Verano Forever where Spotifys users lapped it up Week by week Spotify added it to more playlists in its kingdom each with higher followings until two months later the song made it to the holy grail Viva Latino which has the clout to catapult unknown acts into stardom In less than a year and with only one released song Mr Ocean attracted a bidding war among the worlds largest music labels before he signed a plum recording contract with Warner Music The lanky 26yearold skateboarder was soon labelled the new king of reggaeton the popular genre that combines Latin music and hiphopInternet fairy tales like this have circled for some time Justin Bieber was discovered on YouTube a full decade ago But in a business now dominated by online steaming Latin America is having a moment In 2017 the region grew music revenues faster than any other in the world as a young internetsavvy population streamed music in the billions prompting Rolling Stone to declare the year Latins pop takeover Apart from the Danny Oceans of the world few could be happier about the synergy between music streaming and Latin America than Spotify whose stock price and arguably future depend on repeating the same trick in new markets Musician Danny Ocean was discovered on Spotify by Warner Music Latin America  Warner MusicSpotify needs to keep adding subscribers to make Wall Street happy as it battles Apple one of the richest companies in the world to dominate how the world listens to music There is a finite amount of affluent 20somethings in New York or Stockholm to pay Spotify 10 a month for its services However after growing at a torrid clip in Europe and the US investors are betting that Spotify can sign up hundreds of millions of people in what the Swedish company bluntly calls the Rest of the World So far Latin America is the only emerging market where the Spotify model has worked meaningfully a phenomenon which caught senior executives by surprise when it entered Mexico six years ago Spotify became the dominant paid streaming service in Latin America with minimal effort to this day a few dozen employees working out of a Miami WeWork office run the operation for the whole continent No one ever expected it and we didnt even have the resources for it Chile is now one of our fastestgrowing markets and weve never even sent an employee there says Will Page Spotifys director of economics who expects Mexico and Brazil to overtake the UK and Germany in subscriptions Emboldened by the results in Latin America founder Daniel Ek is convinced that he can replicate this across the globe In pitching Spotify to investors before going public in April Mr Ek made grand proclamations about the billions of smartphone owners across the world who do not yet use his music app Were working on launching in some of the biggest markets in the world places like India Russia and Africa he promised Spotify has already made strides in November it debuted in the Middle East while last year it also entered South Africa Israel Vietnam and Romania Scrolling through the Spotify app users now see genres titled Arab and Afro next to Party and SleepDaniel Ek chief executive officer of Spotify  BloombergWall Street has bought into the narrative awarding Spotify a successful stock market debut and optimistic forecasts for its future Across the world excluding China an estimated 6 per cent of people with paymentenabled smartphones pay for Spotify and Morgan Stanley predicts this percentage will double in the next five years as the company reaches 220m paid subscribers By 2023 the bank expects Spotify will have 53m paid subscribers in Asia the Middle East and Africa compared with just 11m this year But that initial enthusiasm has cooled and doubts are creeping in After soaring in the first three months after going public Spotifys shares have been roiled by a broader rout in technology stocks dipping below its opening price on the NYSE Investors have gotten increasingly nervous Morgan Stanley analysts said in October citing a lack of new market launches India amp RussiaIn the US the biggest music market Apple recently ousted Spotify from its throne to become the most popular paid music streaming service And on Spotifys quest for global domination it has already hit a large speedbump India The country has become a bargaining chip in the latest round of jockeying between the tech company and the music industry After months of talks the large labels that control the music business have still not given Spotify the green light to license their songs in the country according to people familiar with the negotiations Now theyre a publicly traded company and they really need to grow says a senior executive at a major label Its our one big piece of leverageWhen asked what they did to conquer Latin America Spotify executives shrug their shoulders We didnt really do very much at all says Mr Page When Spotify entered Mexico six years ago it was still a bootstrapping startup with a barelyfunctional HR department he recalls We had one woman without an office flying around the continent literally We were flying by the seat of our pantsAn economist by day and DJ by night Mr Page gives his interpretation of what happened First licensing was easy because Latin America was still in the throes of piracy which meant labels were happy to do deals In the US the iTunes store had helped thwart piracy but in Mexico a mafiarun piracy business was still thriving Music executives in places such as Canada and Japan were hesitant to trust Spotify resulting in years of painstaking negotiations to launch in those countries However in Mexico we literally took the money says one Mexican executive who was involved in licensing talks at the time At that point we were very happy getting 50000 in a contract the executive says So all of a sudden a company comes offering us 2m and we had no experience with Spotify at the time and we took the money That settled Spotify launched in Mexico in 2013 and then Brazil a year later It was available in all of Latin America before it entered Canada The company had a lot of wind in its sails half the population in Latin America is under 30 which is Spotifys core audience a rising middle class was growing so there were more people able to pay the fee and the Latin market is radiodriven which lent itself well to Spotifys style of inundating users with playlists and suggested songs But most of all executives and analysts attribute the success to word of mouth and endorsements Theyve established the Spotify brand as a premium aspirational brand says Mark Mulligan an analyst at Midia Research This growth has largely just been due to thattheyve done some marketing but not really aggressive marketing Spotify lowered its prices in the region a subscription in Mexico runs for 99 pesos or about 5 a month half the fee in the US While many younger Mexicans baulked at the 1520 price of a new CD they were willing to pay this fee for access to 30m songs The results were both rapid and dramatic Every quarter that we got the reports from Spotify their user base was growing insanely says Kervin Dockendorf who worked for a music publisher in Mexico City at the time Deezer was there Rdio was also there but Spotify destroyed everyone Spotify had a 641 per cent share of the Mexican music streaming market in 2016 well ahead of Google with 123 per cent and Apple with 81 per cent according to the Competitive Intelligence Unit Tseries the Indian music and film producer has shown the potential of the market for music there with a YouTube channel which is among the worlds most successful  FT montageMia Nygren moved in 2014 from Spotifys Stockholm headquarters to So Paulo It felt like everything here was kind of set up for things to work says the Swede People knew about this It was an easy messageWhile CDs were fenced in by geography they had to be pressed and then delivered by truck now anyone with a data plan could participate in the global music industry Just by scooping up the initial group of people in these heavily populated countries who are wealthy have credit cards and had already heard of Spotify it was enough to generate a user base on par with that of small European countries Mexico has grown into Spotifys largest source of listening ahead of the US and UK For many of the biggest western stars such as Adele and Radiohead Mexico City is their number one market on Spotify Spotifys marketing department categorises people into jargony categories upstreamers early adopters laggards opportunists For countries such as Mexico they have now conquered tens of millions of early adopters without spending much money to do so Only about 90 Spotify employees out of 3500 are working in its Latin America division even though the region accounts for a fifth of its customer base Spotify is considering throwing more weight and money at the endeavour In a recent internal presentation about Latin America one section was devoted to the question weve built a castle do we need a moat Spotify has shown that both Latin American stars such as the Colombian singer Shakira and artists from overseas have a huge audience in Mexico  AFPNetflix and Spotify face a similar globalisation challenge but its far cheaper and quicker to build a playlist than a scripted drama series says Mr Mulligan You can program playlists in Brazil easily with a team of Brazilian experts anywhere in the worldThe 20bn dollar question Spotifys current valuation is whether this can be repeated in the Rest of the World Spotify argues it can Countries such as South Africa Indonesia and South Korea also have young internetsavvy consumers ripe for SpotifyThe tides of media and pop culture are slowly but clearly shifting east As of November YouTubes most popular channel is now an Indian record label Netflix has launched a noir television series in Mumbai and chief executive Reed Hastings says the companys next 100m subscribers will come from India Universal Music the worlds largest record label home to Taylor Swift and Drake made a big push in November into AfricaBut there are towering local challenges that have made India a difficult market for western firms from Amazon to Walmart In India Spotify would compete with Apple Amazon and YouTube in addition to local players such as Hungama Gaana and Saavn None of these companies have had success in persuading people to pay for music in India Although 216m people were using streaming services in the country at the end of 2017 only 1m of them actually paid for them according to Midia Research Elsewhere Spotify faces questionable infrastructure rampant piracy and powerful local players such as Anghami in the Middle East In India Spotifys licensing negotiations have reached a stalemate as the major labels pushed back on Spotifys requests to offer free trials for several months in the country according to people briefed on the talks In China which is dominated by Tencent Spotify last year exchanged equity stakes with Tencent Music to enter a foot into the fastgrowing market The stakes for Spotify are high If Mr Ek pulls it off the service could add hundreds of millions of new customers sealing its future If it fails its Cupertinobased rival is already present in more than 100 countries where it will be keen to deepen the iPhones influence Apple has seemingly noticed the Latin craze in October the company launched a Latin playlist Dale Play to its streaming service Spotify will keep looking to shape music culture as it tries to gain subscribers Cultural clout gives Spotify the capacity to build stars of its own A few years ago Danny Ocean might have had a one in a million shot Inigo Zabala chief executive of Warner Music Latin America who later signed him stumbled upon him before he was popular while browsing Spotify He pulls up YouTube on his computer in his Miami office to deliver the current verdict on Me Rehso 12bn views Latin music has always been there but now the streaming world has made it global says Mr Zabala Every two years we had a Latin hit From Buena Vista Social Club to Gypsy Kings to Macarena to Ricky Martin But they were completely random he says Now were thinking about global hits and they are not random They are part of the plan

because they will be taking an official and public stand by voting on monetary policyand will have the opportunity to directly dissent to Federal Open Market Committee decisions and detail their objectionsThe turnover comes at an uncertain time for the central bank when officials generally expect to raise interest rates in 2019 but are unsure how far or fast They project the US economy to stay healthy but cool a bit while noting potential risks from market volatility and slowing global growthThe new group includes Kansas City Fed President Esther George the most hawkish central bank policy maker in Fed lingo because she consistently supports rate rises out of concern that low borrowing costs could fuel financial instability and create inflationary risks At the other end of the Fed policy spectrum is St Louis Fed President James Bullard the most dovish because he opposes any more rate increases as unnecessary and possibly risky to US growthIn between but on the hawkish side are Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren both of whom have recently favored rate increases to prevent the economy from overheating and potentially fueling excessive inflation or asset bubblesHowever three of themMessrs Bullard Evans and Rosengrenhave sharply shifted their policy preferences in the past based on economic developments and could do so

continue to participate in FOMC meetings like all Fed presidentsAll four rate increases in 2018 were supported unanimously by the committeeFed Chairman Jerome Powell and many other central bank officials have indicated they expect to continue raising their benchmark federalfunds rate in the year ahead but arent sure how much or how quicklyThe FOMC lifted the rate in December to a range between 225 and 250 and penciled in two increases in 2019Mr Powell and other officials have stressed however that they will make decisions based on the freshest economic data Thus they will likely provide less verbal guidance than recently on the likely path of rates several months or years ahead perhaps diminishing the spotlight on the four newcomers viewsThe Fed generally expects US economic growth to moderate but theyre not sure by how much Their latest projections show they forecast unemployment to fall further and inflation to remain close to their 2 targetSeveral of the top policy makers have said they believe the fedfunds rate is still low enough to stimulate economic activity and they want to raise it at least to a neutral point that neither spurs nor slows growth But they are not sure where neutral lies and their estimates vary from 25 to 35Mr Rosengren spent much of 2018 saying he was inclined to move rates beyond the neutral point over time to a level high enough to restrain growth He also flagged his belief the Fed would need to raise rates more than many of his colleagues expectedMr Evans spent the closing months of the year making a similar argumentBoth have made reasonably strong cases for hiking beyond neutral and thats the key debate for the Fed in 2019 said Michael Hanson economist with TD SecuritiesMs George is likely to support further rate rises and she could be a leading voice for more increases even when her colleagues are less sure that is the way to go Ms George has consistently suggested interest rates should move higher for several yearsMr Bullard appears the most likely of the four to cast a dissenting vote if the Fed does raise rates as projected He says that with inflation low and stable there is nothing pushing the Fed toward tighter monetary policy Hes also worried higher rates could trigger a recession at some pointThe potential for shifting data is really driving the direction of policy for the next year and new

Schoen Clinic is offering the ultimate luxury for the postoperative rich privacyA suite of rooms can be accessed by private lift ensuring patients and their visitors can enter and leave the hospital unobserved Christopher Schoen 30yearold scion of the German hospital groups founding family said If we have a more VIP patient or a patient travelling from abroad they can have this entire floorJust four months after the specialist spine and orthopaedic clinics largely unpublicised launch part of the space is already occupied about once every two weeksand Id say that will build over time he saidUndeterred by the uncertainties of Brexit some of the biggest international health brands are setting out their stall in the UK capital determined to grab a slice of the largest concentration of paying patients in EuropeThe Lanserhof Spa long an Alist staple for its regenerative treatments has teamed up with the Arts Club in Mayfair and will next year open its first branch outside mainland Europe while the Cleveland Clinic a US hospital group renowned for providing some of the best care in the US will soon open its first UK facility in the upmarket district of BelgraviaThey are set to vie with far longerestablished healthcare brands for the loyalty and cash of customers seeking the ultimate in clinical care combined with a precious aura of exclusivityWhy the London healthcare market is boomingLaing amp Buisson which provides analysis of the private healthcare market reported last week that the central London selfpay market was estimated to be growing at around 25 per cent per annum Keith Pollard executive chairman said the new entrants into the market would put pressure on HCA the hospital group which currently dominates the London private healthcare sector but also leading NHS teaching hospitals such as the Royal Marsden which generates about 100m from private patients The business will have to come from somewhere he addedMr Schoen chief executive of the Schoens London branch said that before deciding to invest in the UK capital the group looked atMoscow we looked at Warsaw we looked at Barcelona Madrid Paris but came to the conclusion that for us as a company London would be the best location because it has the highest private market in all of EuropeAbout 18 months ago the group took over a hospital for eating disorders in Birmingham and it will shortly open a day treatment centre for mental health problems in Chelsea Mr Schoen was unambiguous about his ambition We would like to disrupt the London healthcare market he said Surgeon David Sweetnam at the Schoen Clinic  Charlie BibbyFTIn contrast to some established hospital groups all of Schoens doctors are directly employed by the clinic in which it has invested 42m Other elements it hopes will differentiate it from competitors include a system for continuous monitoring of individual doctors performance with the data available to prospective patients and its decision to staff its wards at night with intensivists fully qualified consultants who specialise in the care of critically ill patients rather than junior doctorsColin Natali head of spine surgery at the clinic suggested that the fight to dominate the private healthcare market was a zerosum game There are only so many people that can be ill and this is going to alter the whole landscapeBecause why wouldnt you come to the bestMayfairs mix of medical and members clubsMeanwhile the Lanserhof group is carving out a niche away from the citys traditional medical district through its partnership with the Arts Club a membersonly club in Mayfairs Dover Street Christian Harisch chief executive of the Lanserhof group said We dont do wellness we are not a wellness centre we are medical But the service on offer is a million miles from a neighbourhood doctors office or the highestend gym At a site in the former Dover Street Market currently undergoing a 50m refurbishment the sporty will be offered the ultimate in motivational tools an MRI that allows them to see the state of their muscles before beginning an exercise regimen and then again a year later so you can see yourself whats happening to your body said Mr HarischThe Arts Club in MayfairA key distinguishing feature will be two cryotherapy chambers where the strong of will and heart a pretreatment cardiac check is compulsory will be exposed to temperatures up to 120C below zeroYou lose up to 800 calories in one treatment of three minutesthe same calories as if you go running for half an hour in Hyde Park he saidNot just topnotch clinicians but an array of other support staff will be available as befits the cashrich timepoor lifestyle of its target market He said We also offer a clothes service a butler service so that you dont need to bring your own sportswear with you everything is stored in the clubyou could say Im in the City Im going to a meeting and I dont want to take my bag with me all dayAfter training you go to the onsite hairdresser you have a wash and blow and so you just jump into the next meetingand nobody will see that you were just on the treadmill for an hour he addedQuality of NHStrained doctors is big attractionAlthough the average patient of the UKs universal freetouse National Health Service would struggle to afford the facilities of these new brands the quality of NHStrained doctors is a clear attraction for those seeking to gain a foothold in the London market Brian Donley chief executive of Cleveland Clinic London said a key lure for his notforprofit group which prides itself on being led by physicians was Londons reputation as the leading city for healthcare innovation and healthcare talentwere here to learn from the UK healthcare market he saidSome of the best that exists is in the NHS and the group is exploring many different possibilities and avenues of how we can collaborate with the NHS around research around education around clinical care he addedBack at the Lanserhof Mr Harisch suggested that however deep clients pockets the search for a healthier life is a universal leveller The people who come to usmay have two planes three ships 10 cars but all of them have only one life and they want to have this life as long as possible in a great condition he added

years later euro coins and notes came into circulation Eight additional countries have joined the currency over the following years and seven more could join once they meet the criteriaAfter 20 years the euro has been a successful project measured by its adoption and supportThreequarters of people in the eurozone are in favour of the euro the highest since 2004 seemingly dispelling the impression of rising antieuro sentiment in many countriesYet all is not well with the euro as even its most ardent advocates acknowledge The crisis of the past decade revealed defects in its architecturethat member countries have been trying to address Reform is slow and the gap between rich and poor member states remains large A global currencyThe euro has become the second most important currency in the world It accounts for 36 per cent of global payments and20 per cent of all central banks foreign reserves second only to the dollarThe euro is used by 340m people in 19 countries Another 175m people outside the eurozone either use it or peg their own currency to itAbout 38 per cent of the eurozone population has not known any other currency in their adult lifeThe process of mentally converting to a countrys former currency is a thing of the pastIn all countries of the eurozone a majority are in favour of the euroA promising first decadeIn line with expectations the creation of the euro boosted intraeurozone capital flows Crossborder claims of euroarea banks rose from below 1tn in 1998 to close to 10tn in 2008 according to the Bank for International SettlementsDetailed data from the ECB shows that bank lending to other banks in the eurozone increased to about one quarter of all banktobank lending in 2008 Bank lending to businesses in other eurozone countries increased to a peak of 53 per cent of all bank lendingto businesses in March 2009Intraeuro area trade more than doubled between 1999 and 2008 but it remains largely stable as a share of total trade largely because of rising trade flows with Asia Crisis and a challenge to surviveWhen the euroarea crisis hit capital flows were reversed as markets grew concerned about whether the eurozone would start to break up Many investors reached the conclusion that the only way out for crisishit countries was for them to exit from it said Mario Draghi president of the ECB in May Fearing redenomination into lowervalue currencies investors sold off domestic assetsBut eurozone member states took various measures to keep together In 2010 The European Financial Stability Facility was created as a temporary crisis tool to provide financial assistance to Ireland Portugal and Greece providing total loan commitments of 175bn Later on a permanent sovereign bailout fund was created with a maximum lending capacity of 500bn the European Stability MechanismToday a large gap between rich and poorThe recovery brought some convergence in inflation and interest rates but this was less so in general economic and social terms particularly among the old euro membersDaniel Gros director of CEPS a European politics thinktankshowed in a recent paper thatthe newer eurozone members of central and eastern Europe have been catching up in terms of income per capita but the north has diverged from the south since the start of the financial crisisThe same divergence can be observed for indicators such as real wages investment and productivityAccording to the OECD last year a worker in Germany or Belgium was able to produce about 70 of output in an hour about double the value in Greece and Portugal after correcting for price differencesCountries with low initial productivity have had consistently lower total factor productivity growth and experienced a sharper slowdown over recent years says an IMFreport on eurozone convergence Unfinished businessSince its creation member states have taken many steps to improve the eurozones resilience to crises including creating a banking union and capital market union Yet both remain incompleteThe lack of deeper financial integration leaves smaller banks largely exposed to their home economy and prone to cut lending hampering any recovery during an economic downturn But if there are crossborder banks that operate in all parts of the union they can offset any losses made in the recessionhit region with gains in another and can continue to provide credit to sound borrowers said Mr Draghi in MayBrusselsproposals to deepen Europes monetary unionrange from creating a European monetary fund to a European minister of economy and financeAnd in December the EU agreed to strengthen the ESM and create a eurozone budget in principle if not yet in detail It is a harbinger of change to come in the next two decades of the euroThe budget plan was minuscule in size and still completely inadequate said Erik Nielsen group chief economistat UniCredit in a noteBut Rome was not built in a day and so long as we get even the tiniest steps in the right direction hope remains

rightwithout alienating customersis crucial Credit cards account for an average of about 14 of revenue at Citigroup Bank of America JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo according to an analysis by Autonomous ResearchJPMorgan executives debated whether to stop letting cardholders pool together points from multiple cards according to people familiar with the matter JPMorgans Ms Rogers said the bank has no current plans to stop cardholders from pooling pointsCitigroup plans to cap the number of times each year its Prestige cardholders who stay at hotels four consecutive nights can get the fourth night free A Citigroup spokeswoman says the bank is focused on fostering longterm relationships with cardholders AmEx has been introducing cards with fewer signup bonus points An AmEx spokeswoman said the company is offering other bonus options such as statement credits based on restaurant chargesThe banks face rewards enthusiasts who take pride in wringing the most benefits from each card For example many cards offer tiered rewards where only certain purchases qualify for the most generous cashback terms Thats no obstacle for customers like Tony Rodriguez a 34yearold PhD student in Knoxville TennMr Rodriguez and his girlfriend Whitney Forbes use the AmEx Blue Cash Preferred card for groceries earning 6 back on up to 6000 of purchases a year and for gas which earns 3 They useDiscover Financial Servicesit card and a Chase Freedom card for purchases that qualify for 5 cash back Those items change every quarter so Mr Rodriguez keeps a list on a slip of paper in his wallet Everything else goes on their Citi Double Cash card which gives 1 back on all purchases and 1 back when they pay off the billMr Rodriguez who is studying industrial engineering began shopping around for cards about 2 years ago Soon I realized theres all sorts of free money he saidBig banks pushed into credit cards after the financial crisis to offset a slowdown in their trading and mortgage units JPMorgan and Citigroup poached top executives from AmEx which made premium rewardswith a high annual feeits calling card for decades and copied the strategyRewards competition began to heat up in 2013 when Discover launched the it card A year later Citigroup created the Double Cash card which also offered hefty rewards at no annual fee Many banks view the rewards as a way to reach younger consumers and turn them into bigger clients by selling them other products including wealth management services as they graduate to bigger jobs and paychecks While credit card openings have

compared with roughly 12 to 17 on more standard rewards cards For the next couple of years banks competed to come up with increasingly flashy cards The frenzy reached a peak when JPMorgan introduced Sapphire Reserve in August 2016 offering 100000 bonus points for consumers who charged 4000 in the first three months three points per dollar spent on travel and dining and a 300 credit on travel purchases among other perksJPMorgans Ms Rogers said two years in the bank had seen record retention levels topping 90 for its Sapphire Reserve customersAt an investor conference AmEx called it a full frontal assault to its longstanding Platinum card Despite Sapphire Reserves 450 annual fee customers flocked to it so quickly that JPMorgan ran out of the metal cards and reached its firstyear goal for new accounts in two weeksWithin a few months JPMorgan had misgivings about the cards costs It halved the bonus points to 50000 and dialed back inbranch promotion of the card The Sapphire Reserve card proved great for business for Brian Kelly who started the rewards website The Points Guy as a hobby in 2010 while working in human resources atMorgan StanleyHis website helped spawn an ecosystem of rewards fanatics across the internet who swap tips about card deals The banks covet his favorable reviews of their cards and often turn to the site to promote them In December Mr Kelly hosted a card awards ceremony in New York City sponsored by JPMorgan Wells Fargo and othersJPMorgan had approached Mr Kelly in spring 2016 to ask how his company would market an upscale card it had in the works He learned more details about the card which turned out to be the Sapphire Reserve a couple of months later while on vacation in Tanzania with his parents The bank agreed to pay The Points Guy each time readers visiting the website started an application and received the card The site earned millions of dollars from the card in the months after it was introducedDespite misgivings about the rewards programs banks are still competing for the customers who use them and chipping away at rewards is riskyJames Fuller of Ellijay Ga used to charge about 30000 a year to his Starwood Hotels amp Resorts personal and business credit cards He and his wife Allison used the points to stay for free at hotels in 17 states where they ran halfmarathonsThen Mr Fuller a 28yearold highschool teacher and smallbusiness owner saw on online forums that the hotel which was recently acquired byMarriott International Incand AmEx might scale back the cards rewards Sure enough Marriott and AmEx made the cards points significantly less valuable last year when redeemed for hotel stays Mr Fuller canceled the business card and slashed his spending on his personal card to about 300 a month from a typical 2500Mr Fuller now puts most of his purchases on JPMorgan credit cardsWe feel confident that the majority of our current SPG AmEx card members will get more value out of the cards new value proposition said an AmEx spokeswoman A Marriott spokesman said the card remains popular and is a tremendous value propositionRob Broadhurst who lives in West Sacramento Calif saw on an online forum that JPMorgan planned to end price protection on Sapphire Reserve In late March he and his wife Katie Anderson hurried to buy a new fridge for 1599 Weeks later when they found an online ad for the same model for 1399 they rushed to submit a claim for the 200 difference and soon got a check in the mailJPMorgan removed the cards price protection feature in August It was definitely a bummer said Mr Broadhurst 34 The couple still use Sapphire Reserve though because they redeem the points for travelBanks have been lowering signup bonuses on premium cards since 2017 the year after JPMorgan introduced Sapphire Reserve The bonuses averaged 66000 points in 2016 before dropping to 58000 in 2017 and 44000 in the first seven months of 2018 according to consulting firm SimonKucher amp PartnersThat is in large part because of concerns many card issuers have about gamers who open cards with rich signup bonuses and then stop using them once they have tapped out the early rewards US credit card attrition rates a measure of how many cards are closed each year reached 15 in 2017 up from less than 10 the year before according to MercatorThe issue was flagged by AmExs thenchief Kenneth Chenault in 2017 when he was asked at an investor conference about competition from Sapphire Reserve Card companies that are driving the stakes up he said are also getting people who are gamersIn mid2017 Krishnaswamy Narayanaswamy who works in data analytics and is 54 years old and his wife signed up for JP Morgans Sapphire Preferred which included a 50000point signup bonus Then the couple based in Vancouver Wash wanted to ditch the card to avoid paying an annual feebut closing the account which was in his wifes name would have hurt her credit score by reducing her socalled available credit They also didnt want to open a brandnew account which could have impacted her credit score in other ways like lowering her credit limit So she transferred to another JPMorgan card that has no annual fee the Chase Freedom a move that didnt technically require closing or opening an accountBanks are still grappling with how to wean consumers off the easy perksBarclaysPLC this past spring introduced a credit card without a signup bonus and instead offered up to 25000 bonus miles each year to consumers who charged at least 25000 on the card Rachana Bhatt a managing director at Barclays US credit card division said in an interview at the time the bank hoped to appeal to longterm customers with a sustainable offerThe Points Guy website now owned by Red Ventures gave the card a lukewarm reviewThe card failed to take off By early October the bank stopped taking applicationsThe card represented a disruptive approach in the industryrewarding customers for ongoing loyalty rather than just one upfront bonus

20:51:48,Car buyers looking to skip the dealership and buy a set of wheels online are starting to find more optionsMore auto dealers as well as startups are offering direct sales through their websites latching onto the clicktobuy culture of online retailingMany car shoppers say they loathe visiting dealerships unsettled by the pushy sales tactics haggling over price and lengthy process it takes to close a purchase With online sales much of that aggravation can be avoided say dealers offering the service although in most cases customers dont get to test drive the specific vehicle they want to purchase before it arrivesThe shift to more online sales could change the dynamics of automotive retail allowing dealers to expand their geographic reach and make it easier for customers to crossshop stores based on price retailers and industry analysts sayMost of the growth in online sales today is from used vehicles marketed through new startups likeCarvana Co CVNA 459and Shift Technologies Inc Used vehicles unlike new vehicles dont have to be sold through franchised car dealers allowing for a moreopen market These startups let customers browse and purchase preowned cars on their websites and arrange to have them delivered to their home or business in many markets across the USCarvana which was founded in 2012 is now delivering cars in 85 US markets The Phoenixbased company says it sold nearly 66400 vehicles this year through the third quarter up from about 44000 for all of 2017 and roughly 230 vehicles five years agoAs customers become more comfortable with buying bigticket items online from furniture to large electronics more dealerships are introducing directdelivery service for new vehicles Some will deliver a car anywhere free while others charge by distance after a certain number of milesThere is little industry data on how many cars are sold online or how many dealers offer online car buying in part because the market is young Also the definition of an online sale is complicated by the fact that car shoppers sometimes process only part of their purchase online Still dealers say in recent years more consumers are choosing to buy vehicles online and dealers are increasingly offering the optionEveryone loves Amazon and its pushing us to do more said Brendan Harrington chief operating officer of Penske Motor Group a newcar dealership chain with stores in California and Texas People now expect the same thing from the car businessPenske two years ago launched an online express store that allows car buyers to complete most of the transaction online including securing financing and then arrange for home delivery within hours of completing the order The buyer signs the final paperwork only once the car is received Those with a tradein can lock in a value online and have the vehicle picked up when the new one is deliveredDirectdelivery sales which include online and other purchases where the buyer never sets foot in the dealership account for about onequarter of the 2500 cars Penske sells each month Mr Harrington said the doorstepdelivery service adds to his costs but he started the service because Los Angeles traffic made some of his stores difficult to reach and he wanted to expand his customer base geographicallyThe car business has been a laggard in online retailing mostly because purchasing a vehicle is a complex highdollar transaction that is regulated differently in each stateButTesla Inchas had success selling directly to customers and that has helped nudge car retailers in that direction The electriccar maker has demonstrated that there are consumers willing to purchase vehicles costing 75000 or more without having driven them firstRobert Rivers who recently used Carvana to buy a car said he was drawn to the simplicity of an online transaction and the companys noquestionsasked return policyMr Rivers ordered a 2017 Kia Forte off the website this month and three days later a large truck dropped the car off at his California home But after living with it for a few days he decided he wanted a more fully loaded model so Carvana picked up the unwanted car up and replaced it with a newer Kia ForteI didnt have to deal with the sales guys said Mr Rivers 39 years old who works for a beverage distributor I filled out everything onlineMany consumers already use the internet extensively for their vehicle shopping spending about 13 hours on average online researching and browsing models prior to making a purchase according to a JD Power study released this year That compares to 3 hours at the dealership the study of carbuying habits foundEarl Stewart Toyota in North Palm Beach Fla offers online carbuying and home delivery Stu Stewart the dealerships general manager said he introduced the service sensing that customers who took the lead doing their research online would want to maintain control throughout the entire transaction Amazoncom Incoffers consumers the ability to research vehicles by specific models and years on its website but people cannot purchase a vehicle directly from the internet retailer State franchise laws require auto makers to sell their vehicles through their existing dealership network making it difficult for Amazon and similar companies to break into newcar retailingFor customers nervous about buying a car online Carvana offers a liberal return policy arranging to pick up the unwanted vehicle within seven days free of charge and with a full refund Shift which is based in San Francisco will drop off the selected car for a test drive and complete the sale on the spot if the customer is satisfiedFor the vast majority of dealerships instore sales will continue to be the main way they sell cars Delivering cars to customers can get

withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement and reimposed sanctions on Iran Ms Joneydi filed a lawsuit in cooperation with other ministries against the US at the International Court of Justice ICJ and Iran won What the US administration has done to the Iranian people is illegitimate from a legal point of view and more illegitimate from a moral point of view she told the Financial Times in her first interview with a foreign media group Ms Joneydis rise is the result of mounting public pressure on Irans leaders to appoint women to top jobs with people voicing discontent over a rise in the number of female university students not leading to more women in senior official roles She is one of Irans 12 vicepresidents two of whom are women In the ICJ case Ms Joneydi helped Iran argue that the US reimposition of sanctions violated a 1955 Treaty of Amity between the two countries that encouraged trade investment and closer economic relations On October 3 the Haguebased ICJ handed a victory to Tehran by ordering Washington to ensure its sanctions did not hit certain forms of trade including humanitarian aid food and medicine The provisional ruling cannot be enforced and the US immediately terminated the treaty saying aid was never a target of its sanctions But the ICJ win was nonetheless heartening for Iran whose economy has been hit by the sanctions The measures began to affect oil exports last month and weakened the rial by about 50 per cent against the dollar this year This has been an injustice to Iranian people who see their economy and welfare weakened while even their access to basic needs is hit said Ms Joneydi The US knows that it cannot ignore the ICJs rulings It may not be the perfect option for Iran butit has been useful The ruling had helped in Irans efforts to capitalise on an EU decision to stick with the nuclear accord she said Without it she suggested European countries might not have been willing to set up a sanctionsbusting payments channel for trade with Iran due to be launched in the coming weeks In addition Ms Joneydi said Iran was using the ICJ verdict in its negotiations with foreign companies and banks that are reviewing their ties with the country In a country where conservative ideologues are vying with moderates for primacy Ms Joneydi is seen as a nonpartisan pragmatist who is committed to defending Irans sovereignty She was born into a middleclass family in the town of Babol on the shores of the Caspian Sea and moved to Tehran as a teenager to study law at the University of Tehran where she was the only female student among her peers at masters and PhD levels In 2002 she received a postdoctoral research scholarship at Harvard in the US She still teaches at the University of Tehran and is proud that most of her students are women This means growth It is the ultimate satisfaction for me to see todays young and educated generation push for the countrys progress she said I do not claim that I represent them but I belong to this class of educated opinionated people who believe in consistent improvements After president Hassan Rouhani was reelected in a landslide last year on a reform agenda Ms Joneydi received a call from his office She imagined it was something to do with a legal case thanks to her expertise in international commercial arbitration But instead it was a job offer I ended up here by destiny My life was dominated by my academic profession as well as being a legal practitioner she said I was never a politician and I am still not linked to any political group I intentionally remain an independent person because in my positionwe need to settle disputes impartially between various state organisations Being a woman in a maledominated system brings more challenges she said But she has been joined by others in the top ranks of the Iranian elite the head of Iran Air is a woman as is the managing director of the National Petrochemical Company and a new board member of the National Iranian Oil Company Beyond fighting sanctions Ms Joneydi has reestablished the rights of religious minorities to be members of city councils and is working on a comprehensive plan to increase government transparency I want to push for the rule of law at home and in international relations and help promote civil rights and individual freedoms she says Our constitution has not been properly implemented yet and there is a lot of room for some articles such as those on peoples rights and freedoms to be fulfilled But like many educated middle class Iranians she opposes any sudden policy changes that could lead to instability and unrest This may be desired by those who impose sanctions but would put Iran at the risk of turning into another Iraq Syria or Afghanistan she says I want our 200 years of experience in struggling for the rule of law to bear desirable outcomes in a mature way even if the process is difficult or slow CV Laya Joneydi Born 1968 in Babol Iran Education 19861990

against him in favor of his Washington insider opponent Hillary Clinton Even after winning that election Trump has consistently claimed that he is the victim of disloyal allies in his own

and create a contingency plan to delay it.,http://fortune.com/2018/12/15/amazon-volatility-contigency-plan-leadership/,2018-12-15 14:00:03,During an allhands meeting at Amazons Seattle headquarters CEO Jeff Bezos was recently asked about the technology giants future in light of recent retail industry bankruptcies Amazon is not too big to fail Bezos reportedly replied In fact I predict one day Amazon will fail Amazon will go bankrupt If we start to focus on ourselves instead of focusing on our customers that will be the beginning of the end he added We have to try and delay that day for as long as possible Considering the potential downsidesand even the outright failureof a business is one of the most prudent steps a leader can take Few do so however which is what makes Bezoss frank forecast so startling and unusual Senior leadersmost of whom dont enjoy the untouchable status that Bezos does within Amazonrarely have the courage to assert such things Yet what Bezos told his assembled employees reflects the historical reality Most highly successful businesses eventually fail and in fact have failed faster and faster in recent decades In 1964 the average tenure of SampP 500 companies was 33 years by 2016 it was 24 years By 2027 it is forecasted to be just a dozen years for Americas most profitable and prominent corporations If these are the facts facing publicly listed companies with the largest market value why are so few leaders of such firms willing to acknowledge the truth Doing so does not magically make the probability of outright failure any greater Leaders mistakenly believe that it could raise doubts about an organizations strategy or mission harm the morale of the workforce orworst of all from a leaders perspectiveinduce skepticism about the managements overall competency Despite the potential risks more leaders should face up to the real possibility of their business tanking If they do so they stand to gain real benefits First by listing potential types of failures a management team can mitigate them For example firms can fall off the SampP 500 for any of the following reasons either individually or in combination flawed and inflexible strategy customer data breach aggressive technological disruptor sudden shift in political or societal trends unexpected or onerous regulations and unethical or illegal leadership behavior Not all of these can receive equal attention but by prioritizing them on a simple evaluative frameworksuch as financial market share or reputationalthe management team can then drill down on those they are most concerned about Second in listing and prioritizing these potential failures early warning indicators and triggers can also be identified and monitored Constantly looking for such identifiable triggers reduces the probability that a strategic surprise will catch a business off guard and being prepared for these provides a competitive edge over market peers In addition the process will identify potential knowledge gaps that should be filled with customer surveys market research and horizon scanninga commonly used foresight method that identifies nascent challenges relevant to a specific business Third preparing for the worst informs enterprisewide or unittailored contingency plans that can be developed far in advance and initiated as needed when early warning indicators arise During an unfolding crisis planning gets worse roles and responsibilities become less clear and interoffice dynamics become more toxic By developing these plans a business will be able to more quickly deploy its focus resources and personnel to stave off these foreseeable barriers to recovery Finally any management team that openly considers failure also helps to create an environment in which employees feel both comfortable and empowered to voice the localized yet consequential risks they encounter day to day The frontlines most immediately and directly experience business challenges If these employees feel that voicing their concerns is pointless or will be diminished by senior leaders they will not take the personal risks to do so There are any number of exercises that can help a management team think through some of the pathways toward their company failing These include premortem analysis envisioning potential scenarios and brainstorming downsides to different plans of action Most important however is taking the time to collectively develop a cognitive blueprint that realistically imagines failure is shared with the entire organization and compels a change in behavior and in processes This should not be perceived as an attack on a leaders ego or an injection of pessimism into the workplace but rather an embrace of the volatility and the need for constant change that all businesses face and will increasingly face in the near future Micah Zenko is the director of research and learning at McChrystal Group and author of Red Team How to

anything please attribute to CNBC and Christine TanChristine Tan Suranjan the last few years have been rather challenging for PampG The company has been undergoing a restructuring process trying to cut costs amid flagging sales How has that affected your operations in Asia Pacific and IMEA the regions youre in charge ofMagesvaran Suranjan These regions have done fairly well and the APAC region has shown tremendous growth over the last three years in terms of how were serving the consumers more and more You can read that in shares and therefore what we have done here is actually invest Weve invested to grow and the growth is comingChristine Tan So youre still upbeat about growth in this part of the worldMagesvaran Suranjan Oh absolutelyChristine Tan Whats driving itMagesvaran Suranjan By 2030 60 percent of the worlds spending is going to be here The population demographic trends are here and we are poised just right I believe to be able to innovate into these phases and we will grow We will grow were growing now and we will grow in the next 10 yearsChristine Tan PampG relies a lot on China for its products and raw materials to manufacture and package many of its brands like Head and Shoulders Downy OralBs toothpaste and toothbrushes How is the company grappling with President Trumps latest round of tariffs against ChinaMagesvaran Suranjan First of all we aim to serve our consumers as locally as possible So most of our manufacturing is local Our supply chains are global in terms of ecosystems and therefore it doesnt impact us much We obviously believe in free trade and that allows better competition and a fairer competition but we are not impacted as muchChristine Tan But you still do import some raw materials and products from ChinaMagesvaran Suranjan Absolutely absolutelyChristine Tan What are these raw materials And is the company looking to find alternative sourcesMagesvaran Suranjan We have multiple supply chains around the world and we leverage the supply chains optimally We have to just from a business continuity standpoint And in China as with any other supply chain its similarChristine Tan Ultimately this means of course higher prices in the end for the consumer How much can you pass on these costs without hurting demandMagesvaran Suranjan Im not sure this will translate to higher prices if at all Again our supply chains are fairly local and therefore we dont see that much of an impact to our business model Our business model at the end of the day is going to be innovation superior value to consumers and superior goto market All that should not change and will not changeChristine Tan Where do you see profit margins here in this part of the worldMagesvaran Suranjan I think it will keep getting better as we do better at serving the consumer We aim to be able to premiumize our products We aim to serve in the categories with broader benefit space and as we do that I expect us to grow top line as well as bottom lineChristine Tan Whats the biggest headwind youre facing here in AsiaPacificMagesvaran Suranjan As a global company itll be foreign exchange and commodities These are the standard two And if one isnt spiking the other one is and we have to have a business model thats able to cater to either of them or sometimes both together as headwindsChristine Tan How do you deal with you know fluctuating currencies when youre expanding your footprint in so many countries here in the regionMagesvaran Suranjan The best way is to be able to innovate because when one innovates one is able to premiumize the portfolio And the second is productivity In this business in a fast moving consumer goods business productivity is paramount And this is finding better ways cheaper ways to do the same thing and do things betterChristine Tan Here in Asia in particular there is rising competition You have to battle your rivals to name a few Unilever Amway LOreal Shiseido You have a product portfolio of 65 brands across 10 product categories How are you fighting for market shareMagesvaran Suranjan There is a standard the consumer will pick Shes the boss and shell pick based on superiority who is the most famous in the store and how she hears about our products And the brand thats able to achieve the three the best will at the end of the day serve their consumer best and be the choiceChristine Tan So does that mean you constantly have to revamp your product lineup just to make your products more compellingMagesvaran Suranjan The consumer is evolving The trends are evolving so fast Just to keep up with her we have to be able to innovate And this is whats so magical about what we do that you cannot stand still You cannot stand still on innovation you cannot stand still from a cost standpoint and you cannot stand still from a communication standpoint You know how we used to hear about products years back TV Today its digital and even digital is pass now its mobile You have to be mobile friendly as a first line of communicating to the consumerChristine Tan You talk about the consumer person in a feminine form Why is thatMagesvaran Suranjan Most of our products are for the female Weve got Gillette awesome product and thats one to the male I believe the male part of the portfolio can expand and should expand But today most of our portfolio serves the female consumerChristine Tan So youve just recently launched this ECenter 20 today What exactly is it all aboutMagesvaran Suranjan This is our latest and flagship on innovation centers And this is focused on digital innovation we know this is the future and specifically what we hope to achieve here and learn from is areas of iSupply the future of supply chains of eanalytics data science and data hubs  ecommerce These are three pillars of the ECenter 20Christine Tan What does all of this say about the retail of the future What are you gearing up forMagesvaran Suranjan I mean just look around us this is fast evolving The way they shop the shops in the traditional format and more importantly the way the shopper will shop in future formats especially online is something that we have to learnChristine Tan How will retail shopping change in the futureMagesvaran Suranjan I think its going to be much more personalized its going to be much more of what one does in ones spare time as one is doing other things Its one thats going to be direct direct engagement with the brand versus a mass engagement The second aspect is going to be the way of advertising before they get to the store and how to direct their attention to the brands in the news The third is delivery Who wants to lug shopping baskets anymore You want to be able to pick and you want it to come to your house An idea is that it happens within 30 minutesChristine Tan This data analytics that youre talking about is it also a way for PampG to figure out what new products to launch in the future as they get closer to the consumerMagesvaran Suranjan Absolutely I think first of all identifying what are the needs before one even knows what ones need are And then secondly as we think about different products for different consumer segments is how well be able to position the product uniquely to that consumerChristine Tan PampG is fast expanding into the health care OTC consumer or over the counter market The company recently did a deal with Merck to take over its consumer healthcare business Is consumer healthcare the next big area of growth for the companyMagesvaran Suranjan I believe it is an area of growth I dont know the specifics of it since the Merck acquisition will only take effect on December 1st but its certainly an interesting area when we look at where the demographics are going and how we canChristine Tan And where are the demographics growingMagesvaran Suranjan At the end of the day the population is aging There are millennials and the new age population there are trends in the naturals This is a wide area to play in in this areaChristine Tan What can you tell us about the tastes of the millennial consumer How do you appeal to this younger generation of shoppersMagesvaran Suranjan Its certainly different And this is one of the trends that we have to get with and in front of Their shopping experience to start with is different Mass marketing versus onetoone marketing The stores that the millennials will shop versus the past is different We have to figure out how to serve these in the places where they shop in the places where they can be communicated with and then it goes to innovation as well innovationChristine Tan Is it all about hiring millennial employees just to get the thinking rightMagesvaran Suranjan We will be hiring because at PampG theres a flow of talent and our recruiting classes are significant Weve got great innovation on that front tooChristine Tan Are you coming up with specific products just for the millennial marketMagesvaran Suranjan Not that I know of I think the extension of our brands at the end of the day we believe in the strength of our brands appealing to a broad set of consumers and I believe our brands have still got legs to be able to serve for millennials to the to the later stages in lifeChristine Tan Suranjan just down the road from here PampG launched an innovation center in 2014 which houses some 500 scientists and engineers What signature products have you developed from the center thats reached commercializationMagesvaran Suranjan This is a center that weve invested half a billion dollars Weve got some of the most amazing people scientists PhDs the best of the best Im so inspired What theyve been creating and theres so much more in the pipeline are things like the Pantene 3minute Miracle The latest one we just launched about three weeks ago was the Febreze micro mist with the finest mist one can get in a product out of a spray We are working on skin technologies out of this center and theres many more The ones Ive described are the ones in the market right nowChristine Tan Its interesting you talk about how there are 14 smells that are present in this center I want to know what this is all aboutMagesvaran Suranjan You have to see this I mean it is a stateoftheart facility where youve got rooms that we can use as labs And you may know this there are certified noses and these are folks that can discern the most minute of smell differences And youd want to certify the list weve got a number of those folks here these are people who we formally call the noses here at the Singapore innovation centerChristine Tan How exactly do you certify for a noseMagesvaran Suranjan I dont know But I do know that its a long lengthy and training process over many years Im always inspired when I see them Ive always wanted to test how many they can really do but I trust that theyre the most discerning noses in the worldChristine Tan These products that you come up with at this innovation center are they mostly developed for the global markets or for AsiaPacificMagesvaran Suranjan Itll be for the global markets We look at the consumers broadly and then we will customize it as needed for the local segment Of course well launch in a specific market first we will learn and depending on the consumer segment it may have an applicability thats broaderChristine Tan Im thinking that the idea is that whatever works in Asia can work anywhere else in the world Has Asia become the global litmus testMagesvaran Suranjan It has in some products and for some other products not necessarily The tastes are different There are certain characteristics and the need for fragrances is different But that said the products like say the Tide pods is universal Everybody wants an easier way to do their laundry The micro mist in Febreze whether its Olays skin mask these are all universally applicable and are universal needs that I think these brands can serve around the worldChristine Tan So what are you working on nextMagesvaran Suranjan Goodness our pipeline as you can imagine is rather full What we have is looking at how we can appeal to two segments of the population to what I like to call the boomers and the millennials the new entrants to the market Different needs youve got the aging populations specific need of skin creams of innovational packaging you still do laundry but you dont want to lug a 3 kilogram liquid bottle with you Then with the millennials and new entrants to the market in the future their needs are very different The shopping experience and the products that theyre looking for are different Theyre willing to try different stuff They no longer look to their parents for inspiration to say Well my mum used it so Ill use it as well Rather its different So we have to cater to that and find products that are able to uniquely appeal to themChristine Tan Well consumers are naturally attracted to the packaging of a product What are you doing on this front to entice the shopper to buy your productsMagesvaran Suranjan The Asian consumer is certainly a very discerning consumer on packaging More so than anyone else that I have seen They require an innovation cycle that is almost independent of the product the juice within if you may And what we need is greater lightweight products what we need are products that are easy to carry easy to ship by ecommerce more vibrant if you walk the shelves today or a store of today versus the store of yesteryear you find that the shelf is so much more vibrant The third which is amazing is the instructions Asian consumers read the back label Its amazingChristine Tan And western consumers dontMagesvaran Suranjan Well not as much Well I grew up in the East and in the West and I remember trusting the brand from the name from the advertising and picking it and trying it Here when you stand in front of the shelf and observe folks take the product and carefully read it for a couple of minutes and I think thats a very unique and endearing habit that is differentChristine Tan As part of the overall restructuring efforts your group CEO David Taylor has pledged to make another 10 billion in cost cuts by 2021 How does that affect you as you run AsiaPacific and IMEA What process do you have to go through to streamline the company further from hereMagesvaran Suranjan At the end of the day cost is an essential part of the business model And as we look at the different areas and you may have seen this in the public space of our media costs we are one of the highest spenders in media We have got costs on the product side and I would say these are the two biggest spend elements Christine And as we look at those areas there are still lots of room to grow especially with the evolution of technology We can get things done so much faster we can reach consumers so much more efficiently And in these areas I think we can achieve our share of the 10 billion and moreChristine Tan As part of the restructuring efforts are you under pressure to cut costs and to keep your headcount lowMagesvaran Suranjan The headcount is a function of growth So there is no specific headcount that I would necessarily focus on What we focus on is making sure we are winning were growing and as a result do we make the needed margins and the cost pools in the product side and in the marketing side which are our biggest spend areasChristine Tan Youre 49 years old born in Sri Lanka a trained public accountant MBA in marketing and finance spent the last 24 years working for PampG in the various product departments now incharge of Asia Pacific and IMEA How would you describe your leadership and your management styleMagesvaran Suranjan Goodness Its been an amazing journey  Sri Lanka to the US to China and now here in paradise No one has ever told me no They guided me and this has translated to into desired style of allowing people to go as far out to the frontiers as possible and if they fall catch them so they dont get hurt But let people go right to the edge and try stuff let them experiment let them innovate My mentors and my bosses taught me and gave me that confidence so every day I aspire to give the confidence to the people who work with meChristine Tan How do you go about inspiring your employees and nurturing talentMagesvaran Suranjan The thing that unites us all that our parents taught us is growth Every parent wants their kids to grow Every manager wants their employee to grow Inspiration is about keeping true to growth We all want to grow We want our families to grow We want to grow And as long as we keep that growth in front of each person every day then I believe that inspiration like it is for me will happen for all of usChristine Tan So how is decision making carried on within a company How much autonomy do you haveMagesvaran Suranjan I have full flexibility to run the region in the way that I and my leadership team sees best Of course we get clear guidance from my boss David Taylor and the global leadership team and we use it as guidance and its very helpful The beauty of PampG is that we are a large company and were able to get the perfect ecosystem of glocal global and local From a region standpoint across the 14 markets in APAC and the many more outside APAC that we serve what Id like to see is a more localized decision making Id like folks to try stuff and learn Learn about the consumer learn about the customer and learn about the shopper And we do that by tryingChristine Tan So a little bit of trial and errorMagesvaran Suranjan It has to be It wont be as random as that but it has to be one in which one has to feel that youve got enough rope to go to the edges and tryChristine Tan And finally whats kept you in PampG all these years What is it about the company thats kept you at PampG all these yearsMagesvaran Suranjan Folks have not told me what not to do and that has allowed me to grow every day It is so liberating to come to work to have these kinds of resources to work with this quality of people to work with people not just within PampG but all the other stakeholders we get to work with And this everyday growth has been something that you wake up every day and say Wow I cant wait to get to work todayENDSFor more informationClarence ChenCommunications Manager APAC CNBC InternationalD 65 6326 1123M 65 9852

11:59:00,Hackers working on behalf of Chinas Ministry of State Security breached the networks of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co and IBM then used the access to hack into their clients computers according to five sources familiar with the attacksThe attacks were part of a Chinese campaign known as Cloudhopper which the United States and Britain on Thursday said infected technology service providers in order to steal secrets from their clientsWhile cybersecurity firms and government agencies have issued multiple warnings about the Cloudhopper threat since 2017 they have not disclosed the identity of technology companies whose networks were compromisedInternational Business Machines Corp said it had no evidence that sensitive corporate data had been compromised Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE said it could not comment on the Cloudhopper campaignBusinesses and governments are increasingly looking to technology companies known as managed service providers MSPs to remotely manage their information technology operations including servers storage networking and helpdesk supportCloudhopper targeted MSPs to access client networks and steal corporate secrets from companies around the globe according to a US federal indictment of two Chinese nationals unsealed on Thursday Prosecutors did not identify any of the MSPs that were breachedBoth IBM and HPE declined to comment on the specific claims made by the sourcesIBM has been aware of the reported attacks and already has taken extensive countermeasures worldwide as part of our continuous efforts to protect the company and our clients against constantly evolving threats the company said in a statement We take responsible stewardship of client data very seriously and have no evidence that sensitive IBM or client data has been compromised by this threatHPE said in a statement that it had spun out a large managedservices business in a 2017 merger with Computer Sciences Corp that formed a new company DXC TechnologyThe security of HPE customer data is our top priority HPE said We are unable to comment on the specific details described in the indictment but HPEs managed services provider business moved

which has been targeting technology services providers for several years infiltrated the networks of HPE and IBM multiple times in breaches that lasted for weeks and months according to another of the sources with knowledge of the matterIBM investigated an attack as recently as this summer and HPE conducted a large breach investigation in early 2017 the source saidThe attackers were persistent making it difficult to ensure that networks were safe said another sourceIBM has dealt with some infections by installing new hard drives and fresh operating systems on infected computers said the person familiar with the effortCloudhopper attacks date back to at least 2014 according the indictmentThe indictment cited one case in which Cloudhopper compromised data of an MSP in New York state and clients in 12 countries including Brazil Germany India Japan the United Arab Emirates Britain and the United States They were from industries including finance electronics medical equipment biotechnology automotive mining and oil and gas explorationOne senior intelligence official who declined to name any victims who were breached said attacks on MSPs were a significant threat because they essentially turned technology companies into launchpads for hacks on clientsBy gaining access to an MSP you can in many cases gain access to any one of their customers said the official Call it

defines being online it includes anyone who has used the global network of networks within the past three months this will be an impressive landmark A decade ago the fraction of humanity with internet access hovered around 20 Closing the digital divide between the rich world and the poor would seem to be an unalloyed blessing for economic development in particular Studies suggest that a 10 increase in internet penetration is correlated with a 135 increase in GDP for developing countriesGet our daily newsletterUpgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editors PicksNaturally the ITU and other organisations have plenty of ideas about how to push penetration rates even higherespecially as the rise in internet access has slowed recently The un Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development in a report published in September 2018 lists half a dozen recommendations for governments including support for local digital businesses and reducing taxes on telecoms equipment The Alliance For Affordable Internet A4AI an advocacy group focuses on how the cost of access can be reduced for instance by fostering competition and clever allocation of wireless spectrum It thinks that governments should have the goal of bringing down costs to no more than 2 of average monthly income for one gigabyte of dataa target that is so far met by only 24 countries of the 61 covered in the groups Affordability Report from 2018Big tech firms too are making efforts to bring more people online Facebooks Free Basics programme for instance is now available in 65 countries It gives smartphone owners access to a limited selection of datalight websites and services including Facebook and WhatsApp the mobile messaging app it owns These are zero rated meaning they can be browsed for nothingYet the internet and the socialmedia platforms built on top of it do not just have the potential to boost growth and development They can also cause serious trouble This has been much talked about in rich countries in the wake of the online misinformation campaigns that were a factor in Americans electing Donald Trump as president and Britons voting for Brexit But the consequences in poor countries have been more worryingThe problems are the same as in the West plus more says Sandy Parakilas of the Centre for Humane Technology another advocacy group Users have often much less experience with other media so they tend to believe more readily what they come across online They have less choice because the internet giants are often even more dominant in poor countries than elsewhere Novice users of Facebooks Free Basics scheme may be unaware that they are seeing only a tiny handpicked selection of websites These countries also typically have weaker institutions that can be more easily undermined by misinformation And autocratic regimes are often the worst offenders in spreading fake newsIn Myanmar Facebook has been misused to deepen the hatred of the Rohingya minority In the Philippines it helped Rodrigo Duterte the populist president get elected and he now uses it to mount smear campaigns against opponents of his bloody war on drugs In India WhatsApp has had the most profound effect The app which boasts more than 200m users in the country has at times become a rumour mill In 2017 seven men in the eastern state of Jharkhand were murdered after rumours circulated on WhatsApp warning of kidnappers in the areaSo should efforts to get more people online be slowed down until they are better equipped to handle the technology That would be the wrong way to respond says Mr Parakilas As well as being paternalistic it is unlikely to work Even without policies to increase internet penetration more and more people will want to go online Keeping them from getting their hands on smartphones whose prices continue to drop for instance would cause a political backlash And blocking access to certain services is a temporary measure at best When Sri Lanka shut down a handful of socialmedia services in March 2018 in an attempt to quell ethnic strife many people turned to virtual private networks to bypass the blocksPolicies to deal with these problems are only just emerging says Dhanaraj Thakur of A4AI Some existing proposals such as improving media literacy creating safe spaces online or taxing socialmedia use as Uganda is trying to do do not sound convincing A more promising idea is to push online giants to change their ways It is also part of the Contract for the Web an initiative launched in November by Sir Tim BernersLee the inventor of the web which aims to keep it openOne possibility is to make sharing content on socialmedia platforms less easy for example to slow down the spread of information Facebook has changed WhatsApp to make it harder for users to forward messages to large groups Online firms also need to have more of a presence in the countries they serve so that they can work with the authorities to solve problems for too long Facebook had no employees in Myanmar Most importantly given that misinformation often attracts a lot of attention they need to rethink their business models which typically involve harvesting as much of users attention as possible in order to resell it to advertisersWhatever the policy mix the problems caused by more connectivity will not go away quickly This is going to get worse before it gets

chains,https://www.ft.com/content/2c90051e-03a5-11e9-9d01-cd4d49afbbe3,2018-12-21 22:00:26,On Britains busiest shopping street days before Christmas garish sale signs proclaiming discounts of up to 60 per cent have already been pasted over enticing festive displaysAfter weeks of tough trading it is a final throw of the dice for some retailers that are already licking their wounds and bracing themselves for a January reckoning when profits warnings even fullblown bankruptcies are increasingly anticipatedUK retail sales figures from the Office for National Statistics this week presented a surprisingly upbeat picture of trading in November with overall sales volumes increasing by 14 per cent month on month ahead of the average forecast of 03 per centBut across the industry fears are growing about what persistent price cutting is doing to profitability PreChristmas discounting is damaging for margins and I think we will see the effect of that in January says Richard Lim chief executive of consultancy Retail EconomicsThe dire picture is particularly bleak on the UK high street where companies such as Superdry and Bonmarche have cut profit expectations and Mike Ashley head of sportswear group Sports Direct warned retailers had been smashed to pieces in NovemberSome UK retailers are more optimistic that December might turn out better than the worst predictions with much riding on this weekend for bricksandmortar retailersBut Ian Geddes head of retail at Deloitte says Its hard to recall a Christmas environment that has been as competitive as the current marketThe Centre for Retail Research says 38 UK companies have failed this year affecting more than 43000 employees By the end of September there had been 28 profit warnings more than for the whole of 2017 and many share prices have fallen sharplyDebenhams regarded as one of the most challenged British operators hit an alltime low of 4p on Thursday The company worth more than 16bn when it refloated in 2006 is now capitalised at barely 50mYet evidence is also emerging of broader problems affecting retailers around the world and those that are mainly or wholly onlineA profit warning from Asos the UKlisted online fashion retailer on Monday flagged discounting pressure online and in markets worldwide and triggered share price falls across the sector HampM the Swedish fashion group was hit after it boosted sales only by cutting prices while shares in Inditex the worlds largest clothing retailer and owner of Zara have also tumbled this monthIn the US few retailing executives expect a disastrous festive season On the contrary strong economic data commerce department figures last week showed that core retail sales surged in November by the most in a year have prompted bullish predictions for the runup to ChristmasEven so bricks and mortar companies have announced the closure of more than 5400 stores this year according to Coresight Research compared with fewer than 3000 openingsIn spite of low unemployment and improving wages several US chains have collapsed this year including oncemighty department store chain Sears whose backers are trying to avert an outright liquidation in the bankruptcy courtsA recovery in US retail stocks has gone into reverse in recent weeks Victorias Secret owner L Brands is down 24 per cent in the past month luxury jewellers Tiffany 23 per cent and electronics chain Best Buy 18 per centHoliday sales seem pretty solid but there seem to be a lot of factors giving people reasons to be concerned says Jay Sole US retail analyst at UBSReluctance to spendThe consumer is definitely wary says one prominent UK retail executive Another adds that the drumbeat of negative stories about Brexit is starting to have an impact on shoppers in the UK People see the headlines about no deal and Bank of England governor Mark Carney talking about house prices falling 30 per cent and they start to think do I really want to be loading up my credit card right now he says The rate at which Britons are accumulating credit card debt has slowed since the summer according to Bank of England figuresDespite a pickup in wage growth disposable incomes remain under pressure especially among younger consumers The result is that customers increasingly expect to be offered discounts and will take their business elsewhere if they are not Asoss sales growth slowed in November because it declined to match rivals discounts It has budgeted for lower margins for the remainder of the year as it expects to have to cut prices As a result fullyear profits are expected to be half the previous forecastOn the other side of the Atlantic consumers wallets remain open benefiting internet retailers in particular US online sales surged 18 per cent between the start of November and December 19 according to data from MastercardThe picture is less rosy in stores however Footfall last week across the sector was 44 per cent lower than a year ago according to figures tracked by Cowen Retailers are also feeling the need to offer Americans special deals long after the Black Friday discounting weekend Average printed promotions tracked by consultants at Numerator showed discounts of 31 per cent on average last week with particularly generous offers on clothing jewellery and kitchenwareCosts are risingAccording to Retail Economics labour costs account for almost half of retailers total operating costs and in the UK they rose 45 per cent yearonyear in the third quarter Distribution costs were up 63 per cent and utilities prices were up almost 14 per centMeanwhile the British Retail Consortium estimates that the sector will pay an additional 2bn in business rates over the three years to April 2020 after a controversial 2017 revaluation exercise Business rates are a propertybased levy paid by UK businesses and split between central and local government and for many retailers they are a far more significant burden than corporation tax on profitsThe devaluation of the pound relative to the dollar since the UK voted to leave the EU has also increased the cost of goods such as electronics and clothing which tend to be imported from the Far EastIn the US higher tariffs on imports next year could force retailers to choose between risking volumes by pushing up prices or absorbing the additional costs Rising transport costs further threaten marginsOnline the industry is locked in a delivery deals war Target is offering customers twoday free shipping without any minimum purchases while Amazon has scrapped its 25 thresholdMaking online workThe squeeze on profits comes as retailers try to manage the huge structural shift to internet shopping according to the ONS figures online sales as a proportion of the total exceeded a fifth for the first time in November Pureplay online retailers such as Asos and Boohoo in the UK and Zalando in Germany promise investors rapid increases in sales and constant reinvestment of profit in more growth the model that has served Amazon so well But they do not have Amazons sales volumes or market dominance so their investors are not so relaxed about the prospect of 2 per cent marginsDespite lacking the overheads associated with physical outlets margins online are typically lower than those historically generated by stores Return rates are higher and the operations require hefty investments in logisticsFor established retailers this poses a conundrum If you do not sell to your customers online then somebody else will says one fashion retailer that does both Retailers have poured money into technology but in many cases the effect so far has been to dilute profitability rather than enhance itA succession of technical problems has meanwhile highlighted legacy operators digital inexperience In the busy Black Friday period internet shoppers complained of technical glitches at websites including J Crew Lululemon and LowesFailure to adaptOn top of the structural and cyclical challenges are the inevitable own goals and strategic errors Department stores for instance were slow to realise that categories such as fashion and beauty would be disrupted by the internet just as books and music were and continued to expand physical space even as sales moved onlineUK sale and leaseback deals that concluded in the 1990s and early noughties released lots of cash at the time but have left the likes of Debenhams and House of Fraser with long expensive and inflexible leasesIn the US the sectors failures to adapt to a rapidly changing environment are epitomised by Sears Heavily indebted and under the leadership of hedge fund manager Eddie Lampert the company struggled to find a strategy to compete effectively with ecommerce rivalsThen there is Black Friday a US tradition that spread to the UK and is now catching on in Europe and elsewhere Although the event is more carefully planned these days and some retailers have scaled back their promotional activity many executives worry that it is teaching consumers not to buy items that are not discountedThat effect will continue beyond December 25 Mr Geddes at Deloitte thinks poor preChristmas sales will increase the pressure on retailers to clear stock We are expecting average discounting of at least 52 per cent off from Boxing Day he says

leading a renewed drive for a common European Union army",https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-europe-ready-to-defend-itself-11546623417,2019-01-04 22:34:18,The new Republican administration in Washington issued a blunt warning Unless Europe quickly set up its own unified army the US would be compelled to undertake an agonizing reappraisal of its commitment to defend its European alliesThe year was 1953 and the main target of American ire was France whose delay in ratifying the European Defense Community treaty signed the previous year meant that preparations for a federal European army had to be paused But the pressure applied by the Eisenhower administration backfired spectacularly A joyous choir of French lawmakers broke into the Marseillaise when Frances parliament finally rejected the treaty in August 1954 The idea of a joint European defense policy was shelved for decadesToday the push for European autonomy in defenseand even for a common European Union armyis gathering momentum again in part because of doubts in many European capitals about President Donald Trumps willingness to defend the continent against a renewed threat from Russia Mr Trumps abrupt decision to withdraw US forces from Syria which prompted Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to resign has added new urgency to the driveThis time around the revival of European defense integration is championed by French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel while the American president keeps lobbing angry tweets at the very idea And inside Europe the skeptics today arent in Paris but in the former Soviet vassalstates in the east that despite all their misgivings still view the US as the only credible guarantor of their survival as independent nationsA historic swing in Europes public opinion particularly in Germanythe EUs most powerful state and one where transAtlantic cooperation was the bedrock of the political consensus since the end of World War IIhas fueled this changeMr Trump has described the EU as a foe and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as obsolete and he has publicly questioned why American soldiers should die for a NATO ally like Montenegro One recent opinion poll showed that Germans now rank Mr Trump as the greatest threat to their country In another 73 of Germans described their relationship with the US as bad and 72 wanted a foreign policy more independent from WashingtonsThe shift in public opinion is due to a mix of disappointment and fear said Volker Perthes director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs a think tank that advises the German government and parliament There is a fear that the US will be less interested in Europe and that the security commitments of the US will no longer be reliableIt was in this political environment that Ms Merkel told the European Parliament in a landmark speech in November The times when we could fully rely on others have endedIf we Europeans want to survive as a community we must make a greater effort to take our destiny into our own handsAchieving such strategic autonomy became the EUs official policy in 2016 Though calls by Mr Macron and Ms Merkel for a European army are largely rhetorical so far several concrete initiatives to achieve that goal have been launched since then Probably most significant is the 15 billion European Defense Fund which aims to spur Europes military industry and could limit the influence of American weapons manufacturers Another new initiative is the socalled Permanent Structured Cooperation system under which European armies seek to remove the barriers to joint action that stem from fielding so many differentand often incompatibletypes of weapons Addressing a frequently voiced demand of Mr Trump European governments have also raised their defense spending to get closer to the NATO target of 2 of each countrys GDP On the face of it there is no reason why an economic giant like the EU shouldnt be able to protect itself against Russia even without American help Setting aside Britain which seeks to continue to cooperate with the EU on security and defense even after leaving the bloc the remaining EUs population and defense budgets are roughly three times Russias size France the EUs military powerhouse spends almost as much as Russia on defense just by itself and operates an independent nuclear arsenal All those sums of course are dwarfed by the US whose military budget is nearly double the defense spending of the EU minus the departing UK and Russia combinedEurope is addicted to the American security umbrella said Bruno Tertrais deputy director of the Foundation for Strategic Research a think tank that advises the French government But if the US werent there Europe would have found a way to defend itselfYet there is a Catch22 that makes these aspirations risky Building up European defenses after seven decades of American protection would take time Meanwhile every move that Europe attempts in this direction spurs an American backlash further undermining NATOs cohesionand its deterrent capacity against a rapidly militarizing Russia We have to hedge But it is a very tricky situation When does the hedge become a wedge said Franois Heisbourg a veteran French expert who advised Mr Macrons presidential campaign on security and defense  Trump doesnt believe in alliances and doesnt understand what an alliance is Franois Heisbourg adviser to Emmanuel Macrons presidential campaignTrump doesnt believe in alliances and doesnt understand what an alliance is he added So if we discover that Plan Awhat has happened over the last 70 yearsis no longer on offer we would have been remiss if we had not worked on Plan B But of course we do not want to precipitate the end of Plan A by getting Plan B wrong This is the challenge for every country that is allied with the USIt is a particularly urgent challenge for NATO countries in Eastern and Central Europe Officials there fret about loose talk of a European army and dislike the very concept of EU strategic autonomy fearing that it may needlessly alienate the US After all if you border on Russia what you want is more Americans in your neighborhood now not a pretext for costconscious Washington to pull the plug Autonomy means autonomy from someoneits better to use another term such as a European push forward or European structural strengthening said Lithuanias defense minister Raimundas KaroblisPoland another neighbor of Russia has even offered to pay more than 2 billion to set up a permanent US base on its soil proposing to call it Fort Trump in a notsosubtle appeal to the presidents vanity Washington is still evaluating the proposal while German officials are lobbying against it fearing that it would further antagonize RussiaWe believe that the United States is indispensable in European security said Bartosz Cichocki Polands deputy foreign minister for security affairs He held up the November 2018 incident in the Black Sea where Russia attacked and seized three Ukrainian navy ships as a sobering example of just how hollow the EUs role in defending the regions security remains Where was Europe Nowhere Those who advocate a European army European selfsufficiency had a great opportunity to take the lead to show us the way of how to deescalate and how to stop Russia he scoffedSuch divisions within Europe on security matters make it a much weaker adversary for Russia which has spent the past decade upgrading its military and is now fielding an entire new tank army on the EUs eastern flank The EU is likely dealing with a lasting change in the global security architecture  In defense and defense industry it is not Europe it is 28 European states said Christian Mlling deputy director of Germanys DGAP research institute who cowrote a recent report outlining the shortfalls in the EUs military muscle If you take trade we are acting as one with a central and single policy which makes us the biggest trading bloc in the world But in defense we are not able to act as a huge forceThough Mr Trumps repeated verbal attacks on European allies generated the current sense of crisis Europes security predicament is compounded by an isolationist streak that runs through Americas political landscape In fact European officials say that the EU is likely dealing not with a temporary hurdle but with a lasting change in the global security architecture as the relative size of Americas economic and military might declines with the rise of rival powers most notably China President Barack Obama wasnt as abrasive as Mr Trump in his dealings with European allies but it was his administration that withdrew two of the four US Army brigades deployed on the continent including all American main battle tanks We see Trump as the symptom of the problem not as the problem a senior French official saidParadoxically Mr Trumps combative rhetoric has been accompanied so far by decisions that have actually strengthened US commitments to European security The Pentagon under Mr Mattis deployed 700 Marines to Norway adding to the rotating armored brigadesize American presence deployed in Poland and Romania in early 2017 Economic sanctions against Russia have been tightened too in part due to congressional actionEuropes Defense ChallengesWith Trumps presidency more US soldiers are on European soil than before under Obama The US president is fulfilling the commitments of the US one by one This is appreciated and we also have to do our part said senior German lawmaker Jrgen Hardt the foreignpolicy spokesman for Ms Merkels faction What we are talking about is making the European pillar of NATO more effective which also means burdensharing and this might take responsibility away from US soldiers We do not talk about separation in the field of territorial defense of Europe It is not helpful if some people interpret it that wayThe current debate over Europes strategic autonomy often clouded by misunderstandings within Europe and between European governments and the US goes to the very foundations of the European projectan idea nurtured by Washington after the devastation visited on the continent by World War IIThe seed from which todays European Union sprang up was the European Coal and Steel Community established in 1951 By pooling these industries indispensable for modern warfare into a single market under a supranational authority the founding fathers of European integration sought to make another war among Germany France and Italy impossibleFrench Prime Minister Ren Pleven came up with the plan for a unified European army under a common European defense minister in a speech in 1950 and Gen Dwight EisenhowerNATOs first supreme allied commanderquickly became one of the ideas most enthusiastic supporters The 1952 treaty establishing the European Defense Community with a headquarters in Paris also provided for a joint European parliament laying the foundations of a federal European stateWhile most other memberstates ratified the treaty France embroiled in a bloody colonial war in Vietnam kept holding out Once Mr Eisenhower became president in 1953 his secretary of state John Foster Dulles repeatedly pushed Paris to act Washington even threatened to cut off military aid to European countries that remained outside the EDCBut by then the alliance between French parties beholden to Moscow and nationalists skeptical of the European project and of ties with America was simply too stronga precursor of sorts to political dynamics in Europe today The EDC treaty was killed without debate by Frances parliament in August 1954 It is a tragedy that in one country nationalism abetted by communism has asserted itself so as to endanger the whole of Europe Mr Dulles said the following dayIt took more than four decades until the late 1990s for the idea of a common European defense policy to rise again this time with the participation of Britain By then the US having won the Cold War viewed any such European aspirations to strategic autonomy with suspicion In 1998 then Secretary of State Madeleine Albright issued her famous three Ds warning that any European security initiative should avoid delinking Europe from NATO duplicating existing efforts and discriminating against nonEU statesToday US hostility to European selfreliance in defense is rooted in similar concerns and is shared well beyond Mr Trumps circle Mr Mattis for one denounced the idea in a sharply worded confidential letter to Frances government in 2018The recent initiative to create a European army or European combined armed forces is not a good idea It will undermine NATO over time and will further the division between the US and our European allies and partners said retired US Navy Adm James Stavridis who served in 200913 as one of Eisenhowers successors at the helm of NATOs supreme allied commandIn a rapidly changing world however those concerns are misplaced argued Ivo Daalder the president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs who served in 200913 as US ambassador to NATO After 70 years there is a legitimate question raised both in the United States and in Europe When is Europe going to be able to take care of itself How much more money do they need to make to finally deal with the security challenge that economically they should be able to deal with Mr Daalder wondered I dont think we should discourage Europe Anything that strengthens Europes capacity to defend itself enhances the transAtlantic alliance rather than undermining itWrite to

Here's what other presidents said.",http://fortune.com/2018/12/26/stock-market-trump-compare-presidents/,2018-12-26 22:19:53,Its rare the executive branch weighs in on equity valuations But sometimes a president just cant resistTake Tuesday when Donald Trump said American shares are giving investors a tremendous opportunity to buy Reasonable people can differ on whether it mattered its hardly the first time hes mentioned stocks and Trump gets a fair amount of blame lobbed at him for the selloff as well Whatever the case he said it and the SampP 500 shot up as much as 27 after four straight days of losses and the worst Christmas Eve trading session everPerhaps the most famous instance of presidential stock prognostication was in March 2009 six days before the financial crisis bottom when Barack Obama told reporters that profitandearnings ratios are starting to get to the point where buying stocks is a potentially good deal His comments came a day after the Dow dropped below 7000 for the first time since 1997 and the SampP 500 hit its lowest level since October 1996 Even with the recent rout the SampP 500 is up more than 250 since March 2009It is not unheard of to have presidents comment on the stock market even though its not considered to be a good idea It can actually spook investors said Steffen Schmidt professor of political science at Iowa State University For his part Schmidt took Obamas advice and bought stocks in 2009 I had my 401k manager buy some best picks They proved to be a great value he said adding that he bought shares of energy stocks following Trumps comments as wellTrump often talks about the market and uses it as a barometer of his success Since his election hes tweeted about stocks more than 35 timesPresident Trump unlike previous presidents has staked much of his economic success on the stock market Its not crazy in that sense to encourage people to buy stocks said David Primo associate professor of political science and business administration at the University of Rochester Its atypical for presidents generally but given the way the president has developed his economic platform its not that unusualHerein with the help of historians university professors and Cumberland Advisors a sampling of market sentiment from presidents pastJimmy CarterPresident Carter who was in office from 1977 to 1981 spread gloom and doom about the energy crisis that engulfed the nation at the time said Schmidt The crisis saw oil prices jump roughly 350 thanks in part to an OPEC oil embargoI think that until the question of energy is resolved the uncertainty about this subject and the realization that our excessive imports of oil or adverse balance of trade is going to be permanent those two things are going to contribute to the deleterious effects of increasing interest rates and also uncertainty in the stock market Carter said in 1978Ronald ReaganIn October 1987 President Reagan said soaring federal deficits helped trigger one of the largest oneday drops in Dow Jones history when the index fell nearly 23 Traders dubbed the day Black MondayI couldnt understand at the beginning that creating 14 million new jobs eliminating inflationor virtually eliminating it bringing it downlowering interest rates increasing the prosperity of the peopleI just wouldnt understand that that could hurt the stock market he said I think everyone has been caught by surprise in this And it is true that at this point of the day the market is in a far better situation than it was yesterday at this time with about the same number of sales of stocktrading of stock But Im very pleased and gratified with the action that has been taken so far by the Federal Reserve Board and the fact that two of the major banks have lowered their interest ratesBill ClintonPresident Clinton in an October 1997 speech focused on the strength of the US economy and avoided talking about the stock market during the Asian currency crisis His comments came one day after the Dow Jones lost 554 pointsthe biggest ever point loss at the timethat temporarily suspended trading on US stock marketsIt may be disappointing but I think it is neither prudent nor appropriate for any president to comment on the hourbyhour or the daybyday movements of the market the president saidGeorge W BushPresident George W Bush spoke to the nation in September 2008 as the financial crisis intensified saying that his administration was working on addressing the root causes behind market instabilityIm a strong believer in free enterprise so my natural instinct is to oppose government intervention I believe companies that make bad decisions should be allowed to go out of business Under normal circumstances I would have followed this course But these are not normal circumstances The market is not functioning properly There has been a widespread loss of confidence and major sectors of Americas financial system are at risk of shutting down The governments top economic experts warn that without immediate action by Congress America could slip into a financial panic and a distressing scenario would unfold More banks could fail including some in your community The stock market would drop even more which would reduce the value of your retirement account The value of your home could plummet Foreclosures would rise dramatically

included some restitution for residents who would be evictedI didnt want the money says Don Roberto Munoz one of Martinezs neighbors I wanted my daughters to stay in the schools hereMartinez and

learned how to weld with hopes to fund his true love a dogtraining businessFor most of my life I was struggling I never felt financially secure For the last 15 years I have owned and operated a dog training company called Top Dog K9 I train police dogs personal protection dogs security dogs et cetera Some years I would make around 10000 a year Other years Id make 50000 My goal is to buy a facility so I can have a dog daycare kennel on top of the dog training I currently do But to do that I need save up money and build up my credit so I can qualifyMore than a year ago my cousin told me about a welding helper job in Maryland I packed up and the next day I drove to Maryland moved in with him and joined him on the job I noticed how much the welders were making As that project was coming to an end they started laying off workerswhich isnt odd most would move on to the next job But I was laid off for six months after that During that time I continued operating my dog training company The pay is inconsistent and not having a facility limits how many clients I can have at a time which limits how much I makeIn September I completed a free welding course from Goodwill called Flip the Script I trained at their Green Works facility in Detroit Now Im consistently making 2000 to 4000 a week between two of my separate welding jobs I have five kids aged 30 22 20 18 and 13 Im a father like every other father trying to make a better future for my family I also own my own house in Detroit But I hope to get into a training program for pipe welding where I could make around 5000 per week That way I can save up and be able to buy the dog daycare kennel and make dog training my only profession I feel like Ive entered into a new era in my life As told to Nick HagenWho Says Artists Must Be StarvingNew York City actor Nick Westrate 35 discovers fame without fortuneI had a good year I have been in four playsgood big playsconsistently for 52 weeks They gave me a special Drama Desk Award for the achievement This is what success was supposed to look like right It was only going well in that I was working in New York I didnt realize that working could be such a problemOff Broadway doesnt pay Maybe like 500 a week or at best 750 Thats before taxes And before that 10 goes to your manager and another 10 to your agent I was temping 9 to 5 doing administrative work at a hedge fund Id do that a full workday then go to the theater and nap on the Equity cot then perform I wondered what people who didnt need to temp did with their days They relaxed They enjoyed the city They lived I was working but I wasnt living And during rehearsals I couldnt temp so I lived off credit cards I had four cards and tens of thousands of dollars of debt And people were calling me successful I was getting an award for how hard I was working And at the same time I was declaring personal bankruptcyEvery time you do an OffBroadway play you meet all the top peoplethe board members and donors and all of thatand theyre all thanking you Thank you Oh my God thank you so much Thank you for doing this And I realized that they were thanking me because they knew they were fucking me over They knew they could pay us more but had decided not to They knew they were getting away with it Its the other acting in theater We were all pretending it was fine that we were fine treating people like that was fine I reached a point where I stopped pretending I was fine A playwright told me once that America will always hate artists because we get to do what we love I didnt want to believe that but its true It turns out you cant take awards to the ATM or to your landlord AndI have to say thisIm a white male and having these fights I cant imagine how hard it is to be a black actor an immigrant actor a trans actor The disrespect is shockingWe work A labor of love is still labor Its physically exhausting Its emotionally draining Its not a coal mine but these days not a lot of work is happening in mines There will always be new art more art The problem instead is that we dont value it not even within the industry The Public Theater is a nonprofitbut one with a 44 million budget that pays 1 a year in rent Shakespeare in the Park is free because its underwritten by 43 million from Delta The money is there They can afford not to screw actors over Were more than the labor Were the product tooWe fought and in 2016 won huge wage increases as high as 83 at some theaters But its not enough We need a focused fundlike were seeing in Boston in San Francisco in DCthat goes straight to fair wages on stage Broadway makes so so much that we could raise ticket prices there by 50 and it brings OffBroadway six or seven million dollars closer to fairness How the hell are you going to enjoy an actors work the culture that work adds to the city and say its not worth 50 This is necessary Because otherwise we end up with the British problem that only the privileged can make art No Im not willing to let the privileged be the only storytellers I care too much about art to let that happen As told to Richard MorganNicole AdkinsExecutive Director amp Founder Gods Grace Mobile Food Pantry in Dayton OhioIn our area a lot of the jobs that were coming in are going out The pay rate is not as high as it used to be Many of our factories have been outsourced to other locations Businesses that closed have left families searching for jobs The jobs they do find are giving lower amounts than before People have to figure out if they are going to pay their monthly bills or buy food for their familiesA lot of people dont realize that many of the homeless have jobs The more you work the more you get punished for trying to better yourself We see families that were getting food stamps suddenly get a raise that puts them over that margin They now have no choice but to come to a pantry to get food for their families As told to Carson KesslerCaught in the American TrapPreston Montague 40 earned a degree and developed a career But hes still searching for his safety netMy childhood felt like everything was intact Even the 90s and college What followed was called a recession or income inequality or economic anxiety but really it was an unraveling I feel like a domesticated animal left alone in the woods thrown outside but still able to see the light of living room windows I dont have a buffer I float on luck Theres an existential threat my parents didnt faceMy dad worked for the government and has a pension I meanwhile am a gay man with a queer job I always have to select other on bank or government forms and handwrite landscape architecture My entire existence personal and professional is a fight to be seen and understood I am always explaining myself as if I shouldnt exist I met someone and told them what I do and their response was That doesnt sound like a lot of money It takes a tollthings like irritable bowel syndrome caused by chronic stress the inflammation of loneliness the inflammation of fear Theres no respite Theres no flow I create all my flow Thats my real fulltime job Everything is a damn fightThe residential work I do is largely for two demographics those who work in finance and those who work in medicine My work is seen as a luxury good which is a way to say Im special when what theyre really saying is that Im frivolous I suppose Im middle class but what does that even mean Its all notquitepoor and humbly rich I dont see much of a middlemiddle class anymoreMy work improves the health of the human species and the planet but people think Im a glorified florist an exterior decorator They ask which flowers are cutest for the base of their mailbox They expect me to have been trained with an answer and to offer my expertise at no chargeIts deflating to realize the amount of money I make in a year hasnt changed in a decade despite getting a graduate school degreeMy budget is tight Lower rent exists but its a choice between mold or mayhem I have about 200 in savings per month but only if I pay near the minimal amount of school loans back to not accrue interest Im not really able to pay the loans off Its 100000 I just keep them from increasing I plan to do this until I reach the 25year forgiveness limit when my remaining school debt disappears Its sad Its shameful Education here doesnt guarantee anything other than debt Its a trap the American TrapPeople who arent doctors and lawyers and bankers deserve the freedoms of dignity and comfort Yes my hands are dirty some nights but not from work I choose to grow my own food Lettuce kale and collards in the summer and tomatoes melon and peppers in the summer Some weeks I live off those vegetables I make an

gateway allowing crossplatform transactions At the heart of this system are QR codes the lowcost lowtech phonescannable bar codes which are powering commerce across AsiaQR codes are driving the adoption of mobile payments systems throughout Asia  BloombergThis may prove crucial for a central bank aiming to achieve 75 per cent financial inclusion by 2019 a target that is unlikely to be met by relying solely on traditional banks In 2017 the World Bank estimated only 49 per cent of Indonesians aged 15 and over had bank accountsGoPay leads but competition is growingOur latest survey found that GoPay the payment arm of Indonesian tech startup GoJek remained the countrys most popular mobile payments platform but it faces growing competition from OVO Cash part of the Lippo Group conglomerate However the two companies are likely to face stiffer competition next year as traditional banks take a greater share of the marketOur survey found that GoPay was used by almost threequarters of mobile payments users in the three months to the end of September up slightly from the same period last year followed by OVO which was used by around 42 per cent some people used bothOVO is a relative newcomer this was the first time we included it in our annual survey It only recently expanded from a service that was used mostly at retail checkouts to become the preferred payment partner of ridehailing app Grab and Tokopedia Indonesias largest online marketplaceLike most payment brands in Indonesia OVOs rise largely resulted from aggressive promotions It currently offers up to 60 per cent cashback in the form of points that can only be spent at OVOs merchant partners and service providers After tying up with Grab and Tokopedia OVO claims it has become the number one platform in Indonesia by payments volumeStill in infancyMobile payments have soared in the past year on the back of these costly promotional activities Indonesian mobile payments accounts held Rp11tn 75m in October more than triple the amount the year before However this only represents around half of the value of funds stored in the prepaid cash cards issued by banksPrepaid cash cards are widely used in Indonesia especially for paying road tolls and making purchases at ubiquitous convenience stores such as Indomaret and Alfamart Although the total value of transactions using mobile payment systems and prepaid cash cards hit Rp36tn in the first 10 months of this year this is equivalent to just 15 per cent of the shopping transactions made using debit cards and only 3 per cent of overall wholesale and retail salesA game changerBank Indonesia is pushing competing mobile payments platforms to use its centralised payments gateway rather than their own internal payments networks Doing so will allow a merchant using a GoPay account for example to receive funds from a buyer on the OVO platformBanks that have adopted QR codes including major domestic ones such as Bank Mandiri and Bank Rakyat Indonesia BRI will also be able to handle transactions on this open system The system should be fully deployed in the second half of 2019 and is expected to dramatically increase the volume of transactionsThis will contribute to the gradual obsolescence of prepaid cash cards which are impractical compared with payments systems running on QR codes and require relatively expensive infrastructure particularly in remote regions Our survey showed that cash cards are already less popular than mobile payments especially outside JavaAmong the banks we see Bank Central Asia Indonesias largest bank by assets as having the best chance for early success in QR code adoption The banks mobile payment system BCA Klikpay already ranks fourth in our surveyMutual growthThe expansion of mobile payments will also benefit banks in generating more offline transactions Their extensive digital payments infrastructures can be quickly converted to accept QR codes For example Bank Mandiri Indonesias secondlargest bank by assets has credit and debit card readers installed in 240000 merchants compared to the 27000 merchants that accept OVO point payments as of AugustGiven this untapped growth potential banks expected inroads into the mobile payments sector is unlikely to come at the expense of the likes of GoPay and OVO Fintech companies will continue to dominate on their own turf such as in ridesharing delivery services and ecommerce ecosystems but they cannot afford to maintain their promotional activities Industry players told FT Confidential Research that during the initial stages of brand promotion a fintech company can spend up to Rp500bn a month subsidising customersThose companies that can monetise their services will have a better chance at reducing their dependence on subsidies In this regard GoPays parent GoJek is currently leading mainly due to a food delivery service which boasts 250000 merchants across 50 cities making it the largest in Asia outside China

secretive USbacked initiative to forge closer ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel faces setbacks after the crown prince who spearheaded the effort was implicated in a journalists killing along with two of his aides The two close advisers to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman who played key roles in the behindthescenes contacts between the two countries lost their jobs over suspected involvement in the operation that led to journalist Jamal Khashoggis death inside the kingdoms Istanbul consulate in October The international uproar that followed the murder and the fallout within the royal court also curbed the princes room to maneuver among prospective rivals and dampened appetite for risky foreign policy endeavors such as the outreach to Israel a longtime foe say people familiar with the situation Things have definitely cooled off right after Khashoggis murder said a senior Saudi government official The last thing the kingdom wants is for this to come out now and cause another backlash The two aides former royal court adviser Saud alQahtani and former deputy intelligence chief Ahmed alAssiri played important roles in the clandestine outreach to Israel according to people familiar with their work Saudi Arabia doesnt officially recognize Israel Mr Qahtani as media adviser issued directives to the Saudi press to help soften Israels image in the kingdom where the country has long been portrayed as the Zionist enemy He was also involved in the kingdoms purchase of advanced surveillance technology from Israeli firms say Saudi officials That brief dovetailed with his role monitoring critics and stifling dissent in Saudi Arabia which included the hacking of electronic communications Maj Gen Assiri a subordinate of Mr Qahtani secretly traveled to Israel on several occasions making him the most senior Saudi official known to have set foot in the country according to several people familiar with the matter His trips focused on how the kingdom could benefit from Israels stateoftheart surveillance technology some of the people said Mr Qahtani and Maj Gen Assiri didnt respond to text messages seeking comment Spokespeople for the Saudi government didnt respond to requests for comment Spokespeople for Israels government declined to comment Their dismissal highlights a bigger problem for the diplomatic initiative the crown princes diminished role in the wake of the Khashoggi murder King Salman who has taken a more active role in government in the aftermath of the Khashoggi crisis has been more adverse to warmer ties with Israel than his 33yearold son recently describing resolving the Palestinians plight with Israel as the kingdoms foremost priority in the region The setback to burgeoning links between the Saudi kingdom and Israel also throws into doubt the broader realignment in the region that the Trump administration sees as crucial to its Middle East strategy including containing Iran and resolving the decadeslong conflict between the Palestinians and Israelis Still SaudiIsraeli ties will likely endure despite the setbacks due to shared business and security interests Israeli companies consider Saudi Arabia a lucrative market for their cybersecurity products and have weighed investing in and supplying technology to the crown princes prize project Neom a futuristic technologydriven city still in the early construction stages The Saudi government meanwhile has been weighing an investment of at least 100 million in various Israeli technology companies according to people familiar with the deal Since the Khashoggi killing negotiations on that deal have cooled but contacts continue some of these people said Saudi Arabia and Israel have edged closer despite the sizable political risks in the kingdom to be seen cozying up to a country widely reviled in the Arab world for occupying Palestinian territory and depriving the Palestinians a state of their own Saudi leaders have kept their links to Israel secret worried about the political costs of a more open relationship with Israel On Israels side Mossad Director Yossi Cohen met Saudi officials several times over the past year say the people familiar with the matter including a June meeting with senior Saudi officials at a USbrokered rendezvous that also included Egyptian Jordanian and Palestinian intelligence officers Israel Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates now regularly share intelligence on shared threats mostly on transit through the Red Sea but also on other matters related to Iran according to people familiar with the matter Israel and Saudi Arabia began to draw closer in the twilight of the Obama administration their approach smoothed by a shared antipathy toward an Iran nuclear deal that both governments believed would empower their rival When Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016 Israel and Saudi Arabia seized on a friendlier White House to advance shared regional goals above all curbing the influence of Iran and of its proxies The next year after Prince Mohammed became heir apparent to the Saudi throne the outreach to Israel intensified The closer relationship has benefited both sides Following the global backlash to Mr Khashoggis killing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was one of few world leaders who came out in Prince Mohammeds support despite the CIAs conclusion that he had likely ordered the killing Several senators who received a CIA briefing said they believe he ordered the murder The Israeli leader warned that a destabilized Saudi Arabia would imperil the region and the world The Saudi government denies that Prince Mohammed had any role in the crime Saudi Arabia has quietly began issuing a special waiver to Israeli businessmen that allows them to travel to the kingdom on special documents people familiar with the process said The documents provided by the government of Saudi Arabia and aimed at facilitating business between the two countries allow Israelis to enter the kingdom without showing Israeli passports Among that business is technology that Saudis use to monitor its critics Mr Qahtani the media adviser sought out software made by Israeli spyware maker NSO Group and its affiliate Q Cyber Technology which began providing the kingdom cyber surveillance tools last year in a 55 million deal said Saudi officials Qahtani was the key player in all of this said one Saudi official He wanted the best and he knew that Israeli firms offered the best NSO said it licenses its technology to government intelligence and lawenforcement agencies to help them fight terrorism and crime It said Mr Qahtani didnt buy any software The business contacts werent merely transactional They sent a broader message to the region that Saudi Arabia was open to elevating the bilateral relationship with Israel however cautiously Since introducing the Arab Peace initiative in 2002 Saudi Arabias official position has been not to normalize ties with Israel unless there is a Palestinian state based on 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital The plight of the Palestinians remains a key impediment to progress especially publicly The level of direct security military and intelligence cooperation between Israel and the Gulf states with America as a partner is lightyears ahead of what it was a few years ago said Robert Wexler a former Democratic congressman and president of the S Daniel Abraham center for Middle East Peace But without a resolution on the PalestinianIsraeli issue there is a glass ceiling Write to Felicia Schwartz at FeliciaSchwartzwsjcom

set hard targets for cutting carbon emissions just 6 per cent of those eligible to vote backed the plan Yet within months Shell had announced an ambition to halve its carbon footprint by 2050 with the goal including a reduction in pollution from cars that burn the companys petrol and diesel Then in December it pledged to set firm shortterm emissions targets from 2020 that will be tied to executive pay If we dont meet them there will be consequences to my salary and others says Ben van Beurden Shells chief executive I hope you are in no doubtwe are absolutely serious about thisThe turnround is stunning in an industry that for years was reluctant to take responsibility for its broad contribution to global warming while spending millions of dollars on lobbying to counter efforts to cut emissionsMark van Baal founder of Follow This the activist group behind the Shell campaign is in no doubt who is responsible for the shift big investors including the Church of England Pensions Board which oversees the retirement pot for Anglican clergy which formed part of the 6 per cent in favour of the activist groups proposalThe real heroes of this story are the institutional investors he says Mr van Beurden echoes that saying it was dialogue with investors that led to the evolution in Shells position Following decades of campaigning by environmentalists and nongovernment organisations it is now spreadsheetanalysing money managers responsible for the nest eggs of millions of people who are forming a new generation of climate activists And these activists are backed by trillions of

sovereign wealth funds are using their power to push the biggest corporate polluters to tackle climate change spearheading campaigns to cut carbon emissions boost disclosure on climate risk and hold managers accountable Big oil companies are more powerful than most governments says Mr van Baal who is pushing companies including Shell BP ExxonMobil Chevron and Equinor to set hard longterm targets Only the investors can make them changeFor years the 85tn asset management industry largely shrugged off global warming ignoring environmental campaigners in favour of dividends But after the financial crisis the pressure from clients policymakers and the public to hold companies to account intensified The 2015 Paris accord  when 200 countries agreed to limit the rise in average global temperatures to well below 2C compared to preindustrial levels galvanised campaigners But the primary motivating factor for bigname investors from BlackRock to Calpers the California state employees pension fund to act is a realisation of the financial risk involved in these investmentsA global temperature rise above 15C would be catastrophic and the world has already warmed by about 1C since the start of the industrial age largely due to greenhouse gases released from the burning of fossil fuels Now oil and gas companies are under scrutiny like never beforeUnrestrained their activities which investors say are predicated on a future rise in global temperature of 3C could accelerate global warming There is also the concern that a continued push by governments to cut emissions to meet their Paris targets will trigger a transformation of the energy industry that would make a huge number of oil and gas projects uneconomic diminishing the value of these assets and investors shareholdingsFor larger investors there is also the fear of potential collateral damage the behaviour of the oil and gas groups they invest in could hit other parts of their portfolio from agrifood stocks suffering if crops fail to the falling share prices of companies which operate coastal infrastructureRightthinking people who understand the climate science here and are in positions of power and influence are now beginning to think how does the financial ecosystem benefit or not from climate risk says Steve Waygood the chief responsible investment officer at Aviva Investors the 350bn asset management arm of the British insurer While there are shortterm gains to be made the longerterm environmental disaster spells an economic disasterA 2015 study that has subsequently been used by investors to assess the value of the global total stock of manageable assets at risk due to climate change estimated losses could range from 42tn to in a worstcase scenario 43tn between now and the end of the century Pension funds that need to provide retirement incomes for decades to come are on high alert As are insurers which are facing a potential increase in payouts as rising emissions trap heat and trigger floods droughts forest fires and heatwaves as well as hits to their investment portfolios This anxiety has sparked a wave of climate activism at the highest levels of the financial world over the risks associated with holdings in listed fossil fuel producers such as Shell ExxonMobil and Chevron even as these companies benefit from feeding rising energy demand as the world economy grows and populations swellEnergy majors have been called on to cut emissions from fossil fuel extraction and processing switch to producing lowcarbon fuels such as gas over coal or dirtier types of oil improve efficiency in transmission and distribution and boost their presence in renewables They are also being urged to invest in technologies such as carbon capture and storageEthical funds the managers

investors the first step is to assess the scale of the problem and Mark Carney the governor of the Bank of England has led an initiative to push energy companies and others to disclose climate risks Adam Matthews director of ethics and engagement for the Church of England Pensions Board says big investors have a fiduciary duty to investigate how many assets would lose value We are all under an obligation to provide a return but equally weve got to do it in a way thats sustainable says Mr Matthews who led the talks with Shell alongside international asset manager Robeco about setting hard targets for carbon emissions cuts on behalf of a group of investors called Climate Action 100 that has a combined 32tn under managementHe says energy companies need to show they are capable of thriving in a lowcarbon world by shifting investments such as from oil sands to cleaner energies They could also curtail spending in legacy projects manage their decline and prioritise shareholder returns You are seeing the mobilisation of pension funds which I must admit I never necessarily expected says Mr Matthews Pension funds are on the front lines of whether the world transitions to a lower carbon economy and could be a phenomenal lever of change he saysThe debate is still largely focused on making pledges rather than forcing action But the matter has become more urgent and investors are increasingly filing and backing shareholder campaigns such as the one led by Follow This The number of investor resolutions focused on climate change across all sectors doubled to 42 between the 20132014 and 20162017 voting seasons according to data provider Proxy InsightMost notable was Exxons 2017 annual meeting when more than 60 per cent of shareholders including BlackRock revolted and voted against the board Exxon has subsequently improved its disclosure of information around climate changeThat vote put energy companies on notice says Anne Simpson director of global

climaterelated financial disclosuresMany pension funds are now pushing asset managers to prioritise climate change in discussions with companies a survey by UK asset manager Schroders found At the same time some investors such as LGIM are not only pushing energy companies directly but applying pressure on the banks that extend financing to themEnvironmental campaigners however say that engagement alone is not enough and have called for divestment a strategy where climateconscious investors pull their money out of environmentally subpar companies But stellar dividends mean they have a delicate balancing actThe most effective thing that you can do is to voice concern of the companies that you own before you walk for the exit says Avivas Mr Waygood But even he acknowledges there were companies that the market would inevitably find unviable and where divestment was the only option He identifies Coal India China Resources Power China Coal Energy and Alliances Resources Power as among those that cant transition or at least wontAccording to lobby group Go Fossil Fuel about 1000 investors with 718tn in assets have committed to divest from at least some type of fossil fuels This includes PKA the Danish pension fund which has pulled its investments in several oil producers as well as coal companies The Church of England dumped coal and tar sands in 2015 and in a hugely symbolic move in July it voted to sell holdings in fossil fuel companies slow to tackle global warming from 2023Nick Mabey chief executive of E3G a nonprofit group dedicated to accelerating the energy transition says investors are the new act in town and have huge influence but he adds they lack clarity on what constitutes successWhether these oil and gas companies go under or hang on is of no interest to the planet The only people that care are the investors he says Adding that they also have little impact on stateowned energy players that produce most of the worlds oil and gas Investors would do more good he believes if they pushed governments into creating policy that would bring certainty about how energy companies should operate32tnIn assets under management held by investors in

201617 voting season Energy companies are slowly realising the importance of dialogue with investors and religious groups Darren Woods the chief executive of Exxon was among industry figures who attended an audience with Pope Francis this year on climate changeSome figures are already trying to show they are tackling climate change as an industry committing to reduce methane emissions through the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative Its members include large European and US groups as well as stateowned Saudi Aramco the worlds biggest oil producing companyBut some in the industry including Bob Dudley the BP chief executive have been outspoken about the risks associated with meeting investor demands for change saying that forcing companies to predict an uncertain future using simple assumptions would almost certainly be wrong and possibly leave them open to legal action He also warned that insufficient spending into new oil and gas production could have farreaching consequences for energy security across the world Many investors still need to be persuaded of their power to dictate change But a growing number believe it is important to convince energy companies particularly those that are stateowned to set meaningful climaterelated goalsThere is no question that investors are helping to move companies says Mindy Lubber chief executive of investor group Ceres Yet Ms Lubber admits the strongest resistance is coming from the sector facing the steepest challenge As investors in energy companies you are largely saying to them what you are making is no longer a

leaving EU,https://www.ft.com/content/1598ddc8-01dd-11e9-99df-6183d3002ee1,2018-12-23 05:00:44,The grand salons of Lancaster House in Londons Whitehall played host to the great and the good of Britains space industry this month But a star guest was missing from the Christmas reception the minister with responsibility for space technologySam Gyimah had resigned from his post as universities and science minister a few days before in protest at the governments Brexit policy The news that the UK would walk away from the military aspects of Europes Galileo satellite navigation programme after being told by Brussels it would be excluded from them was said Mr Gyimah a clarion call that EU interest would take precedence after BrexitThe industry has a new minister Chris Skidmore but the consequences of Britains decision are still being digested across the industry Executives worry that while the UK space sector has attracted substantial amounts of private capital over the years the uncertainty over Brexit and Galileo could impact the industrys longerterm ambitionsThere is a view that there is a lot of money to be invested there is venture capital funding here but the issues around Galileo have created uncertainty said one executive who attended the receptionCompanies that have already lost out on contracts for Galileo because of Brexit include Airbus the European aerospace group while others that could be affected include CGI UK formerly Logica and FTSE 250 group Qinetiq British industry has been closely involved in the development of Galileo since its launch in 2003 as the worlds first civilrun satellite navigation system Brussels however had consistently argued that Britain would no longer have access to the secure elements of Galileo when it leaves the EUIn particular it said that under EU law countries outside the bloc cannot have access to Galileos public regulated service PRS an encrypted navigation system for government usersIt is this decision that has hit Airbus which designs and manufactures satellites at its Stevenage site and has run Galileos sensitive ground control operations from Portsmouth The company lost out in a competitive tender for a followon contract this summer Around 100 jobs most of them temporary have been lost at Portsmouth as a result sources close to the company confirmedAirbus subsidiary and a spinout from the University of Surrey Surrey Satellite Technology SSTL which makes the payload or brains for the current generation of Galileo satellites has also been locked out of bidding to provide the fourth batch of satellites for Galileo the first of a new type which is under way Other companies that have played a role on Galileo include CGI UK which has provided much of the encryption used by PRS while Qinetiq is involved in the design and build of PRS receiversImmediate concerns are focused on what will happen with the UKs involvement in another EUwide programme the Copernicus earth observation programme NonEU nationals are not allowed to work on it but both sides say talks on the UKs continued participation are continuing The UK will remain a member of the European Space Agency which is independent of the EUIt would be a limiting glass ceiling for the UK space sector if we cant be involved in EU space said Andrew Shepherd professor of earth observation at the University of LeedsThe UK government has said it will commit 92m towards a national alternative to Galileo but the industry is calling for a wider sector deal to help underpin a domestic space programmeWe have some ad hoc national investment in individual programmesbut what industry really needs now is a sustained national space programme running alongside our investment in the European Space Agency just like other EU countries such as France and Germany said Richard Peckham chair of UKspace the industry trade bodyBritain has set an ambitious target of cornering 10 per cent of the global space market by 2030 in a sector dominated by the US Russia and China Despite the shadow of Brexit looming over some of the larger companies in the industry there is still a strong current of optimismUnlike France or Italy the UK has prioritised investments that will deliver commercial returns As a result the UK space industry is dominated by strong commercial sectors such as broadcasting and communications which account for about threequarters of all income generated by the industry according to a 2016 report by London Economics the research consultancy Total income between 201415 was 137bn Mark Boggett chief executive of Seraphim Capital the worlds first venture fund dedicated to the space industry said while the sector seems to get short changed on the allocation of public funds private capital has been pouring in More venture capital funds have been committed in the last three years in the UK than the previous 15 years combinedAccording to the Seraphim Space Index a publication of global venture capital investment in the space technology sector nine companies in the UK received 32m worth of funding from venture capitalists during the year to end September 2017 In the following year to end September 2018 that figure had increased to 185m invested into 20 companies One area that has seen rapid expansion is the Harwell Space Cluster in Oxfordshire which currently boasts 89 organisations that make up the UKs most concentrated group of commercial public and academic organisations focused on space innovationAngus Horner director of the Harwell Campus Partnership believes the sector is in a more robust state than a decade ago noting that about 44 per cent of the worlds small satellites are made in the UKWe have a very interesting ability to do some things quite well he saidHe concedes that there is immediate project and contract uncertainty for companies affected by Galileo but said he is confident that in the mediumterm there will be a replacement programmeAs part of its industrial strategy launched last year the government has set a target of spending 24 per cent of gross domestic product on research and development across sectors in a bid to improve Britains productivity Mr Horner believes this target will help provide a more strategic focus for the space sectorMark Thomas chief executive of Reaction Engines a company working on a propulsion system that is part jet engine part rocket engine and whose backers include BAE Systems and Boeing said government support has been very important to the companyWith technological advances bringing the possibility of lowcost access to space ever closer industry executives hope the UK will be able to leverage its success to build a truly sustainable industry one backed by a national programme

startups has slowed, dashing hopes of quick windfalls for many investors.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-cooling-on-chinese-technology-startups-11546430400,2019-01-03 02:27:53,The flood of money rushing into Chinese internet startups has slowed dashing hopes of quick windfalls for many investorsJust six months ago investors from the US to Hong Kong were pouring cash into internet companies in China that were raising funds privately or going public sending valuations soaring Then a sharp turn in markets during the summer hammered the share prices of many newly listed tech companies sending a chill through the sector Large investors say there is still money to be made in the sector but they are more selective about what to invest inThousands of private Chinese tech companies raised a record 694 billion in equity financings in 2018 up 63 from 2017 according to CB Insights The sum was also more than triple the 214 billion that Chinese tech firms raised in a busy 2018 for initial public offerings according to Dealogic The volume of stock sales has dropped off sharply of late While some companies are still moving forward with listing plans many have scaled back their fundraising ambitions At least a dozen Chinese tech IPOs have been downsized or postponed in the last couple of months according to bankers and companies that earlier aimed for larger IPOs have had to settle for fractions of their fundraising targetsThey includedTencent Music Entertainment Groupwhich in December priced its New York IPO at the bottom of a proposed range and raised 11 billion or about half of an earlier goal Its market valuation at listing was also 20 less than its earlier targetTurbulent markets are also roiling companies that have yet to go public Were starting to see cracks in private valuations for Chinese technology companies making us cautious in the near term said Anton Levy a managing director and global head of technology at privateequity firm General AtlanticThe result is a funding lull for many smaller companies that could continue for a while Some investors say the correction in private markets could last another six months and that valuations for some firms could even fallSome rationality has returned to Chinas private fundraising industry after years of irrational growth said Zhou Wei founder of China Creation Ventures a venturecapital firm that focuses on earlystage investment in tech and media startups He said tighter liquidity in mainland China has also made domestic investors waryIn hindsight some bankers say several public and private deals were priced too aggressively as investors eagerly bought into companies optimistic growth projectionsSmartphone makerXiaomi Corpand ecommerce bookings appMeituan Dianpingwhich each raised more than 4 billion in Hong Kong IPOs in June and September 2018 have lost more than onefifth of their market value Most of the other IPOs of Chinese tech companies have also underperformed the broader marketSome say the market wasnt ready for the influx of large deals in 2018 A global selloff in tech stocks didnt help eitherBankers are expecting lower IPO volumes in 2019 in Asia compared with 2018 Instead more companies could opt to raise funds through other means such as by issuing convertible bondsStill market volatility doesnt change the longterm opportunities that Chinese tech companies present said Aaron Arth head of the financing group for Asia excluding Japan atGoldman Sachs Group IncInvestors will price that risk he said Some of the noise from geopolitical and market events will impact valuations but it wont impact access to capital broadlyGeneral Atlantics Mr Levy said the privateequity firm remains bullish in the long term on businesses built on stronger foundations and that have the potential to become top players in their fields regionally and globallyEvidence of that comes from some industry frontrunners who have had no trouble attracting investors Bytedance Ltd a Beijingbased startup that operates a popular Chinese newsaggregation app and shortform video platform recently raised 3 billion from private investors in a deal that valued it at 78 billion more than double what the company was worth a year ago Bytedance is also in talks with banks on new credit linesAn IPO of the fastgrowing company could take place as soon as 2019 and investors are expecting other highly valued Chinese tech giants Ant Financial Services Group and ridehailing business Didi Chuxing Technology Co to advance their listing plans in 2019 or 2020Indeed many investors still have large sums of money to put to work even if they have become more discerning about what companies they invest in Asiafocused privateequity and venturecapital funds are sitting on 336 billion in dry powder money they can deploy in companies in the region estimates industry research firm PreqinInvestors are also now in better negotiating positions One tech investor said companies have become more flexible on terms for IPO exits down the roadIn 2017 for instance deal terms often specified that investors who provided private capital could redeem their investments if the companies hadnt gone public after five years More recently some agreements have shortened that wait to three or four years adding some urgency for companies to move toward listingsStella Yifan Xie

is the next big thing,https://www.ft.com/content/3d6b3e4c-01ef-11e9-bf0f-53b8511afd73,2019-01-02 05:04:34,My local pet shop recently shut down and was taken over by a much grander more luxurious pet emporium offering all manner of therapies for mutts and tabbies Prices have shot up and the shop is busier than ever But at least it is cheaper than the local vets which also reports booming business It is currently fighting off a takeover by a big private equity backed chain one of many rationalising a national network of once partnerowned outfits Or at least thats what the junior vet at the practice claims as she attempts to inject our reluctant German shepherd for the fourth time this yearWelcome to the new pet economy It is a sector that has seen a relentless pace of growth and offers interesting investment opportunities as a result Every pet owner seems fixated on spending money on their furry loved ones According to US fund manager Gabelli millennials are the largest petowning generation of all Of the age group 38 per cent have dogs and 35 per cent have cats As for Baby Boomers 31 per cent have dogs and 32 per cent cats The biggest market of course is in the US On the other side of the pond seven out of 10 US households today have pets According to the blurb for yet another US asset manager Proshares this is more than the number that have children Owners are providing pets with premium foods luxury services stateoftheart healthcare insurance policies and moreBut whats true for the US is also true for the rest of the world I was recently in India where the middle classes there are showing off their expensive mutts with pride while in China the omnipotent CCTV monitoring system is targeting careless middleclass dog owners who dont clean up after canine pooches Fund managers and especially exchangetraded fund ETF issuers love nothing better than a big new trend and pet ownership is the next big thing Only a few months ago we saw the emergence of a new fund from Proshares called the Pet Care ETF with the fantastic US ticker of PAWZ Get it This joins another fund from Gabelli called Nextshares Petparents fund with a ticker again US based of PETXC Unlike many trends orientated thematic funds I can sort of see the logic behind this obsession with pets In my humble experience all pet owners are concerned with three thingsThe first is that their vet bills are too high A standard procedure by a local vet can easily set you back a few hundred pounds so any way of cutting down bills will be welcome The next universal runs counter to the first We will of course spend insane amounts of money on our pets if it can make them happier keep them alive longer or just make them look cuter Thus the market for ridiculously expensive therapies is booming The last given is that visiting a pet shop to buy a bone is a lessthanthrilling consumer experience in the age of ecommerce Thus my local pet shop has turned into a veritable new age emporium full of therapies and services This also opens up the market for directtoconsumer propositions such as PetMed Express the USs largest pet pharmacy online and a core holding of many of the petobsessed funds in this spaceBooming online sales also brings us to the obvious risks with some of these mega growth stories nice trend pity about the actual stocks suggested On paper the UK stock market boasts one of the best ways of accessing the pets theme namely listed business Pets at Home This came to the market in 2014 boasting access to all the trends I have articulatedAt one point its share price shot above 300p but since then the retailers shares have beaten a steady retreat back to about 120p a share The problem Falling profit margins as ecommerce competition has hotted up with margins declining from over 13 per cent to not much above 5 per cent Changes in the vet stores business have been associated with all sorts of restructuring costs But my own sense is that this price decline may have gone too far This business is still far more profitable than most other outoftown retailers and sales are continuing to grow The market is forecasting a 5 per cent increase in sales even though profits might tack back a bit more The vet business looks like it is back in shape and the shares trade on a dividend yield of more than 6 per cent and a forward priceearnings ratio of about 94Another UK business called Dechra Pharmaceuticals also features in these pet portfolios and here it is easier to understand the investment rationale Dechra makes most of the vet products whose high costs we all complain about and its margins are hugely impressive Its shares are up 4 per cent over the past year well above the benchmark and it trades at a pricey 25 times earnings But sales are growing fast likely to increase 13 per cent this coming year the threeyear average growth rate has been running at 26 per cent a year and the return on equity is a princely 185 per cent Another quality way to play this theme is Idexx Labs which trades on the US market Its shares are up a whopping 18 per cent over the last year and currently it trades at an eye watering 45 times forecast earnings Like Dechra this US business is big in the world of vets mainly supplying all manner of small animal analysers and tests Last but by no means least theres the aforementioned PetMed Express the US online pets business In recent years its shares have crashed from a peak of over 50 a share to the current 22 a share Rather like our very own Pets at Home this now trades arguably rather like a value stock with a price to earnings ratio of just 10 and a forecast dividend yield of over 45 per cent Sales are forecast to advance by 8 per cent in the coming year As we spend ever more money on our pets it could see a rebound in the share price as long as Amazon stays out of its marketDavid Stevenson is an active private investor He has interests in securities where mentioned Emailadventurousftcom

financial crisis the culmination of a rout that threatens to halt the longestever bull marketThe Nasdaq Composite became the first domino to fall Friday sliding into a bear market as trading volumes surged to the highest daily level in more than seven years The decline of more than 20 from Nasdaqs Aug 29 high marks a sharp reversal for the benchmark which is dominated by the technology giants that powered the broader stock market higher for much of the bullmarket run that began in March 2009The intensifying selloff since late August has erased about 12 trillion in market value from Facebook Amazoncom Apple Netflix Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft leaving the stock market without a clear leaderThose widely held stocks tumbled again Friday with Netflix Facebook and Amazon down

specter of a recession That along with the fading benefit of the corporate tax cut the USs ongoing trade spat with China and a looming government shutdown have led investors to pare back their riskier

has gripped the stock market analysts said so much so that comments from a Federal Reserve official Friday morning signaling greater flexibility in the central banks pace of interestrate increases did little to ease anxieties that had been heightened since Wednesdays decision to hike rates a fourth time this year Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said on CNBC that the central bank is closely watching to see whether the economy will slow down next year adding officials arent sitting there saying we know for sure whats going to happenThe Fed is reconsidering its take on the economy Mr Williams added listening to not only markets but everybody that we talk to looking at all the data and being ready to reassess and reevaluate our views The comments initially sent the Dow up more than 350 points But the bluechip index gave up those gains and turned negative as the day wore on a sign of investors fatigue as to whether the economy truly is on solid footing The Fed is

creating a monopoly on entertainment,https://www.ft.com/content/13078a02-0465-11e9-99df-6183d3002ee1,2018-12-28 05:00:25,How have you been spending the holiday period Regardless of faith or family many of us will have lost an afternoon evening or possibly even 10 days straight sprawled in front of the televisionIf you are one of the 130m people worldwide who subscribe to Netflix there is a high possibility that this week you will have watched one of the following The Christmas Chronicles a family film starring Kurt Russell which had 20m downloads within three weeks of its release the Spanishlanguage film Roma set in 1970s Mexico directed by Alfonso Cuarn and already tipped to win an Oscar Mowgli a liveaction adventure based around the Jungle Book novels or Bird Box an apocalyptic thriller starring Sandra BullockPerhaps you havent yet seen any of them In which case you should probably hurry up and do so because youll need to have an opinion about one or preferably all by the time you return to your desk Netflix is one subject that transcends geopolitical boundaries national interests and generation gapsIn the five years since it started streaming original content weve become a bunch of bingewatching insatiables desperate for entertainment and the hit of the whats next Other channels exist of course Amazon Prime HBO and the venerable BBC among them all delivering their own acclaimed series Bob Iger Disneys chief executive plans to launch a Disney streaming service next year An ATampT streamer is also planned But no other brand has come close to claiming Netflixs reachMore shows more watching more watching more subs more subs more revenue more revenue more content Ted Sarandos Netflixs chief content officer told New York Magazine this year when asked to outline his model for growth The phrase Netflix and chill first entered the lexicon in 2013 These days were just NetflixedAnd yet for all the whoopdedo Netflixs overwhelming dominance has made some wary Over 2018 at least half a dozen fashion designers told me how they were inspired by the prestige drama The Crown in their own collections Others have cited the saffronrobed cultists of the Wild Wild Country documentary as their muse Could such a cultural hegemony be dulling our creative outputOthers meanwhile wonder whether the network can sustain its quality offering when it is now making so many programmes And to what extent are these lauded shows merely windowdressing for a platform on which original content makes up only a fraction of its views According to TV analyst Ampere original programmes constitute only 8 per cent of Netflix content watched when measured in hours Are we really watching foreignlanguage documentaries or are we actually schlubbing out over old repeats of FriendsHave you seen the movie WALLE asks Christopher Wylie the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower who takes an especially dystopian view of the future which he likens to the Pixar drama about the last robot on Earth Its not necessarily 1984 its not necessarily Brave New World Its actually almost worse than that because its so lame he says We destroy the planet because it becomes completely uninhabitable and we move it into outer space where the spaceship which is powered by AI pacifies and infantilises all humans that live on it And they float around as fat slobs watching whatever personalised entertainment system thats there and that becomes what it is to be humanFew others are so pessimistic but many are worried that the network is building a monopoly with plans to leave us with nothing to watch but commercial sap Ive heard a lot of people in the industry say that Netflix is the CocaCola of the audiovisual industry says one television and film producer who prefers to remain anonymous as is often the case when youre speaking about the most powerful entertainment company aroundTheres an argument that they come blundering in saying Heres a shiny new model and weve got loads of money very much like Coke when they go into a country And they build a shiny new factory or they will give one particular factory loads and loads of money and put all of the competitors out of work And then the moment theyve monopolised the market they slash all of their wages Theres a fear that theyll put the competition out of business and then charge whatever price they likeThe danger is that you get a lot of dross to fill up what they imagine the appetite of the public is And its like having too much sugarI think thats a slightly exaggerated view of what theyre doing he continues But undoubtedly theyve inflated prices for established talent so suddenly bigname writers actors and directors can be paid very large fees to do TV shows And the tendency has been to draw those people away from terrestrial channels So there is a bit of a talent drain going on from the UK to America And everybody feels compelled to compete Whats interesting over the past year say in the UK is that costs have probably risen between 15 and 20 per cent and some of that is the Netflix effect But its not just the Netflix effect its also the Amazon effect and other global playersThats absolute rubbish says Peter Morgan writer and showrunner of The Crown Morgan who first met the Netflix team when it was operating out of a portacabin in Beverly Hills was persuaded to go with them when making The Crown because it married a British drama about what might be thought quite stuffy subject matter with a newly disruptive production house that he found inspiring and releasingThe series debuted in November 2016 to coincide with the international push that saw Netflix operating in 190 countries Immediately it was a critical and popular smash and season three of The Crown is now in productionCast and crew from The Crown after its win at 2017s Golden Globes including second from left series producer Andy Harries Claire Foy centre and writer Peter Morgan third from right  CapHFPA  Capital PicturesThey have an uncomplicated mandate to entertain and I think that that has led to charges of them being like a Walmart because they have so much of everything and they dont have a particular line or objective or goal in the way that FX does or HBO says Morgan But I just dont understand this talk of talent drains Talent will go wherever talent is given a home and its not about the money I think we can all agree that whether its a little podcast or a blockbuster television show spending money isnt the secret to success He insists that reports of The Crowns 10manepisode budget are horribly exaggeratedMorgan is adamant that Netflix has been a force for cultural good I can understand if you are new into the job as a commissioner at say one of the terrestrial broadcasters that it must be a bit harder to get premiumquality content he says But from the point of view of the filmmakers I think its a lovely moment There used to be a time where all you would hear about was the star system And thats no fing fun if youre a writer or a filmmaker or a director and basically your entire existence is predicated upon some infant narcissist deranged creature surrounded by sycophants saying yes or no to a piece thats suitably flattering to them Im far happier being in this universe where writers and producers are starting to get more of an upper handMorgan believes that far from creating a monopoly the competition has opened things up Theres never been more people in jobs theres never been more work being done I think theres a lot to be happy about Netflix has stimulated a huge amount of competition The BBC is making more drama Channel 4 is making drama Sky is making drama I dont know a writer that is out of work You cant get a soundstage You cant get a postproduction house Its impossible to book actors theyre all busy Everybody seems to be in workOther producers agree that Netflix has done much to stimulate the market experimenting with new formats and genres that might once have been deemed too niche It has broadened our taste in unexpected ways whether its for Finnish crime dramas Deadwind or German scifi thrillers Dark Meanwhile smaller independent films that may not have had much exposure on general release have been given a second successful life Its one of the few elements about being British we can still hold our heads up about says Morgan You think about the brand of being British which is so corrupted and devalued right now that you hold your head in shame And then you realise Britains reputation is being held up by its cultural exportsMorgan was lucky He walked into a room with the right idea at the right time And he has been handsomely remunerated for it What is more surprising perhaps is the extent to which he and his team were given free rein by Netflix to do what they wanted One imagines a bunch of Silicon Valley techies devising scenes by scriptbot But the truth was quite the oppositeHonestly they did leave us alone says the series producer Andy Harries And I think we have rewarded them with really really great work But I have to say he adds I think were a very responsible team So we were trusted and delivered for themHarries cofounder and chief executive of the UK production company Left Bank Pictures recently signed another deal with Netflix to produce a new bilingual drama White Lines which is set in Ibiza and is a coproduction with the Spanish production company owned by Alex Pina the showrunner behind the global hit La casa de papel Money HeistTheres no question that their desire to grow as fast as they have means that they are commissioning tons and tons of stuff he says of Netflixs expansion And commissioning isnt cheap as of September 30 2018 Netflix reported 834bn in longterm debtWhether it can keep up its current hit rate is more of a challenge In a sense theyve created a different world for people in the way that they look at things and in the way they watch things says another producer who prefers to speak offrecord So it has revolutionised viewing and it has created some very good drama and documentary and movies The problem is that the machine has to be fed and so you cant keep feeding it with good stuff because as in everything theres only so many good things And so the danger is that you get a lot of dross to fill up what they imagine the appetite of the public is And its like having too much sugarTed Sarandos left Netflixs chief content officer with the channels head of original film Scott Stuber  PA ImagesMost producers suggest that algorithms are playing at least a part in Netflixs content Data is very very important says Harries pragmatically Theyre a tech company and tech companies are very very research and dataobsessed Theres a sense also that commissioners across all platforms are becoming more careful The grip is getting tighter And no wonder Netflix can illafford another disaster such as Baz Luhrmanns Bronxset musical drama The Get Down which went wildly over budget premiered this summer to a lukewarm critical response and was then promptly cancelledBut Netflix itself is quick to push back on the idea that it is becoming more datadriven Theres no way an algorithm could have predicted that a show steeped in 1980s nostalgia and starring four unknown kids like Stranger Things would have been a huge success says Netflix spokesman Jonathan Bennett And actually we have very little data on our subscribers When you sign up you give your name and email payment details so we dont even know what country you live in or your gender All we know is your viewing tastesIts these viewing tastes that help inform the taste clusters that feed the different recommendations on the Netflix dashboard Today for example my dashboard is encouraging me to make good on a 99 per cent match with the new Netflix film Dumplin about a Texas teenager who enters herself into a local pageant one of whose judges is her former beauty queen mother played by Jennifer Aniston and somewhat mortifyingly suggesting that I will enjoy the 2006 romantic comedy The Holiday a 98 per cent match We might suggest content you might not normally have watched says Bennett Or indeed content I will never ever watch and which got clustered via a reading of my daughters viewing tastesTheres no way an algorithm could have predicted that a show like Stranger Things would have been a huge successViewing figures are not the only measure adds Bennett We also look at social media to see how much buzz a show is getting And whether a new show is pulling new subscribers in And yes we do take risks and we make mistakes But I think a measure of our success should be the number of industry accolades our original shows are getting Success isnt measured in a time slotMaybe not but new shows today have less time to make a good impression than they once had They know within a month how many people have watched it and if people are not watching beyond an hour or two they just cancel the shows theyre gone says one producer Its pretty savage Another producer bemoans the issue with promotion After all if youve only got one portal to go to and there are more and more shows how do you stand outIn the meantime the numbers keep growing Many in the industry assume that theyll one day sell to Amazon or another big competitor such as Apple For the time being however its clear that theyre way out front And theres no point in trying to stop themI am optimistic says Harries But Im conscious that all things change Ive been too long in this business not to have seen many ups and downs and challenges Getting into the originals game is a very very expensive business But its a ride I mean there is no question that the openingup of the streamers has completely changed the business Its been transformative It blows all the cobwebs off the old sort of terrestrial channels But its everchanging and you certainly cant take it for granted Its a crazy business but its enormous fun Youve got to just strap yourself in and go for itIn the meantime the rest of us will no doubt stay glued to our sofasFounded in 1997 by chief executive Reed Hastings and tech entrepreneur Marc Randolph Netflix first began streaming in 2007 but it wasnt until 2013 with the premiere of its first original drama House of Cards that it emerged as a content creator in its own rightToday it has around 130m paying subscribers 73m of whom live outside the US 9m in the UK and a subscription growth that some analysts predict will hit 300m by 2028 It accounts for 15 per cent of all internet bandwidth worldwide and the company recently surpassed Disney to become at 1538bn the most valued media company in the worldAnd the output is growing and growing and growing Next year Netflix is expected to spend up to 13bn on content of which the majority will be spent on original programming Its also making a more strategic effort to build its global profile In 2018 Netflix had 141 projects in Europe 40 of which were based in the UK and the channel is planning to launch 100 foreignlanguage originals within the next two years Many will be developed at the

open a new headquarters in Long Island City Queens she hopes the online retailer will one day hire her in her hometownIt could have been Manhattan it could have been Brooklyn but its Queens the College Point Queens native saidTo have Amazon here in my community it makes it even more so something I want to achieve in the futureSince Amazon announced in November it had selected New York City and Virginia as the home of its newest headquarters elected officials have boasted of the benefit to local residents Amazon expects to bring 25000 jobs to each location over the next 10 yearsMayor Bill de Blasio and Gov Andrew Cuomo said the deal will be the biggest boon to City University of New York students like Ms Masab and publichousing residents especially in QueensThe mayor has touted these job opportunities in response to local politicians and community leaders who have criticized city and state officials for negotiating the Long Island City deal with Amazon behind closed doorsThe agreement provides 3 billion in city and state incentives to Amazon with 12 billion contingent on the company bringing the 25000 jobs in the next decade Amazon plans to bring 700 jobs to Long Island City by 2019If youre a student in our public schools who hopes to get a job in tech or youre a CUNY student who hopes to get a job in tech you probably really like the Amazon deal right Mr de Blasio a

budgets cutMr Thompson said the university is supporting the project because it will benefit students Im confident that well be at the table that well be working along with the city and the state as well as Amazon to make sure its a good deal for CUNY students he saidAmazon executives have said theyre committed to hiring locally and selected New York City in part because of its workforce and

return,https://www.ft.com/content/b9ef082e-052b-11e9-9d01-cd4d49afbbe3,2018-12-23 14:36:03,At what point does bad corporate behaviour become wilful malfeasance That is a question that regulators and politicians in both the US and Europe are considering carefully in regards to Facebook given the new revelations that it allowed a number of big companies Apple Amazon and Microsoft among them to tap sensitive user data even as it was promising to protect privacy Watching the weekly drumbeat of allegations around the social networking site is like watching the same swirl around US president Donald Trump I feel that it may only be a matter of time until the subject of interest as prosecutors would put it is brought down But even if Facebooks conduct is found to be lawful its story holds lessons in the risks of putting growth before governance Facebook entered into the datasharing deals between 2010 and 2017 to grow its social network as fast as possible That increased its profit margins by lowering costs per user on the platform But according to The New York Times which broke the news neither Facebook nor the other companies involved could keep track of all the implications of the arrangements for user privacyApple claims to not even know it was in such a deal with Facebook a rather stunning admission given the way in which that company has been marketing itself as a protector of user privacy At Facebook some engineers and executivesconsidered the privacy reviews an impediment to quick innovation and growth read a telling line in the Times piece And grow it has last year Facebook took in more than 40bn in revenue more than double the 179bn it reported for 2015 Facebooks prioritisation of growth over governance is egregious but not unique There is a broader crisis in corporate governance that is much bigger and deeper than this one company alone Facebook provides three telling examples of this First it is part of a group of very big companies that want to act like they are still small This issue is most pronounced in the tech sector since the groups tend to be young ones that grew very quickly Such companies often have too much power concentrated at the top Facebook founder chief executive and chairman Mark Zuckerberg still controls 60 per cent of the companys voting rights and his board appears to be totally ineffectual Recent reports suggest that he and chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg represented a tiny funnel through which decisions had to flow That is something more characteristic of a startup than one of the worlds most profitable public companies Neither Mr Zuckerberg nor Ms Sandberg wanted to hear anything they didnt like according to people who have spoken to the two Facebook executives since the 2016 election meddling scandal which creates a massive governance issue in itself Elon Musk had a similar stranglehold on power at Tesla until the US Securities and Exchange Commission forced him to relinquish the chairmanship as part of a fraud settlement Google has the problem too Larry Page Sergey Brin and Eric Schmidt still own the largest chunks of the company and have tremendous influence Secondly Facebooks failure to invest in risk management isnt singular Its early motto of move fast and break things meant executive were willing to enter datasharing deals they didnt understand with companies that didnt understand them either This reminds me of bank executives who had no understanding of the risks built into their balance sheets until markets started to blow up during the 2008 financial crisis That underscores another point which is the tendency of companies to prioritise what can be quantified such as earnings per share and the ratio of the stock price to earnings and ignore until it is too late the business risks that are harder to measure Think not just of data breaches and privacy scandals but also of any number of complex supply chain disasters such as the Rana Plaza building collapse in Bangladesh that killed workers making clothes for prominent retail chainsNone of this should come as a surprise Facebook is the natural culmination of 40 years of business worshipping at the altar of shareholder value The idea that profits should be the only goal of business first posited by the Chicago school of economics has been taken to extremes by platform technology groups that build global networks and leverage intangible assets Their business model has so far allowed them to largely avoid national control and concerns not to mention tax The big tech groups also tend to be run by a generation of leaders that came of age in the 1980s and 1990s after many business schools began emphasising the importance of maximising shareholder valueBut economic globalisation has run far ahead of political globalisation sparking much of the populism and the backlash against the establishment we see all around us And growth has triumphed over governanceThe question now is what happens next Corporate leaders have a long history of doing whatever it takes to maximise profits until they are forced to reconsider Have we reached one of those watersheds when US and European authorities are going to step up and do something about it ranaforooharftcom

I see its value it was unexpected and scary but also edifyingThat travel has always had this power is axiomatic Now a handful of adventuretravel operators is leveraging that axiom to their and their

everything in which case theyre often dealing with a real lack of purpose or direction says Geordie MackayLewis a director of Pelorus a highend adventure and yachtexpedition company he cofounded with

MackayLewis continues It can be harrowing but our appreciation rates are high We get That was quite a rough night in that jungle in the middle of nowhere on my own with no reception or whatever it was

client isone he calls Unknown Friends family PAs are interviewed about the client interests and proclivities but also issues and phobias Due diligence on health and fitness is done and a surprise itinerary crafted One group were dropped in the Middle East thinking they were going somewhere else entirely They were told at short notice what each day entailed navigating on their own fromJerusalem across the desert to the Jordanian border abseiling in Wadi Rum because acouple of the clients suffered from a fear of heights Through all these experiences they were coming up against obstacles fears frustration But the payoff he says is real They regain a sense of achievement Some of them had never camped in thedesert most had never navigated with a map and compass he notes MackayLewis shadowed the expedition for its duration though he can arrange for clients to go solo tracked remotely with helicopters on standby to facilitate aid if necessary Andif one of them in exhaustion or just a fit of pique had thrown a strop and demanded out The brief is clear Fora lot of clients being told no is not something theyre used to its way outside their comfort zone he says They know the deal barring

stars foraging for food and medicine He will send clients to the Kalahari Desert in Botswana for instance to shadow Zuhoasi bushmen for aweek during which rites of initiation are held or into Transylvania to spend days with a cowherd in the mountains well out of signal range with a genuine threat of wolves and bears At the end of each day they wander down from the hills and the cows peel off to their respective barns where they are milked by hand This is the way its happened every evening for hundreds of years and it gives real perspective on contemporary problemsA group of explorers

who feeling existentially at sea after a serious health crisis wanted to examine his spirituality virgin territory for him WilmotSitwell arranged for him to spend several weeks touring northern India on foot in the company of a retired Buddhist monk The idea was basically life detox and spiritual reengagement says WilmotSitwell He overnighted in some lovely places private homestays but I also did quite a bit of fixing in monasteries The client was taught meditation he practised with a yogi who was sent in occasionally but the monks focus was to school him above all in how to switch off It was a completely different physical mental and intellectual environment for him but it was all about him The contract was lets pare it all down so he can see what he is and commence building it up againHarry Hastings managing director of Plan South America has a soughtafter life coach with whom he regularly collaborates on experiences Together they consider the challenges and benefits of various climates environments and indigenous communities across the continent calibrating for the specific needs of each case A recent experience for a client confronting addiction issues involved several days living with the Spara tribe in the Ecuadorian Amazon accompanied by the life coach They trekked in the jungle daily and swam in the Ro Conambo She had her dreams interpreted by a shaman and participated in tribal rituals Hastings says The experience concluded with a stay at a working hacienda in the highlands a completely different climate culture landscape Its cosy and comfortable she was riding observing conservation initiatives But it was an ideal environment to process with a different perspective the jungle experience with her coachLike most of the other experts I spoke to Henry Cookson the former banker Guinness World Record holder for reaching the Antarctic Pole of Inaccessibility without mechanical aid and founder of Cookson Adventures works regularly with family offices He hasplanned elaborate bonding adventures for parents with children from whom they feel estranged and selfdiscovery experiences for young people set to inherit daunting responsibilities I work regularly with a guy who mentors the children of wealthy families When there are perceived succession problems say hes veryskilled at guiding them to insights about their issuesor feelings Hesgot the keys in place in terms of psychological and emotional care which helps me take itto the next level with the adventure He sees the mentoring potential in the conservationists and philanthropists on the ground too occasionally fostering relationships between them and his clients Ialready consider that a conservation or community element will usually enhance awareness of the world beyond their own he saysThe person who has articulated this phenomenon in both the widest and deepest terms and arguably its progenitor is Calum Morrison founder of the Extraordinary Adventure Club Morrison works by personal recommendation only and proposes ongoing engagement as opposed to oneoff experiences one family has worked with him for five years Its about getting your compass bearings again identifying your values he says For many people theres a divergence between the life theyre living and those authentic bearings and the greater the divergence the more pain or lack of fulfilment they experience Every EAC client comes to the companys base in Scotland for a fourday initial retreat a sleeper train from London to Aberdeen a drive across two rivers and through a forest to a place deep in the Highlands with no signal and a full support team Physical and psychological assessments are taken benchmarks provisionally indicated and programmes created Morrison uses what he calls the Hollywood teamconstructing method bespoke groupings that might include life coaches or scientists entrepreneurs or dance instructors actors or psychotherapists There are no phones no laptops no connectivity here or on the eventual adventure Transformation requires endeavour Morrison notes You have to find the edge of your capabilities and push them out Thats where we come into create programmes that stretch you We can do itallover the globe with a specific focus on your developmental imperativeSerioussounding stuff But the point is not to forbear enjoyment entirely We like the idea of a journey or engaging with indigenous culture he says If theres a personalinterest thread that can help pull someone through great Thus if desert and antiquities came up as passions in one clients assessment Morrison might dispatch them to Sudan to get the deep work done if another always fantasised about a motorcycle journey the Mongolian steppes might figure But ultimately the travel is a lever to create change Morrison says It doesnt really matter where you take them Its about what happens when youre there 439

01:45:14,WASHINGTONDemocrats are in a deepening internal battle over voter data seen as key in helping get out the vote ahead of looming 2020 presidential elections correspondence reviewed by The Wall Street Journal shows The party is struggling to catch up with Republican efforts to collect and store voter data that allows politicians to directly target their voter outreach But a growing battle between the Democratic National Committee and state parties about how to handle the process is threatening the partys unity as the primary period approaches and candidates turn to voter lists to try to build support Under the current setup state parties collect data and the DNC covers the cost of cleaning up and analyzing it Democrats want to upgrade the data sets adding information such as email addresses social media accounts and mobile phone numbers The DNC has proposed mimicking the Republican National Committees data project setting up a separate trust to warehouse the information and license it to all members of the party and allies including super PACs and other outside groups But in an email Friday the leader of state Democratic parties suggested rejecting the DNCs plan Ken Martin president of the Association of State Democratic Committees proposed to his members that state parties cut out the DNC altogether and instead work with a forprofit company with whom they have an existing financial relationship That company TargetSmart gives state parties a commission when it licenses their raw voter data to its other clients TargetSmart has worked with state and national Democratic parties for more than a decade TargetSmart Chief Executive Tom Bonier said My first priority and goal is to protect our state parties and make sure that our number one asset our voter file remains firmly in our grasp and control Mr Martin wrote He said members would hold a conference call about the matter on Monday DNC Chairman Tom Perez responded in a lengthy Saturday email to state party chairmen and executive directors sounding the alarm about Mr Martins alternative For some inexplicable reason this proposal would tear down just about everything about our current data structure reversing so much of the progress we made over the past decade Mr Perez wrote In short we are perplexed and dumbfounded by this proposal Since 2005 the DNC and state parties have shared a national data set of voter information starting with voter rolls provided by state election officials and enriched by information that candidates and Democratic allies gathered during campaigns by knocking on doors and calling home phones The more data points the easier it is for candidates and party committees to decide which messages to use in communicating with different types of voters For years Democrats were ahead of Republicans in their collection and use of such data strategists in both parties said That began to change in 2011 when the RNC under thenchairman Reince Priebus began building its own voter data set That set is held in an outside trust so that all candidates party committees and outside groups can access it without running afoul of the Federal Election Commission prohibitions on coordination The GOP voter data includes digital information whereas the Democratic data is heavy on physical information such as home addresses and inperson contacts The DNC is seeking to start its own outside trust just as the RNC did Mr Martin said that is legally riskyand puts too much power outside of the party committee The FEC ruled unanimously that the Republican setup is permissible The DNC doesnt even realize they are potentially slitting their own throats here Mr Martin said Saturday adding that he is preparing an emailed response to Mr Perez Theres nothing to suggest that an outside trust would act in the best interest of the state parties and the DNC Many people have been trying to get their hands on this data for years Under Mr Martins proposal the state parties would feed their data to TargetSmart and other corporate data partners instead of to the DNC or its proposed data trust The DNC is welcome to participate that process he said But Mr Perez said there are problems with that plan including that state parties would have to foot the bill for tasks that had been covered by the DNC The GOP was behind us and now theyre ahead of us on data said Ron Klain who worked in the Obama administration and now leads a Democratic technology incubator called Higher Ground Labs It is very painful to see that Mr Klain said he had been briefed on the rift between DNC officials and the state parties The products developed through Higher Ground use voter data I understand the skepticism of We are behind so why should we trust the DNC to fix this he said But the presumption should be that the DNC serves as the epicenter for the data Thats worked really well for the Republicans and its a good model for us to follow Mr Klain said Democrats have until about March or April to complete their voter data plans because that is when state election officials begin releasing updated voter rolls Adding to the stress the party is about to begin a presidential primary period that could include 20 or more Democratic candidates One of the first things a presidential candidate often does is ask for the Democrats national data set I dont know why in a year like 2020 anyone would contemplate blowing up a very important partnership said Mary Beth Cahill a DNC consultant who has been urging the state parties to adopt the DNCs strategy I completely accept that their priority is the same as oursto win This is not a way to win Ken Thomas contributed to this article Write to Julie Bykowicz at juliebykowiczwsjcom

criminal networks to spread and disguise their illicit business andor move hot potato style from one service provider to the next as they get frozen out Since many of their strategies involve the

something were keeping an eye on as we start to think about the opportunities there and growth in that space Lucy Brady McDonalds senior vicepresident of corporate strategy told a womens conference in California hosted by Fortune magazine in December It is hardly a surprise that the popularity of meat alternatives has caught the attention of the leading fast food company An increasing number of large food and agricultural companies have been investing in alternative protein groups US meat group Tyson Foods has taken a stake in plant based meat company Beyond Meat leading agricultural trader Cargill has invested in cellular meat startup Memphis Meats and Unilever bought a Dutch plantbased food company Vegetarian ButcherThe consumer trend described by food and marketing executives as a paradigm shift seems to be driven largely by concerns about health and weight loss but it comes as worries increase over greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and food productionOver the past four to five years the spotlight on agriculture and food industries impact on the environment has intensified amid fears over the prospect of population growth and food demand driving crop and livestock cultivation You can see there is a path to greatly reduce emissions in energy and transport and all of a sudden agriculture emissions look big Off the agricultural total livestock is the big factor said Channing Arndt director of environment at the International Food Policy Research Institute a developmental thinktankFood and agricultural production accounts for about a quarter of all global emissions with twothirds of that coming from the livestock sector according to data from the UN Food and Agriculture OrganizationAmid that backdrop leading institutional investors are raising their concerns about the risks of investing in the food and agricultural sectors Farm Animal Investment Risk and Return FAIRR an investor network that advocates sustainable animal farming backed by 180 fund managers with assets of 105tn said 70 per cent of the worlds 60 largest publicly listed meat dairy and aquaculture producers are failing to manage climate risk Across the animal protein sector reporting and management of greenhouse gas emissions is inadequate unstandardised and unverified the network warned in a report FAIRR whose members include leading asset managers such as Aviva Schroders and University of Californias investment assets also pointed out that most of the sector was putting longterm growth at risk by failing to invest in alternative protein businesses Only five out of the 60 groups have backed plantbased meat alternatives grown in laboratories as well as dairy alternatives These include Tyson Hormel Foods Canadas Maple Leaf China Mengniu Dairy and Vietnam DairyThe investor network in a separate report said that of the 16 global food companies both manufacturers and retailers only six Marks and Spencer Tesco Walmart General Mills Nestl and Unilever have targets to reduce supply chain emissions from livestock agriculture Changes in feed vaccines and selective breeding are potential ways to lower the livestock emissions of methaneSome companies are looking to technology to alleviate the livestock emissions problem Changes in feed vaccines and selective breeding are being tested as ways to lower the livestock emissions of methane a potent greenhouse gas whose comparative impact is more than 25 times greater than carbon dioxide over a 100year periodCargill partnering with natural feed ingredient companies is testing different feed mixes and their effects on methane gas production in a simulated cattle stomach Startups such as Swiss company Mootral has created a natural feed supplement using garlic and citrus extracts while others are turning to seaweedTo combat other causes of agricultural emissions large seeds and chemicals groups are also turning to innovation and RampD Companies such as Bayer are launching insecticides that can tackle a range of pests and caterpillars as well as seeds developed to increase yields and work with crop protection toolsMicrobes are among the cuttingedge technologies in agriculture where companies hope to cut the use of synthetic chemicals such as pesticides and fertilisers to protect plants as well as increased yields According to scientists increased fertiliser use over the past 50 years is linked to a dramatic rise in atmospheric nitrous oxide a leading greenhouse gas contributing to global climate changeIndustrial biotechnology group Novozymes and US agritech startup Indigo are among those with products that coat seeds with microbiomes while Pivot Bio has launched a microbial product that adheres to the root and delivers nitrogen to the plantHowever analysts point out that many of the companies are reacting to the farmers need to cut costs and use less inputs than being driven by a desire to be environmentally friendly Its largely not sustainability that is driving the new products Inadvertently you might end up with something with an environmental impact said Jonas Oxgaard at Bernstein Research There are some agribusiness executives are trying to drive sustainability by putting forward the creation of broader platforms to promote sustainable productionAmong the leading grains produced globally rice is an important staple for more than half the worlds population But it is also a leading contributor of methane Olam the Singaporebased agricultural trader is working with a German development agency and a growers project in Thailand on climate smart practices At an industry gathering in October the traders chief executive Sunny Verghese called on the implementation of a sustainable rice platform which promotes solutions to limit methane emissions from rice production through a network of stakeholders to support farmers growing sustainable rice crops Mr Verghese urged agronomists to promote sustainable practices banks and insurers to lower charges for farmers growing sustainable rice and brand owners and retailers to support sustainable rice products While there are no overarching climate policy initiatives guiding agriculture and food companies the sectors are likely to come under increasing pressure by consumers investors and policymakers over the next few years say analysts IFPRIs Mr Arndt said as calls for a policy framework for agricultural and food production increase companies should be involved in the debate Theres a big challenge coming up over the next decade for agricultural companies Corporations should be ready for that They need to be at the table

western region of Xinjiang is being replicated in other parts of the country particularly in areas with other Muslim communitiesOver the past year or so as Xinjiang stepped up its program of mass surveillance detention and assimilation of Muslims droves of lawenforcement officials from across China have traveled there to study the techniquesand adapt them for their home regionsOne result is that the small multipurpose police stations that are ubiquitous in urban Xinjiang are cropping up in neighboring provinces In Zhongning county a placid agricultural stretch of the northwestern Ningxia region known for producing goji berries authorities set up a pilot policeservices work station Housed in a twofloor building within a residential compound the station hosts six officers who offer community services such as mediating disputes alongside security functions tapping into a network of surveillance cameras blanketing the countys streets to enforce orderRows of Muslimrun restaurants and butcher shops have replaced their halalfood signage to remove Arabic text a change locals say was enforced over the past year as part of new rules curbing Islamic practicesElsewhere security cameras are trained on many mosques across neighboring Gansu and Qinghai provinces Surveillance tools widely used in Xinjiang such as devices that extract data stored on mobile phones are being used by police departments elsewhere including Beijing and Shanghai according to government procurement documentsXinjiang has been at the forefront in deploying surveillance technology and aggressive policing to deal with what Beijing sees as antigovernment terrorist violence fueled by militant Islam The spreading of lessons learned there shows how the region is serving as a laboratory for Chinas authoritarian leadership as it tries to control people and extinguish threats to its ruleXinjiang is front and center of Beijings efforts to develop a 21st century version of Maoist social controls fused with modern technology said Carl Minzner a Fordham University professor who studies Chinese law and governance It is easy to envision how such security measures could steadily proliferate as Chinese authorities progressively target one group after another that they deem problematic Those targets he said include Chinas large Christian community and prodemocracy activists in Hong Kong as well as Muslims in western ChinaWider deployment of harderedged security tools and tactics dovetails with a broader Communist Party campaign to sinicize Islam and Christianity Chinese leaders see those religions as foreign to China and want to eradicate symbols and practices that engender among believers a sense of having an identity separate from their duties as Chinese citizensFor many Muslims that has meant the destruction of Middle Easternstyle domes on some mosques and buildings as well as other religious motifs efforts to block some Muslims from fasting during Ramadan and a ban on minors taking religious classesXinjiang has borne the brunt of both the security and sinicization campaigns A swath of desert and mountains that abut Central Asia Xinjiang wasnt fully incorporated

antigovernment violence President Xi Jinping began a withering clampdown featuring mass detentions and political indoctrinationThat some measures are spreading to Muslim areas outside of Xinjiang shows how determined Mr Xi is to foster a broad Chinese national identity at the expense of minority cultures said Max Oidtmann a China historian at Georgetown Universitys School of Foreign Service in Qatar Those communities are largely populated by Hui Muslims an ethnic group comprised mainly of descendants of Middle Easterners Central Asians and Chinese and long considered by many officials to be a wellassimilated model minorityIn Gansus Pingliang city officials have ordered an Arabiclanguage school to shut down this month after 34 years of operations saying it hadnt received proper approval Many Muslims learn Arabic as part of their religious studies and the school had been holding classes for underprivileged studentsThe schools principal said that local officials have visited many times over the years without questioning its lack of registration A Pingliang education official said the school hasnt been compliant with regulations and declined to comment furtherIn Ningxia officially

removal of signs promoting halal food mosques were asked to stop sounding calls to prayer over loudspeakers and required to fly the Chinese national flagSome Hui Muslims chafe under the restrictions

stacked with longtime Musk allies An 11th director has been on leave since last year The additions follow the elevation in November of Robyn Denholm a veteran finance executive who joined Teslas board four years ago to replace Mr Musk as chairman which fulfilled another requirement of the regulatory settlement Mr Ellison who cofounded enterprise software giant Oracle in 1977 and is one of the bestknown executives in Silicon Valley has expressed support for Mr Musk disclosing in October that Tesla was his secondlargest personal investment Im very close friends with Elon Musk and Im a big

JournalShareholders and activist groups have long complained that Teslas board lacks the independence to properly supervise Mr Musk whose success in building the company into a major producer of electric vehicles has been matched by his ability to stir controversy with sometimes outlandish statements Critics also have pointed to Mr Musks history of making public forecasts for financial and operational performance that Tesla has failed to meetThe September settlement resolved SEC claims that Mr Musk deceived investors on Aug 7 when he tweeted that he was considering taking Tesla private

the company would struggle to raise new capital if he were ever to leave the boardThe past two years have been trying for Tesla as it tried to realize Mr Musks longpursued vision of bringing out a

the defunct investment bank wondered what to do nextThe duo now in their early 40s were part of the spin out when their business was created by Neuberger Berman the management firm in 2009The pair decided the way forward was to keep buying minority stakes in hedge funds as they had been doing at Lehman What began with a handful of people has grown to more than 30 people nowAfter being approached a few years later byProvidence Equity Partners the US private equity group that was seeking to sell a minority stake in its own management company they switched to buying noncontrolling positions in buyout groups for the first timeThe business they run Dyal Capital is the leading player in a fastexpanding field includingGoldman SachsPetershill unit and evenBlackstone which are injecting permanent capital into some of the largest names in private equityBuyout groups are known for being compulsive buyers of assets but these days they find themselves the target of this new breed of investors who are looking to acquire a share in the hefty management and performance fees they chargeThese groups are snapping up minority stakes in some of the biggest private equity groups in the world fromLeonard Green andSilver Lake in the US toBridgepoint in Europe at a time when the sector is raising its largest funds at record paceThere has been more reluctance among private equity groups in Europe but they have now seen that investors dont have a bad reaction and dont want to be disadvantagedPerson familiar with Dyals intentionsSaul Goodman head of private equity and alternatives at investment bank Evercore said 2018 saw more deals than any year prior and I see this continuing to have legs as both the investors in the funds and the managers considering it see the benefitsMr Goodman who has advised more than 25 private equity groups on selling stakes many of them to Dyal added Increasingly the market will move more towards Europe and middle market playersBased in New York Dyal is one of the largest groups in this new sector and has roughly 15bn in aggregate assets under management and about 40 stakes in hedge funds and private equity groupsIt is in now looking to expand its shopping spree in Europe and has held discussions with EQT to buy a minority stake in the largest Scandinavian private equity group which is backed by Swedens Wallenberg familyEQT is also exploring an initial public offering as part of a strategic review according to multiple people familiar with the talks EQT and Dyal declined to comment People close to the situation said talks were continuing and there was no guarantee of a dealThe group is in talks with several other European private equity groups and intends to increase the number of managers it backs in the region by the time it completes its fundraising this year people familiar with its intentions saidDyal has been speaking with European managers for some time said one of the people There has been more reluctance among private equity groups in Europe but they have now seen that investors dont have a bad reaction and dont want to be disadvantagedSean Ward and Michael Rees  company websiteLarge public pension funds in the US including the New York State Common Retirement State Fund and the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation have bought into its strategy and helped Dyal to raise more than 6bn for its latest fundSo far Dyals investments have cashed in on a vast wave of capital pouring into private equity as yieldstarved investors seek better alternatives to bonds in a lowinterest rate environmentIt has generated annualised returns of 29 per cent net of fees for its last fund this year compared to 215 per cent in 2017 said a person with direct knowledge of its performanceIts not a secret that people who own private equity groups become quite wealthy said a person with direct knowledge of Dyals investment strategy In private equity the managers do better than the investorsPeople are nervous about the worldwhats attractive about Dyal and others like them is that you get exposure to a diversified portfolioNew Yorkbased investorPrivate equity groups earn money from two main sources and investors in Dyal gain access to a share of bothThe first are the management fees of about 2 per cent that the private equity groups charge their investors in the funds they raise The second is carried interest which is usually a 20 per cent share of any profits made on investments in a fund once it exceeds a set rate of returnFor a manager who might be thinking about a public listing such as EQT selling a minority stake to a firm like Dyal might be a more attractive proposition as it brings fresh capital without the scrutiny associated with being a quoted companySelling a stake also allows buyout groups to provide financing to younger partners who do not have enough cash to invest the requisite amount in future funds a move favoured by investors who like their private equity mangers to have skin in the gameThe founders of these large funds have the cash but the 35to40yearolds dont have the money said a person familiar with the way Dyal operates Historically Blackstone KKR and others went public to deal with this But it has its downsides including not compelling valuationsHowever not everyone in private equity is convinced by the idea of selling a minority stake because of the potential conflicts it bringsThe managing director of a multibillionpound private equity group based in London who has been approached by Dyal said Managers are giving up performance fees for perpetuity and that has an impact on the ability to attract talent the person said It is also changing the incentives in that it pushes firms to be asset gatherers to benefit from a stake in management fees rather than being investorsOne quirk about Dyal is that its investments are inherently illiquid Funds Dyal raises have no time limit Its investors are charged 2 per cent on committed capital but these end after 15 years It also charges carried interest of 20 per cent on profits mirroring the way private equity groups make moneyStill investors worried about a potential market crash or being over exposed to certain buyout funds that may have overpaid for assets can still see the merits of Dyals strategy People are nervous about the worldwhats attractive about Dyal and others like them is that you get exposure to a diversified portfolio said a New Yorkbased investorWith buying a minority stake into a private equity group you get exposure to the whole offering of funds rather than just one the investor said You are exposed to everything they do

But in New York City Amazon’s plan to develop a campus in Queens is facing a lengthy conflict ahead.,https://www.wsj.com/articles/not-just-nimbyism-amazons-hq2-opponents-dig-in-for-long-fight-11546174808,2018-12-30 13:00:13,Some cities would have thrown a parade But in New York CityAmazoncom Incsplan to develop a 4millionsquarefoot office campus in Queens has run into an ongoing unionization effort local officials with their eye on the next office and progressive activists energized by recent political winsIts a stark contrast to Northern Virginia which in November was also chosen after a nationwide search to host a new office campus Amazon has promised to create at least 25000 jobs with an average salary over 150000 in both locations In New York the state and city offered up to 3 billion of incentivesA month after announcing the new sites Amazon and its opponents in New York are settling in for a lengthy conflict that rises above traditional NIMBY concerns of traffic and other impactsI definitely think theres a real opposition said Bill Cunningham a longtime political hand who worked for Michael Bloomberg from 2000 to 2005 What really is an economic development issue in terms of attracting Amazon is going to turn into first a street fight with the new activism of the Democratic Party Then it may morph into an institutional battle first at the City Council and then possibly with the state LegislatureMr Cunningham and other political consultants said the opposition has taken root in a few different ways but its too early to tell if these critics will be able to stop or change the project Its boosters Gov Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio have bypassed the New York City Councils normal land use reviews and Mr Cuomo said he wont seek legislative approval for the required fundingA poll released earlier this month found a majority of residents surveyed in Queens and New York City as a whole support the companys arrival but showed they have mixed feelings about the incentives Amazon has also hired wellconnected lobbying and public affairs firms Greenberg Traurig and SKDKnickerbockerWe are excited to work with New Yorkers over the coming months and years to bring a new Amazon headquarters to Long Island City and help support the community an Amazon spokesman said in an emailOn the political left which is dominant in the city there are both institutional players and newer grassroots resistance groups now united by a common foeOne of the first and loudest institutional opponents is the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union Its current members work in the very bricksandmortar stores that Amazon has competed so well against It now hopes to organize workers at Amazons warehouses including on Staten IslandThey would have come here anyway and its a misuse of taxpayer resources to be giving this trilliondollar company 3 billion said the unions president Stuart Appelbaum The second thing is they dont deserve the money because of how they operateHe pointed to working conditions in warehouses and resisting unionization drives Amazon has said it treats its workers fairly It also says it pays between 1750 to 23 an hour at the Staten Island warehouse and has a 15 minimum wage for all employeesMessrs Cuomo and de Blasio have touted the projects hiring impact but are sensitive to concerns from labor So are local elected officials like state Sen Mike Gianaris and New York City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer who have both headlined Amazon rallies and in the case of the latter ripped the company during a public hearing this month at City HallThe lawmakers who both represent Long Island City have also raised concerns about traffic and neighborhood gentrification Mr Cuomo said recently that he believes these issues can be addressed and Amazon along with officials has created a 45member community advisory committee Many of its members also view the project positivelyThe arrival of Amazon will revitalize neighborhood businesses and jumpstart young entrepreneurial minds in our communities Bishop Mitchell Taylor CEO of Urban Upbound said in a statement announcing his appointment to the committeeThe elected officials criticizing the Amazon deal have motivations beyond what is stated political experts said Mr Van Bramer is running for Queens borough president City Council Speaker Corey Johnson who has slammed the project for bypassing the council is keeping a lane open for a possible 2021 mayoral run Both said their opposition stems from their serious concerns over the project saying the City Council and the public were cut out of discussions They raised these concerns in the interest of their constituents they saidExperts also point to a rise in activism in the area among leftists who helped propel Repelect Alexandria OcasioCortez to an unlikely electoral victory over Joe Crowley a top Democrat in CongressNo one wants to be the next Joe Crowley said Peter Kauffmann a public affairs consultant who lives in Queens and supports the projectThis wing of the opposition is more diffuse and difficult to negotiate withbecause it doesnt want to negotiate At a recent community board meeting in Sunnyside Queens dozens of residents CUNY professors activists from community groups and political organizations spoke for hours to denounce HQ2 The most common refrain from residents and neighbors who spoke out against the plan was no Amazon no concessions  Jonathan Bailey a membership coordinator for the Queens branch of the Democratic Socialists of America has been organizing people against the project and was involved in the OcasioCortez campaignIts a much wider group of people who are opposed to Amazon coming here he said Regardless of your political ideology you dont want to be gentrified out of your homeKate Honan contributed to this articleWrite to Jimmy Vielkind at

Group",https://www.ft.com/content/73d1aae6-51e4-34b7-975e-33997dc53203,2018-12-15 11:00:04,On the fiveminute walk from the Financial Times London office to meet Nigel Kershaw I pass a young man begging a sign at his feet asking people to chip in towards the 20 he needs for a hostel bed He is just one of the 320000 people in the UK who live on the street Mr Kershaw chairman of the Big Issue Group is fighting to ease their plight The social enterprise is best known for the Big Issue magazine sold via homeless vendors on high streets nationwide Less well known is Big Issue Invest its investment arm which manages and advises on 190m Big Issue Invest extended the mission of the Big Issue to dismantle and prevent poverty Mr Kershaw says He has been at its helm since its creation in 2005 having joined the Big Issue in 1994 after a career in printing He has seen huge changes in terms of interest in socially responsible and impact investing in which Big Issue Invest specialises The areas are no longer a niche on the fringe of mainstream finance many City names are desperate to tap into it Big Issue Invest is also becoming more ambitious Last month it announced a collaboration with groups including Standard Life Aberdeen Columbia Threadneedle and AllianceBernstein to launch a blockchainpowered platform that will offer impact funds to retail investors Called the Big Exchange the fund supermarket will offer up to 40 social and environmental impact funds and aims to attract 3bn of assets within five years After 2008 people who have lived through ten years of austerity and have seen what the mainstream cant deliver are looking for more than a pure financial return says Mr Kershaw who also chairs the Big Exchange We are meeting in the caf of CitizenM a Dutch hotel chain in Southwark It is one of the capitals more deprived boroughs Mr Kershaw was born here and has lived in the area for most of his life A former socialist who has embraced capitalism as a way to achieve the Big Issues antipoverty goals he is a paradox in the financial world by his own admission The jovial 67yearold prefers to spend his days out and about nurturing ideas such as the Big Exchange fundraising and making the case for impact investing He has been pleased to see individuals who work in finance make a commitment to Big Issue ideals and says that some Big Issue Invest staff have switched from the City Theyre very driven he says The Big Issue magazine was set up in 1991 by John Bird a social entrepreneur and Gordon Roddick cofounder of the Body Shop Vendors are homeless people who buy the magazine for 125 and sell it to the public for 250 It took the notion of using business to effect change Mr Kershaw says That was not a common concept back then It was about giving people the dignity of work The idea of an investment arm was developed by Lord Bird assisted by Jon Norton a former banker who was married to Labour minister Mo Mowlam Both Mr Norton and Ms Mowlam who was Northern Ireland secretary in 199799 have since died Mr Kershaw says the Labour governments support of socially responsible investing helped foster wider interest in the concept Government was the catalyst for many of the early social investors he says The role of government is often underestimated The first product was a loan fund started with 120000 provided by HBOS the banking group bought by Lloyds Banking Group at the height of the financial crisis The fund lent to enterprises such as the trading arms of charities or companies with a socially responsible focus such as Hackney Community Transport in London which provides minibuses for local groups and people with disabilities Big Issue Invest now manages assets of 70m with a further 120m in two social impact funds the UK Social Bond Fund at Columbia Threadneedle and the UK Equity Impact Job Opportunities Fund at Standard Life Aberdeen Big Issue Invest provides an annual assessment on the social value of the projects it supports Big Issue Invests own projects include a social enterprise investment fund for large or institutional investors early stage lending programmes a fund offering unsecured lending aimed at smaller social enterprises and charities and the London Housing Fund which has 10m to finance groups providing affordable housing The Big Issue mission encouraged us to be ambitious Mr Kershaw says Although he likes to joke that people were surprised when they received money back he insists that socially responsible investing does not come at the cost of financial returns There is no sacrifice of financial returns he says The Columbia Threadneedle fund which has assets of more than 100m has posted an annualised net return of 46 per cent since 2013 Competition in impact investing is set to intensify however with increased interest from mainstream asset managers Is he concerned that some groups may launch products with a social investment tag as a marketing ploy in other words engage in social washing I think there is social washing but its a good thing As people are thinking I need to do that One of lifes optimists he jokes that the redtinted glasses he wears for medical reasons are at least rosetinted Mr Kershaw is upbeat when asked for his views on the effect on British society of a decade of austerity policies Prime minister Theresa May in her speech to the Conservative party conference in October pledged that austerity would come to an end There is scepticism over this especially given pressure on the public purse and the dark cloud cast by Brexit Theres a lot to make up The issues are around how much the fabric has fallen into disrepair but there are opportunities how you put it together again he says arguing that rebuilding social services provides a chance to create a better link between departments dealing with for instance debt and homelessness Is this desire realistic We just want to keep fighting for it He acknowledges the scale of the challenge You can look on the streets When the Big Issue was set up in 1991 you had a mass of people on the streets he says citing cardboard city near Waterloo station in London which was home for hundreds of people Youre beginning to see that go up again Shelter the homelessness charity estimates that another 13000 people have become homeless in the UK in the past year These additions mean that about one in every 200 people is now homeless Mr Kershaw sees other factors besides austerity driving this Theres a lot of pressure on younger people The nature of employment has changed he says referring to the emergence of the gig economy and zerohours contracts together with the decline of traditional manufacturing How will Britain leaving the EU affect the situation Mr Kershaw admits he has real concern over Brexit but adds We just have to deal with what we have The social entrepreneurs will rise whatever happens Theyre always setting up solutions CV Born April 21 1951 Education 197577

better at handling complex customer needs through Alexa be they home security shopping or companionshipMany of our AI dreams are inspired by science fiction said Rohit Prasad Amazons vice president and head scientist of Alexa Artificial Intelligence AI during a talk last month in Las VegasTo make that happen the company in 2016 launched the annual Alexa Prize enlisting computer science students to improve the assistants conversation skills Teams vie for the 500000 first prize by creating talking computer systems known as chatbots that allow Alexa to attempt more sophisticated discussions with peopleAmazon customers can participate by saying lets chat to their devices Alexa then tells users that one of the bots will take over unshackling the voice aides normal constraints From August

work to protect customers from offensive contentThese instances are quite rare especially given the fact that millions of customers have interacted with the socialbots Amazon saidLike Googles search

shipping industry it could be revolutionaryThe Yara Birkeland when delivered at full size will be the worlds first electric and autonomous container ship The batterypowered vessel due to start operations in 2020 would eliminate the need for 100 daily truck trips in southern Norway reducing dust and noise in the local area and eventually cutting running costs for Yara the fertiliser maker behind its creationThere is a lot of talk about electric ships but to do it is a big difference said Bjorn Tore Orvik the logistics manager at Yara behind the projectA way of disrupting one industry is by taking technologies from other industries putting them together into a new context I think this will be the new container business on shortsea shipping he addedIf any industry needed disrupting it is shipping Long known as a footdragger on climate change the container shipping sector transports fourfifths of global trade Other vast ships transport myriad commodities from oil and coal to grain and cement But such vessels are some of the dirtiest individual forms of transport in the world and shipping accounts for 2 to 3 per cent of the worlds total greenhouse gas emissionsAfter a long period of evasion and denial the industry has sputtered into life Ola Elvestuen Norways environment minister called the April announcement by the UNs shipping regulator that greenhouse gas emissions would be cut in half by 2050 as the most positive climate news this yearMaersk the worlds largest container shipping line topped that this month by telling the Financial Times that its goal was to have zero carbon emissions by 2050 We will have to abandon fossil fuels said Soren Toft Maersks chief operating officerBut not everybody in the industry buys into the idea of targets John Lyras a member of one of Greeces most prominent shipowning families told a conference last year that he was sceptical of the benefits of such targets If we really want to reduce CO2 emissions to zero today we can do it in two ways we can stop trading or we can go back to sail he said provocatively pointing to his companys logo of a sail boatAt the heart of the debate is what can replace bunker fuel A generic name for the type of fuels used on ships bunker tends to be at the cheaper and dirtier end as it comes from the residue of crude oil after other products are extractedThe International Maritime Organization has put in place a cap on sulphur levels which are extremely high in bunker fuel by 2020 while Mr Toft said that Maersk had cut its CO2 emissions per kilometre travelled by almost half in the past decadeKnown as a footdragger on climate change the container shipping sector transports fourfifths of global trade  BloombergBut to get to an absolute cut in emissions of 50 per cent by 2050 or Maersks zero target a radical change in ship design will be needed While solutions like Yaras Birkeland ship could work for short journeys Norway already has dozens of electric ferries they are not suitable for the long distances container and cargo ships have to travel often several thousand kilometres at a timeThe picture of our industry is that we are rich and dirty But the fact is that we are the most energyefficient way to transport goods already said Harald Solberg chief executive of the Norwegian Shipowners Association pointing to seaborne freights advantages over aircraft or trucks He conceded that as of today we have no solution for the long trades But he added Its very important that we as an industry move ourselves from the back to the front seat of the car and start taking responsibility for this important issueSeveral potential solutions are being examined One is to use hydrogen in fuel cells to power ships with ABB the SwissSwedish engineering group one company aiming to commercialise the technology The worlds first hydrogenpowered ferry for cars and passengers is due to enter operation in 2021 on Norways west coastWhere we Norway really are ahead is in transportation We are showing that you can have a quicker transition than could be expected said Mr Elvestuen Mr Solberg called fuel cells perhaps the most promising todayBut he and Mr Toft are clear that there is unlikely to be any silver bullet for longdistance shipping where other solutions that have been mooted include biofuels and even nuclear power as used by submarines and icebreakersWe actually believe that the result will be multiple solutions The solution we need to get towards is a fuel or propulsion mechanism that has a very highenergy density which makes it different to cars said Mr ToftHe expects new innovations and new partners to play a role as well Its important that we dont think theres a silver bullet out there that will solve the issue I dont want to rule anything out Its very easy to say sails for container ships doesnt make sense because youre loading and unloading thousands of containers he said adding that the industry had achieved efficiency gains in the past decade that would have been unthinkable at the turn of the centuryAlthough 2050 might appear a long way off there is a real sense of urgency The average life of a ship is about 20 years meaning that the new design of boats needs to be in place by around 2030Mr Toft said that the hardest part would be to get everybody in the supply chain to work with equal intensity But he added that environmental impact was rising up the list of concerns for Maersks customers We cant wait to get all the ducks lined up he saidClimate change is certainly a threat to the way the shipping industry has operated in recent decades but Mr Solberg is keen to see it as more than that Climate change is one of the biggest concerns for us Its obviously a challenge but we also see it as a big opportunity for us as an industry and we have to invest in this opportunity he addedEmbed video

yachts around the world Yet 10 years ago this was an industry I didnt even know existedThose wealthy enough to own a yacht are unlikely to have as much time as they would like to sail it So theyre happy to engage a professional delivery crew to get their boat where it needs to beMany of my regular customers are tycoons from the worlds of aviation shipping pharmaceuticals and oil prepared to entrust my crew with their pride and joy Some of them love sailing so much they have even asked if they can come along as a crew member on our other deliveries Other customers lack the experience for long offshore or ocean passages and many of our deliveries are for brokers delivering brand new yachts from the factory to buyers around the worldSo how did I get here Sailing is in my blood Starting with dinghies at school and Scouts and sailing on my dads Sadler 25 I am at my happiest when afloat Nevertheless my career for 30 years was firmly on land working as a chartered surveyor mostly for Land Securities where I latterly managed a 700m property fundIn 2009 I left the corporate world I was in my fifties and looking for a new adventure Almost by accident I found an advert on Facebook A professional yacht delivery company was looking for a crew member to take a new 45ft Jeanneau from the south of France to Istanbul After a quick exchange of emails I was on a flight the next day to Beziers to meet the crewWith a professional skipper at the helm we headed into the Gulf of Lion well known among sailors as because it roars Wind speeds of 40 knots are to be expected as the Mistral barrels down the PyreneesWe soon settled into our routine of three hours on watch and six hours off After two days sail our first stop was Bonifacio in Corsica the most beautiful natural harbour with an entrance dominated by a castle complete with a chain that can be pulled across to prevent ships entering Having refuelled our next stop was Salina one of the Aeolian Islands to the north of Sicily We tied up on the fishermens quay and settled into a lovely restaurant overlooking Stromboli island with its active volcano The boat is always dry but the gins in that restaurant were outstandingSail away After that trip my heart was set on becoming a commercial skipper As skipper you are managing a project to deliver a yacht in as good or better condition at handover You are responsible for managing people navigation fuel and food The business model for yacht delivery means that usually only the skipper gets paid The crew do it for the love of sailing and to build miles but travel expenses and meals are covered This is how I started off The biggest reward is the people you meet Sailing on boats you get to meet the most amazing characters both owners and crewSome crew are young people hoping for a career in sailing building miles for their qualifications Many are retired One group I really like are exforces Two of my regular crew Brian Seage and Nigel Langorn were formerly senior officers in Royal Marines and Royal Navy They have seen active service and tell some super stories when were at sea but have an attitude focusing on getting the job done They understand the chain of command and thankfully for me are happy taking orders from a civilian skipperAfter a few years I sat and passed my RYA MCA Yachtmaster exam this was an eighthour ordeal but it is a highly respected qualification recognised worldwide Having qualified one itch I wanted to scratch was crossing the Atlantic So when I was offered first refusal on a delivery from the British Virgin Islands to Falmouth in Cornwall I did not hesitate Next stop Gatwick flying out to Antigua at someone elses expense then on to Tortola Sitting on a beach where coconuts grow felt a world away from visiting shopping centres in Leeds in my days with Land SecuritiesAfter sailing 700 miles to Bermuda it was over to La Corua in Spain and after a few days the final push up to Falmouth Then 10 metres off the mooring buoy a UK Border Control team boarded our Rustler 42 yacht and literally took it apart Any boat coming out of the Caribbean is a target for cocaine smugglers Fortunately we were free to go after a delay of several hoursFor me the night watches are just amazing Away from land you see the stars and the Milky Way in a way that is impossible to describe The wildlife is enthralling To see dolphins herding tuna into a tighter and tighter ball is incredible Ive frequently seen whales sharks turtles sunfish weighing up to 1000kg and flying fish Bioluminescence at night is stunning The boat disturbs small organisms which emit light a bit like diamonds sparkling in the wake of the boat I never tire of watching gannets fishing they drop like a stone from 100ft Once we had a cormorant join us over Biscay They are shallow water fishers so the poor chap was quite literally out of his depth He had to hitch a ride home with us Choppy watersLife as a commercial skipper is not always plain sailing The first rule of running out of diesel is dont One day I did just as we were passing Lands End We sailed on to a mooring buoy at Penzance At 2am the bay was filled with fishing boats waiting for the tide to go into Newlynn A call on the VHF radio secured the offer of a 20litre can of diesel Out of the darkness with dazzling deck lights a massive oceangoing trawler from Troon threw a heaving line and passed the can The skipper would not accept payment but we popped down to Newlynn the next day with a big bottle of whisky for him Seafarers have a respect for the sea and helping someone in need is part of thatSailing is often seen as a male activity but some of the best crew I sail with are women Recent female crew members have included a soldier and a trauma surgeon from Munich They were terrific sailors and gender was simply not an issue Hard as nails female sailors can match any man in adverse weatherStormy weather generally produces great seafaring stories but its the little experiences that are often the most profound Seeing shooting stars as you pass Africa watching dolphins playing with the bow wave and Ill never forget the day I almost sailed over a sperm whale Equally walking into a small grocers shop in Sicily to be greeted with prego makes you realise you are in a different land When you pass Trafalgar youll see it exactly as Nelson didTechnology means you can navigate the Seven Seas armed with an iPad Nevertheless you have to prove you can do it the oldfashioned way too Much of the training to become a yachtmaster is to prepare you for things going wrong and knowing when to call for helpLast year one of my adventures involved about a dozen unrelated problems all coming together Delivering a new yacht from Southampton to Greenock the engine started spluttering in worsening weather The autohelm the yachting equivalent of an autopilot mechanism had failed and a crew member had been taken ill Then a second crew member suddenly developed severe chest pain After passing the Eddystone Lighthouse in Cornwall we diverted to Fowey and I dialled 999 so an ambulance would be ready to meet us when we tied up In building seas and failing light I had to find the entrance to the Fowey river among the towering cliffs with waves breaking up the cliff face This is where your training kicks in but it was very lonely experience staying calm at the helm and prioritising tasksRecommendedIt turned out to be only angina but for both crew it was the end of their trip By chance my regular crewman Brian was available a short hop away in Falmouth As we headed up the Irish Sea to Greenock still with no autohelm my lasting memory was Brian pointing the forestay at the north star reciting the John Masefield poem Sea Fever All I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her byReflecting on the 12 deliveries Ive made this year what motivates me is sailing with a purpose meeting new people in new places and enjoying their storiesIn March this year I delivered a thoroughbred racing boat from Cowes in the Isle of Wight to Mallorca We decided to have a final dinner in the Royal Yacht Club in Palma where we swapped sea stories with three Swiss nationals on the next table A selection of liqueurs arrived and the conversation flowed At the end of the night our new Swiss friends picked up the tab insisting that people had been kind to them at sea and they wanted to pass on the kindnessMy advice to anyone thinking about taking the same change in career direction as me is just get on with it Becoming a commercial skipper is very different from racing around at your local sailing club but a modicum of offshore experience and some qualifications could get you aboard as crewI say to my friends that there is no better feeling than stepping ashore with your skin slightly tight with the sun some salt in your hair a drink in your hand and the sound of good music ashore as you set off to trade tales of your adventures If there is a heaven it must look a lot like Tarbert Loch Fyne in the sunshineDavid Smith is a professional yacht skipper with Halcyon Yachts International Yacht Delivery To read more stories like this visit Next Act the

had delivered the package to a different town Best Buy apologized and offered to reship it But Zimmermann who works in marketing in Chicago was over itI just want a refund she told the retailer and then added At this point I have already ordered from Amazon because I know for a fact it will be here when they say it willAmazon is far and away the leader in ecommerce outpacing competitors like Walmart Target and eBay But its dominance is never more pronounced than in the nailbiter lastminute sprint before ChristmasThe company based in Seattle has had a twodecadelong obsession with shrinking the time from click to doorstep It has built warehouses in more than 30 states and a sophisticated web of delivery methods giving it a logistical advantageAmazon has used that edge to lead people to expect near instant gratification that for a while only it could deliver The company built trust in its delivery speed with its Prime membership which costs US119 a year and includes twoday shipping This year in the days leading up to Christmas Amazons share of online sales will increase by almost 50 per cent  to about half of all digital sales  while most rivals fade according to the market research firm Rakuten IntelligenceAmazons ability to fulfill more quickly and effectively than competitors has been a key differentiator back to the earliest days said Kenneth Cassar an analyst with Rakuten Intelligence which is an independent subsidiary of the Japanese eretailer RakutenTraditional retailers still enjoy strong sales when the holiday season begins around American Thanksgiving They advertise widely luring shoppers with doorbuster deals The promotions also drive sales to their websites instead of Amazon Around Thanksgiving Amazons share of online sales can dip to as low as 20 percent in the United States according to RakutenBut as November turns to December and then into Christmas crunchtime shoppers preferences change Last year Walmart and Target had their busiest online traffic of the month on Dec 10 Amazons was eight days later on Dec 18 according to an analysis by Griffin Carlborg a researcher at the digital intelligence firm Gartner L2Amazon has just built up its reputation around rapid fulfillment incredibly well Carlborg said Customers really trust Amazons fulfillment offeringsThose shoppers include Carissa Vinovskis 26 who puts in 12hour days researching diabetes at Childrens Hospital Colorado She used to shop for Christmas gifts in stores but as she got busy with graduate school and later her job she had less time and patiencePanic set in fast in the middle of this month when Vinovskis realized she had just six days to get presents before visiting her parents She found a few cute things on Etsy  beautiful handcrafted gifts she said  and then realized they would take about four weeks to arriveI was like welp Amazon Prime it is she saidAn Amazon spokeswoman pointed to a statement in which the vice president who runs Prime Cem Sibay said We keep working to add faster and even more convenient delivery optionsAmazons speedy delivery has been a key focus In 2000 it invested US60 million in Kozmo a New York startup that delivered snacks movies and other goods in less than an hour About a year later Kozmo shut down But it remained an inspiration to Jeff Bezos Amazons founder and chief executive according to a former Amazon employee who heard him discuss the matterBezos saw that quick delivery could change how people buy things Price and selection have always been important in retailing but delivery would surpass store location as another critical factorIn 2005 Amazon began offering free twoday shipping for Prime members which Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates covers more than twothirds of US households Almost a decade later it started Prime Now which delivers goods in as little as an hour in 30 citiesAmazon now has over 110 fulfillment centres in North America more than 250000 warehouse employees and dozens of its own planes It is setting up warehouses that hold tens of millions of items closer to major cities letting it offer free sameday and oneday shipping on more productsWalmart and others

traditional retailers are leveraging their physical stores  a key advantage they have over Amazon  and providing ways for people to order online and pick up in person That is particularly powerful in the final days before Christmas when shoppers return to storesThe biggest area that were playing offence right now is with our stores Marc Lore who runs Walmarts US ecommerce business told investors in OctoberFor some Walmart purchases customers dont need to leave their car to get their order  an employee will drop it into their trunk Best Buy said more than 40 per cent of its online revenue is from orders that are now picked up in stores And on Christmas Eve people can order products online from store inventory as late as 5 pm and pick them up just an hour laterMarshal Cohen who advises retailers for the NPD Group a market research firm said three years ago retailers rushed to match Amazon offering free twoday shipping until just before Christmas  but didnt have their delivery partners sufficiently prepared for the rushThey just clogged the system so badly and really disappointed a lot of consumers Cohen said That memory was pretty strong in a lot of consumers minds when it comes to thinking about shopping onlineBuilding the technology and infrastructure to quickly and consistently fill orders is not cheap and after years of breakneck expansion Amazon has squeezed more productivity out of its investments It picks packs and mails items out of its warehouses in a day or less and packages arrive at a customers doorstep about two days later according Rakuten data The data was based on electronic receipts and shipping notifications retailers sent to more than 5 million users who use Rakutens consumer appsAmazon is faster than every major competitor though other retailers are speeding up In 2016 Old Navy which is owned by Gap took about 10 days to deliver a package ordered during the week after Thanksgiving Rakuten data shows This year its packages showed up about three days faster Walmart cut its delivery time from more than a week to six days over the same period And Best Buy said 80 per cent of its small packages now arrive in two days or underYet most retailers still have to work to win peoples trust Jessica Palazzo who runs afterschool programs near Hartford Connecticut bought her mother pajamas from Old Navy two years ago that were guaranteed to arrive before Christmas but which didnt appear until January Old Navy offered her 10 per cent off her next orderThis year on Black Friday she put a pair of Gap pyjamas into her online shopping cart  but then had a change of heartThats embarrassing if you come on Christmas and have nothing for somebody Palazzo said She ended up buying running socks and a running ear warmer for her mother from

increase,https://www.ft.com/content/565f36a6-0302-11e9-99df-6183d3002ee1,2018-12-19 05:01:21,Jay Powell will today wrap up the thorniest policy meeting of his chairmanship as the Federal Reserve faces a barrage of calls for easy money as the stock market slides in anticipation of soggy global economic growthAmericas top central banker will face the media at 230pm US eastern time a halfhour after the Fed announces its latest rates decision President Donald Trump renewed his demands for unchanged rates in advance of the meeting as did some investors bruised by the recent declines on the stock marketHowever Fed officials have signalled they will boost rates by a quarter point at the meeting and holding fire would look skittish according to analysts and strategists It would send a markedly downbeat signal about the economic outlook it might indicate the Fed is overly influenced by market turbulence and it would trigger claims that the president is influencing policyThe Fed doesnt like surprising the market said Ralph Axel an interest rate strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch It would be more disruptive for the Fed to not hike than to hikeAssuming the central bank pulls the trigger on a rate increase Mr Powell faces a delicate balancing act as he attempts to convey an upbeat assessment of US growth while acknowledging the fears that have roiled financial markets in recent weeksThose hazards dubbed downside risks in central banker parlance include signs of a sharp slowdown in European and Asian growth induced in part by Mr Trumps trade warsIn addition the Fed is weighing up the chances of a marketjolting hard Brexit in the UK evidence of a slowdown in US sectors that are sensitive to past rate rises such as housing and the prospect of waning fiscal stimulus from the second half of next yearMarkets are still pricing in an increase in interest rates when the Fed puts out its monetary policy announcement today It will mark the fourth move of 2018 putting the Feds target range at 22525 per centBut rates predictions have been curtailed somewhat in recent days More dramatic has been the fall in market expectations for next year Back in November fed funds futures were pointing to two quarterpoint rate increases next year but that measure now implies a strong chance of no move at all in 2019 with only a possibility of a single increaseWeaker economic data overseas including contraction in Germany and Japan in the third quarter and a marked slowing in China have contributed to angst on the stock market While the domestic US economy still looks solid as the unemployment rate hovers at just 37 per cent recent days have produced a chorus of complaints from both the president and Wall Street over the Feds tightening policiesOn social media Mr Trump said on Tuesday that Fed officials should read a Wall Street Journal editorial calling for a pause on rates before they make yet another mistake He added Feel the market dont just go by meaningless numbersStanley Druckenmiller a prominent investor who runs Duquesne Family Office said on Bloomberg television there were amber signals on the economy and that officials needed to pay attention to equity market fallsTo the Feds critics lifting rates further while reducing its balance sheet will squeeze growth when the economy is already at risk of slowing Recent declines in equity markets are adding to the pressure on the economy Goldman Sachs analysts say if the recent tightening in financial conditions remains unchanged it would shave between threequarters and one percentage point off growth next yearDefying expectations and holding rates unchanged today would carry its own hazards however It could be portrayed as capitulation to Wall Street and to a president who has disregarded White House precedent with a steady stream of public advice and admonitions to the central bank It may also be taken by traders as affirmation of their worst fears about the slowing global outlook at a time when the central bank needs to offer a reassuring handMr Powell has recently struggled to offer a steady lead on Fed policy In early October he gave an exuberant assessment of Americas economic outlook and appeared to suggest multiple rate increases lay aheadYet he amended that message in a November speech that sent rollercoaster stock markets surging again as he indicated the central bank would not need to lift rates far to get them into the neutral range of estimates levels that neither boost the economy nor hold it backUncertainty will probably grow in the new year since the Fed is preparing to withdraw its guidance telling markets to expect further gradual rate increases The central bank wants instead to keep its options open about what to do next with rates as

in its stores to accommodate Amazon delivery and pickup from online orders The buildout would also intensify competition among grocers that are already fighting to retain customers Supermarkets have

facility as the American aviation company tries to cater to its top export market while steering clear of the tensions battering USChina relations At what Boeing calls its completion and deliver center here on an island south of Shanghai the first finished jet a 737 MAX rolled off the production line Saturday ready for delivery to Air China Ltd Though a Boeing billboard for the facility at the local airport proclaims the future is built here the center doesnt actually build planes Rather it paints and fits the interiors of jets flown in from Boeings factory in Renton WA ahead of their delivery to Chinese airlines The facility and its limited remit illustrate the tightrope Boeing is walking as Washington and Beijing spar over trade including the transfer of technology Boeings walking a fine line said Scott Kennedy an expert on Chinas industrial policies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies a Washington think tank Boeing he said must court China to safeguard its market position without risking a backlash at home where manufacturers are under pressure to build more in America and less in China The USChina trade dispute could put Boeings lucrative

Saturday ahead of the centers opening ceremony That is especially so given the challenging time were going through he said referring to USChina relations After threatening and then imposing tariffs on goods that cover about 60 of their trade the US and China declared a 90day truce this month to create room for negotiations Even if the two sides manage to put punitive tariffs in abeyance harder to resolve will be many of the Chinese trade practices the US says are unfair including the coercive transfer of technology Chinas leadership has set its sights on retooling the countrys manufacturing base to dominate industries of the future including aviation While officials are considering shelving the centerpiece strategy for that effort known as Made in China 2025 as a concession many powerful bureaucracies and state companies believe that such an upgrade is critical if China is to become a superpower As the biggest US exporter of all Boeings dependence on China makes it an obvious target in a trade war One of every four planes Boeing delivers goes to a Chinese carrier Over the next two decades the company expects China to buy one in six of all jetliners sold globallysome 119 trillion in Chinese orders Boeing expects to split with European rival Airbus SE While Airbus would like to enlarge its share at Boeings expense both companies are struggling to clear yearslong backlogs of orders As a result China cant hammer Boeing without disrupting its own fastgrowing aviation sector Tellingly a 5 tariff China slapped on US aircraft in September exempted Boeings large jets Boeing is not immune to the trade war but its at the bottom of the list of targets CSISs Mr Kennedy said In the longer term Chinas plan to develop its own jetlinersa key plank of Made in China 2025is a risk Chinas homegrown C919 a rival to the 737 is still in testing but deliveries to stateowned Chinese airlines should start by around 2021 And aviation companies are under pressure to help Chinas budding aviation sector by providing technology and knowhow in exchange for market access Airbus has responded by operating an actual production line that builds A320 jets in the northeast city of Tianjin It is increasing production there to six aircraft a month from around four currently It also has a local finishing center similar to Boeings for widebody aircraft Boeings new Zhoushan facility is meant to show the company deserves its marketleading position in China Mr Bruns said Boeing contributes around 1 billion a year to the Chinese economy by sourcing jetliner parts here and through training programs Even so Boeing still builds exclusively in the US and has no plans to change that Mr Bruns said While painting and fitting 737s in China frees up capacity in the US he said it is more efficient to assemble the jets in a single US location Richard Aboulafia a vice president at Teal Group a US aviation intelligence company said Boeing is doing a good balancing act in China Moving local production to China hasnt enabled Airbus to eclipse Boeing he said A domestic China line doesnt get you very much other than risking the transmission of valuable technology Write to Trefor Moss

composition of the publicequity markets Alissa Amico who runs the Parisbased corporategovernance advisory firm Govern told me Because tech companies are so prominent as the largest listed companies in terms of market cap we should also be thinking about what we require of themThe highestprofile tech firms represent about onefifth of the SampP 500s 225 trillion market capitalization according to Thomson Reuters data Of course small groups of companies have always held disproportionate sway in the market but yesterdays behemoths were a more diversified bunch than the group commonly dubbed FAANG Facebook IncAmazoncom IncApple IncNetflix Inc and Google parentAlphabet IncMs Amico a former executive at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development recently published Dinosaur Governance in the Era of Unicorns suggesting among other things that tech companies need time limits on complex dualclass share structures that create separate tiers of stockholders at firms such as Alphabet and Facebook and often insulate founders from accountabilityShe also proposed that boards create technology committees populated by experts to close the knowledge gap that can makes it hard for directors to effectively supervise techsavvy founders To further restrict founders influence she said more CSuite managers should report to the board and the chairman and CEO roles should be kept separateAmy Westbrook a professor at the Washburn University School of Law in Topeka Kan who has studied unicorns agreed that traditional methods of regulating capital markets and corporate governance are several steps behind In the case of controversial dualclass or nonvoting stock structures states stock exchanges indexes or the Securities and Exchange Commission could mandate change but she said she fears those agencies have conflicts or lack the political willSetting an end date for how long a company can offer multiple tiers of stock may have a chance at succeeding given the recent backlash against dualclass regimes she saidSnap IncBlue Apron Group and a host of other startups installed such plans at the time of their IPOs Ms Westbrook said that we place too much trust in the founders of tech companies and the big funds that invest in them but there is a lack of empirical evidence to show that more rules are an effective salve when that trust is misplaced Gender quotas on boards for instance dont necessarily lead to a more diverse workforce Directors in the banking sector are held to more rigid and complex standards than peers in other industries but that didnt prevent the financial meltdown a decade agoGovernance structures Ms Westbrook said this week are hardly a guarantee Still there is a growing body of evidence suggesting tech founders need better guidancea job that often falls to the board of directorsFor instance Elon Musk was forced by the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year to relinquish the chairman role atTesla IncHe now faces questions over how the resources of SpaceX which he founded were used to fund the separate Boring Co tunneldigging venture that he created two years agoOne of the dominant storylines over the past year has been the series of missteps committed by Facebook Inc founder Mark Zuckerberg and his management team The company has been promiscuous with the personal data it collects and its social network has proven to be vulnerable to political manipulationDo these billionaires simply need better board oversight or should they have broad latitude to make mistakesDonald Graham the former CEO of Washington Post Co and a former Facebook director said this week that being on the board of a founderled entity isnt a job where members tell executives what to do At an ordinary public company the board is the boss Mr Graham said referring to companies where a professional CEO is installed Board members at a place like Facebook play more of an advisory roleIf someone owns a great deal or a majority of a stock in a company then I think shareholders looking at that company need to determine whether to trust the person making the decisions Mr Graham said Three years after leaving the board he is confident in Mr Zuckerberg because he installed strong directors on Facebooks board including Netflix Inc founder Reed Hastings and venture capitalist Peter Thiel But that faith wasnt automatic Earlier in his career Mr Zuckerberg orchestrated the 1 billion acquisition of the Instagram photosharing network without first consulting the board which Mr Graham was on While he thought Mr Zuckerbergs communication strategy with the board was a mistake the purchase turned out to be a win for the companyMs Amico the adviser agrees that we need to recognize these companies would not have emerged to be what they are today if not for unruly genius CEOs But even the smartest person in the room needs someone to stop them from doing something dumbWrite to John D Stoll at johnstollwsjcom

despite headwinds,https://www.ft.com/content/eb63d186-0e5f-11e9-acdc-4d9976f1533b,2019-01-02 11:27:20,Last year the US was exceptional in many ways A large fiscal expansion accelerated growth while the world was slowing Core inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index climbed up to the Federal Reserves 2 per cent target for the first time in more than six years but remained stuck far below target in Europe and JapanAs a consequence the Federal Reserve confidently raised interest rates every quarter and shrank its balance sheet while the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan continued to conduct quantitative easing With tax cuts boosting profits US stocks outperformed most others and wider growth and interest rate differentials propelled the dollar higher with adverse consequences for emerging marketsThis year however US exceptionalism looks set to fade on several fronts For starters the growth gap between the US and the rest should narrow significantlyOne reason is that US financial conditions have tightened significantly in recent months as the Fed continued to raise rates credit spreads widened the dollar appreciated and equities tanked While the recent drop in bond yields could be seen as offsetting some of the tightening it has also flattened the yield curve further which is hardly encouragingAnother reason to expect an ebbing of US growth momentum relative to the rest of the world is that fiscal stimulus will be fading in the course of this year and additional tax cuts or spending increases look unlikely in the new political constellation following the midterm elections Meanwhile more fiscal easing will be forthcoming in China and Japan as well as in several European countries including France and Italy in response to slower growth and populist pressuresMoreover the plunge in oil prices since early October benefits the Chinese European and Japanese economies more than the US economy as the former are large net energy importers whereas the US nowadays produces about as much energy as it consumes Thus what US consumers gain from lower energy prices is roughly matched by losses for domestic producers Also as the example of the previous sharp drop in oil prices in 201415 demonstrated producers may cut investment faster than consumers spend their windfall gains so that the nearterm net impact of lower oil prices on the US economy could in fact be negativeWith growth slowing inflation still tame markets more volatile and interest rates reaching neutral territory the Federal Reserve looks likely to pause or even end its tightening campaign sooner rather than later this year Whether this happens already at the current level of the fed funds rate which is what the money market forwards are currently pricing in or after one or two more rate hikes will depend on economic data and financial market developmentsIn any case Jay Powell and his colleagues will be facing a formidable communication challenge whenever they decide to signal a pause To see why recall Ben Bernankes experience soon after becoming Fed chair in early 2006 When he first mentioned that the Fed might pause its rate hike cycle at some point in the future markets immediately jumped to the conclusion that the Fed was done tightening and would start easing soon When media then reported a few days later that he felt misinterpreted markets corrected sharply Eventually the Fed didnt pause but ended the rate hike cycle after two more increasesYet whether how and when to pause or end the rate hike cycle is not the only tricky decision Jay Powell and colleagues will be facing this year The Committee will also have to decide on how to technically operate monetary policy in the future which will determine the level of excess reserves required to run the system smoothly If the Fed decides to stick to the current floor system as seems likely rather than return to the precrisis system balance sheet shrinkage and thus quantitative tightening could come to an end in the second half of this yearWill the fading of US growth and monetary policy exceptionalism spell the end of US equity outperformance and of the dollar rally Not necessarily US companies remain more profitable and cyclically sensitive stocks account for a smaller share of the overall market than in many other markets Also a pause in the Feds rate hike cycle and a potential end of quantitative tightening should help relative US equity performance Meanwhile a dollar reversal at some stage this year is entirely conceivable but it requires two triggers a trade deal between the US and China and a clear signal from the Fed that the end of the tightening cycle is nearIf so the end of US exceptionalism would be good news for risk markets and for President TrumpThe author is a managing director and global economic adviser at Pimco

Financial Services CommitteeMs Waters has spent more than three decades as a politician representing the Los Angeles area in the California Assembly and since 1990 the US House She has been one of the most aggressive Democratic critics of President TrumpShe has said she would make housing finance a priority The committee also faces thorny debates over banking for marijuana businesses financial technology and government insurance for floods and terrorist attacks Ms Waters also is likely to probe big banks and the Trump administration including the Treasury Department and other agencies her committee overseesShe has previously suggested thatWells Fargoamp Co should be broken up for repeated consumer abuses and demanded information onDeutsche Bank AGsloans to Mr Trump But she didnt then wield the subpoena authority that comes with the chairmans gavelOn the regulatory front a likely target is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Democrats helped create the agency in 2010 and argue

roll back bank rules and generally avoided publicly grilling Wall Street executives Ms Waters is expected to change tack on all countsShe also could shift gears on oversight of the Federal Reserve She is less likely than Republicans to seek limits on the Feds discretion in steering the economy and more likely to focus on other issues such as the Feds bigbank rules and how Fed policies affect

of House Democratic leaders Ms Lowey would take the lead writing the spending bills needed to fund the government Congressional leaders typically strike an agreement on the overall funding level but leave it to the appropriations panel to divvy up the money between agenciesShe is expected to write bills that will be dramatically different from those drafted by the committees previous chairman Rep Rodney Frelinghuysen R NJ who retired Ms Lowey has championed womens reproductive rights and teenpregnancy prevention and wont seek to block Planned Parenthood from receiving federal funding as House Republicans have soughtShe has also advocated for gun control and would seek new funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to research gun violence Under Ms Lowey Democrats on the

taking over the Foreign Affairs Committee Mr Engel 71 is a veteran of Congress since 1989 representing parts of the Bronx and Westchester CountyThe House Foreign Affairs Committee is typically less partisan than most panels given its focus on such foreign policy issues as human rights democracy promotion and the impact of US decisions around the globe But under Democratic leadership there are likely to be questions about topics including the Trump administrations management of the State Department and diplomatic decisions concerning Iran North Korea and IsraelThe outgoing chairman Rep Ed Royce of California is retiring from Congress after reaching a term limit for his leadership of the panel From the perch he had been a harsh critic of the Obama administration In the Trump years he

also been a champion of Democratic positions Earlier this year he opposed a Trump administration proposalwhich ultimately was droppedto use Pentagon funds to start construction of the border wallThe next few years are seen as critical for the committee The Pentagons budget now free of budget caps is expected to level off after next year posing a challenge to efforts to fund improvements in military readinessequipment and force strengthas well as modernization and procurement efforts needed to counter a rising China and a more aggressive RussiaDuring his tenure Mr Thornberry had focused

anywhere in the federal government Democrats are expected to look into Mr Trumps possible business conflicts of interest personnel decisions within the administration spending decisions guilty pleas by Trump confidants and many other issues that should make the oversight panel one of the busiestThe previous chairman was Republican Rep Trey Gowdy of South Carolina who has retired from Congress He believed in a very narrow mandate for the job keeping the panel focused on such issues as the census postal reform and streamlining government programs Mr Gowdys approach drew criticism from Democrats who said Congress had abdicated its responsibility to conduct aggressive oversight of Mr Trump and his subordinatesByron TauTransportation and Infrastructure Committee Rep Peter DeFazio of Oregon previously the committees ranking Democrat has become chairman Mr DeFazio represents coastal counties south of Portland to the California border A former congressional aide he served as a county commissioner before being elected to Congress in 1986During his time in the Democratic minority Mr DeFazio had expressed a willingness to work with the Trump administration He was among the Democrats who initially applauded Mr Trumps talk of a major federal infrastructurerebuilding effort only to denounce the administrations eventual proposal which would have relied on local governments to raise the majority of the money Mr DeFazio labeled that idea a scamMr DeFazio succeeds Rep Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania who has retired from Congress Mr Shuster was able to win committee support and backing from Mr Trump for a plan to privatize the countrys airtrafficcontrol system but was thwarted by opposition in the Senate A fiveyear reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration that passed both chambers left out Mr Shusters privatization proposal Mr DeFazio likewise opposed the privatization planMr DeFazio will also likely take a tougher line on commuter and freight railroads that have

after Congress extended the deadline to the end of 2018Ted MannCommittee on Agriculture Rep Collin Peterson a Minnesota Democrat who served as the Agriculture Committees chairman from 2007 through

rural agricultural district that President Trump won by more than 30 percentage points in 2016 His district is so large that he often travels around it in a singleengine planeMr Peterson is known for taking a bipartisan approach to farm legislationas well as to some of his hobbies He has played guitar in several rock bands with lawmakers from both parties including one called The Second AmendmentsMr Peterson last year opposed a measure drafted by the committees Republican leadership that would have tightened work requirements for those receiving food stamps While that measure passed

is also expected to pay special attention to the commodities biggest in his district including sugar beets and dairy as well as animal healthKristina PetersonCommittee on Homeland Security Rep Bennie Thompson is a senior Democrat from Mississippi who has been a member of the committee since its origins 16 years ago in the wake of the Sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks When Democrats took control of the House in 2006 Mr Thompson served as its chairman and he will move to resume the roleAlthough the Homeland Security Committee has historically worked in a bipartisan fashion there was some tension between Mr Thompson and the previous chairman Texas Republican Rep Michael McCaulMr Thompson has criticized Mr McCaul for not spending enough committee time on election security and the integrity of US elections a topic Mr Thompson is expected to focus on when he resumes the chairmanship Another oversight priority for Mr Thompson is likely to be the Trump administrations immigration policy along

of the party and has served in Congress for more than a decadeMr Grijalva will take steps to enhance environmental protections and restrictions on the use of federal land which former Republican

stepped down as secretaryAndrew DuehrenBudget Committee Rep John Yarmuth of Kentucky the panels top Democrat becomes its next chairman A former Senate aide Mr Yarmuth also worked for years in the media writing columns for a Louisville weekly newspaper he founded and debating politics on televisionCurrently the only Democrat in the Kentucky congressional delegation Mr Yarmuth generally sides with Democratic Party leaders but has said he can be more skeptical when it comes to federal regulationsMr Yarmuth has used his position as the top Democrat on the Budget Committee to challenge years of Republican budget blueprints seeking to reduce federal spending particularly through cuts to safetynet programs such as Medicare He has said that when he takes the panels helm he will hold a hearing on Medicare for All a singlepayer system in which the government not insurance companies typically pays healthcare providers for treating patientsOne of the biggest hurdles facing the Budget Committee will be the expiration in September of the twoyear budget deal struck in February 2018 between President Trump and congressional leaders Since imposing spending caps in 2011 lawmakers have reached agreements to lift spending above those limits But Republicans have pushed for larger increases in defense spending while Democrats have said nonmilitary spending should get a comparable boostKristina PetersonCommittee on Education and Labor Rep Bobby Scott the first AfricanAmerican to serve in the Houses Virginia delegation since Reconstruction is taking the helm of the Education and Labor CommitteeAn advocate for increased student and worker protections Mr Scott is likely to take up a reauthorization of the law governing higher education A draft bill released by committee Democrats last July shows they would likely concentrate on college affordability in part by making federal financial aid more generous and cracking down on forprofit colleges using unethical recruiting practices that leave students with longterm debt they cant pay back One area the bill is unlikely to touch free college an idea popular with the left that many Democratic policy makers say is unworkableMr Scott who opposed the nomination of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is also likely to call her in for more committee hearings on issues ranging from guns in schools to civilrights protections and the secretarys agenda to deregulate the forprofit college industryMr Scott has also expressed interest in several hotbutton labor issues including raising the minimum wage to 15 an hour and pushing for mandatory paid family leave His committee has introduced legislation that would increase laborunion protections after a Supreme Court decision in June gutted a pillar of publicsector union strengthThe newly Democratic committees first order of business a name change It will now be titled the Committee on Education and Labor instead of the Committee on Education and

investment officer of Equiton Inc predicts One in the first half of the year when he expects a conclusion to the USChina trade war and another in the second half when the analyst community relearns how to track the company Apple has lost more than US250 billion in market cap since the beginning of November  with shares plunging more than 29 per cent to close Friday at US15623  as analysts responded to its decision to no longer disclose iPhone sales numbers by lowering target prices across the board In Placidis view analyst comfort levels changed because they no longer had the same tools at their disposal and will have to learn to draw their conclusions in another way Headlines suggesting Apple may have to move iPhone production out of China because of heavy tariffs are only adding to the sour sentiment he said None of that deters his belief that a rally is on the way Theres nobody really sitting next to them thats going to be able to unseat them he saidJoel Clark KJ InvestmentsThe Stock Enbridge Inc TSXENBJoel Clark CEO and portfolio manager of KJ Investments says the economy is weakening and with interest rates rolling over too hes playing defence Enbridge Inc is a good choice for investors who want to transition their portfolios toward a defensive mindset he said because its a utility stock which are known for outperforming most other sectors when markets slow Enbridge also has a near seven per cent dividend yield having announced in December that it would be boosting it to 295 per share annually Closing at 4216 on Friday the stock is down about 16 per

ManagementThe Stock Alimentation CoucheTard Inc TSXATDBFor the past couple of years Picton Mahoney Asset Management portfolio manager Michael White has been telling investors to steer clear of

aggressive MampA strategy Whites concerns dissipated this year While the companys stock underperformed between March and July trading between 52 and 55 it took off in late October and is now trading above 6785 Positive change often begets positive share price momentum White said That inflection came with a sharp reversal in samestores sales and organic sales growth on the heels of the acquisitions and successful integrations of CST Brands and Holiday Convenience stores also function as a defensive choice for investors when markets are struggling White saidAmar Pandya PenderFund Capital ManagementThe Stock Maxar Technologies Ltd TSXMAXRMaxar Technologies Ltd was a star company on Bay Street Penderfund Capital Management associate portfolio manager Amar Pandya said  and then it was targeted by short sellers in 2018 Spruce Point Capital Management accused the spacetech company of overcapitalizing costs by inflating intangible asset purchases To make matters worse the company reported an earnings miss for the third quarter which immediately resulted in its stock cratering Since the beginning of the year Maxars stock has lost about 80 per cent of its value and closed Friday at 1607 The stocks performance has chased away investors  and thats why Pandya thinks its attractive Good news may be on the way in 2019 as the company is becoming USdomiciled which opens up opportunities to bid on larger US defence contracts Pandya said he also believes that Maxar will either wind down or sell its struggling GEO satellite production business which management blamed for the earnings miss Its the perfect setup right Pandya saidDollarama would be more profitable if it hiked product prices to 5 says Izet Elmazi of Bristol Gate Capital PartnersPeter J Thompson  National Post file photoIzet Elmazi Bristol Gate Capital PartnersThe Stock Dollarama Inc TSXDOLDollarama Inc is close to reaching its floor after being targeted by short sellers Bristol Gate Capital Partners senior portfolio manager Izet Elmazi said and its offering investors an opportunity to buy low On Oct 31 Spruce Point Capital Management predicted Dollaramas stock would drop 40 per cent because customers would push back over recent price hikes and the chain would not be able to keep the same level of profitability The stock has since dropped about 13 per cent and closed Friday at 3167 Elmazi expects Dollarama to introduce 5 price points as similar chains in the US  Family Dollar and Dollar General  have done but instead of suffering he thinks it will improve their gross profit Instead of making 40 per cent of a 1 item a 5 price point would see them earn 2 for every sale Samestore traffic which declined in the last two quarters of 2018 concerns Elmazi The fact that sales are up however may instead point to a trend of customers making fewer trips but leaving with fuller baskets Growing sales would naturally lead to more stores opening  60 per year over the next five years Elmazi hopes  which has led him to believe the stock has a 60 per cent upsideTalbot Babineau IBV CapitalThe Stock Trinity Industries Inc NYSETRNTrinity Industries Inc is flying below the radar for most investors IBV Capital president and CEO Talbot Babineau said and thats partly why the company is so interesting to him The midcap firm is the largest purchaser of rolled steel in North America Babineau said and uses it to manufacture 40 per cent of the continents rail cars In November the company split into two and the branch of Trinity that was focused on producing other infrastructure products became Arcosa Inc The split savaged Trinitys stock resulting in more than a 27 per cent drop from its 52week high in October to its Friday close at US2043 Babineau thinks the company is poised to recover from its stock drop in 2019 and that rise may begin with its plan to raise US360 million in debt to conduct an accelerated share repurchase program Trinity may also benefit from the government of Albertas plans to spend 350 million on 7000 tank cars Babineau said Investors may also be drawn to the company for defensive purposes Trinitys railcar leasing program acts like one big

the UKs Brexit talks and the choice of a new European Central Bank presidentThe Financial Times annually asks a panel of eurozone analysts and economists to make their predictions for the year ahead The general feeling is that growth in 2019 will be subdued not least because of tension with the US over trade but few see the eurozone economy going off a cliffThe end of Mario Draghis eightyear term at the ECB will usher in a new president and perhaps a new era of policymaking The choice of a successor will still be subject to the usual EU political horsetrading but one name comes to the fore in

not as strongly as in 2017Anatoli Annenkov Senior European Economist Socit Gnrale17 Despite the weak current momentum we expect the euro area to show resilience next year with the domestic economy recovering on the back of accelerating income growth resilient labour markets and decelerating headline inflation Risks have however increased and are tilted to the downside A key risk relates to the investment outlook which could be more significantly affected by the current high or increasing level of uncertainty Policymakers will thus need to stay alert with the ECB likely to add another TLTRO

Commission about the negative consequences of trade tensionsAnonymous15 below forecasts due to global uncertaintiesAnonymous16  We see the current economic weakness as a temporary phenomenon caused by the problems of the German car industry with the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure the low water of the Rhine the yellow vests protests in France and the unclear Italian budget situation Growth should rebound to rates slightly above potential from 2019 Q1 onAntonio Garcia Pascual Chief European Economist Barclays15 Growth in Europe has disappointed significantly this year with gross domestic product regularly printing below expectations Our analysis points to mostly external factors with an extraordinarily favourable 2017 followed by much weaker net exports in 2018 This implies limited scope for a significant rebound especially if global trade weakens but it also suggests stabilisation towards trend growth rather than recessionary dynamicsCarsten Brzeski Chief Economist ING Germany14 Looks worse than it actually is as it is mainly the result of a still weak Q4 performance and only a gradual rebound in Q1 The soft patch of the summer turns out longerlasting than initially thought However in the course of 2019 the eurozone economy should gain new momentum on the back of higher purchasing power stronger investments fiscal stimulus and rebounding exportsDanae Kyriakopoulou Chief Economist and Head of Research Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum18 we have already seen signs of a slowdown in economic activity in the euro area Global and regional forces such as a deceleration in the US following continued Federal Reserve tightening and a fading of the effects of Trumps fiscal stimulus as well as uncertainty around and negative impact of Brexit will negatively impact the macroeconomic outlook for the euro area in 2019 The weakening of stimulus by the ECB net purchases reduced to zero while reinvestments continue and beginning of rate hikes later in the year will also put a brake on the recoveryDirk Schumacher Head of European Macro Research Natixis12 Several factors are currently weighing on growth and we expect this weakness to extend into early next year That said we also expect sequential growth to accelerate again during the course of the year once these headwinds dissipate and given sound

Group Chief Economist UniCredit17 but huge downside risk as the Chinese and global numbers disappoint and as the expected eurozone and German bounce from Q3 remains mostly absentFlorian Hense European Economist Berenberg13 What looks like a continued slowdown from 2017 and 2018 owes largely to a weak second half of 2018 ie a weak carryover effect and probably a still not great Q1 2019Growth can return to trend over the course of 2019 as the current external factors and political risks recede somewhat by spring next year The economic fundamentals of the eurozone remain encouragingHaving said that we cannot rule out two major risks first politics may go badly wrong think trade Brexit Italy Second even if the big risks that are currently scaring companies and households fade over the course

including a larger fiscal boostGuntram Wolff Director BruegelI would argue that risks to growth have increased and that the overall growth numbers will look worse than predicted by official institutionsJoerg Kraemer Chief Economist Commerzbank14 The slowdown in growth is primarily caused by declining demand from China But the Chinese government takes decisive countermeasures which is why China will not fall off the cliff Therefore the eurozone economy should stabilise in spring next year The upswing is not yet overJohn Llewellyn Partner Llewellyn Consulting15 Negatives the recent fall in confidence and trade and political uncertainty Counterbalance loose monetary policy and fiscal slippageKen Wattret Chief European Economist IHS Markit14 The euro area economy is forecast to grow at a pace broadly equal to its potential rate with the annual average increase for 2019 as a whole boosted by a temporary boost at the start of the year The latter reflects an unwind of autumn 2018s auto sector drag and fiscal stimulus in the three largest euro area economiesContext is important 2017s growth rate of 25 was exceptional driven by an unusually favourable combination of tailwinds The effects of some of those tailwinds started to fade during 2018 and in some cases became headwinds The drag from high oil prices will face during 2019 but the key headwinds weaker external demand and heightened uncertainty will continue to weighRecent data show increasing crossinfection from weaker external to domestic demand with the ebbing rate of job creation a key transmission channelLorenzo

Heise Chief Economist Allianz SE16 in 2019Economic momentum in the eurozone has cooled notably following the Euroboom year of 2017 Weaker external demand has been the key driver behind the growth moderation Oneoff factors including first and foremost disruption in car production due to new emission testing procedures have also played a role but forwardlooking indicators are not indicative of a clear stabilisation yet and rather than pointing to a quick rebound in the near term suggest lower growth is here to stay Meanwhile the accumulation of political risks including a nodeal Brexit scenario a renewed debt crisis in Italy and a further escalation in the trade dispute is increasingly weighing on economic sentiment with firms proving more cautious in investment and hiring decisions Are we nearing the end of the growth cycle While we are definitely getting closer we are not expecting the next recession to hit in 2019 There are still convincing arguments in favour of the upswing to continue albeit at a more moderate pace with private consumption propped up for now by resilient employment growth We expect GDP growth to slow but to remain decent at 16 in 2019 above the potential rate for the fifth consecutive year after 19 in 2018 as the weakness in export demand persists and increasingly feeds through to eurozone domestic demandMujtaba Rahman Managing Director

next year towards core inflation which remains on a very gradual and subdued upward path We are much less optimistic on the core inflation outlook than the ECB in 2020 and 2021 suggesting that it will take a long time for the ECB to meet its target We agree with the ECB that capacity is tight in the euro area and markets will need to stay attentive to any upside surprises to wage growth and core

potential underlying pressure on the aggregate price level remains mutedKen Wattret Chief European Economist IHS MarkitThe upward push from higher oil prices is now reversing with the headline rate of inflation set to fall back below 2 in the coming months The key issue remains however the failure of underlying inflation to sustain any upward momentum Compensation and unit labour cost growth rates have picked up markedly partly reflecting disappointing productivity growth But it is increasingly difficult for businesses to pass on higher input costs given weaker demand reflected in the output price subindices of the PMIsThe ECBs expectation of sustained above potential growth and a significantly positive output gap generating progressively higher core inflation has been blown off courseLorenzo Codogno Founder and Chief Economist LCMA12 Downward pressure again coming from lower oil pricesMichael Heise Chief Economist Allianz SE17 in 2019Inflation is registering in several eurozone countries above the ECB target of close to but below 2 helped by energy price increases over the summer months The inflationary outlook however is less encouraging For one core inflation remains rather muted at around 1 roughly where it has been since 2013 Wage growth has been stronger than anticipated in 2018 but the pass through to inflation has proven relatively weak Meanwhile

even halfhearted initiatives towards greater unionAlberto Gallo Portfolio Manager and Head of Macro Strategies Algebris Investments The potential for the European Parliament to shift towards Eurosceptic groups should create more sense of urgency across member states around fiscal policy Since the crisis Europe relied too much on QE and the ECB did most of the heavy lifting Governments need to step up their game and understand that austerity has not worked and that QE without a fiscal stimulus does not evenly benefit the real economy creating differences between small and large firms which fund in bond markets and between the rich and poorAnatoli Annenkov European Economist Socit GnraleCompared with previous EP elections the stakes are much higher Given the many incomplete EU projects and challenges the next parliament and European Commission will have a decisive role in designing the future of the EU and of its institutional framework Overall a more fragmented parliament than in the past is likely suggesting that at least three party groups may be needed for majority This in turn could imply a more difficult and lengthy process of appointing a new

of a not very proEuropean European Parliament the agenda to build more Europe and resilience against the next crisis would be potentially diminishedCarsten Brzeski Chief Economist ING GermanyVery little The current fear of a significant shift towards EUsceptical parties is overdone Some parties first made big electorate gains in the EP elections before they increased in national elections There should only be very few antiEU parties which were still small in 2014 and have only gained momentum since then Also EUsceptical parties are spread over three political groups in EP making it hard to cooperateDanae Kyriakopoulou Chief Economist and Head of Research Official Monetary and Financial Institutions ForumEuropean elections tend to be fairly lowkey with little change in policy expected as a result This time could be different with the expected increase in representation by populist and Eurosceptic representatives that would be the case in individual countries but may not be the case for the parliament on aggregate owing to the absence of the UK The euro is entering its third decade and after a decade of boom and a decade of crisis this could prove an important one in terms of how the union proceeds towards further integration disintegration convergence or divergence Beyond the parliament the focus will also be on the musical chairs for top posts at the ECB the

prove highly polarising Despite a strong expected turnout for Eurosceptic parties a grand coalition of mainstream parties remains our baseline scenario A higher share of hard populists in the EU

the eurozones thirdlargest economyAlastair Winter Chief Economist Daniel Stewart amp CompanyMatteo Salvini will want a domestic election if the European one goes well for the League His aim is probably still to bully EU into concessions on the budget immigration and Russian sanctions rather than Italexit as soon as 2019 Any success might help growth a bit but pressure will mount to pursue more drastic measures such as a parallel currency in 2020Alberto Gallo Portfolio Manager and Head of Macro Strategies Algebris InvestmentsItalys growth has already suffered from a loss of credibility and investment resulting from policy uncertainty under the current Five Star League coalition as shown by PMI and growth data We believe the country will get another quarter of nearzero QoQ growth

leader of a new government coalition This could for example combine the League with Forza Italia with a probusiness policyAnatoli Annenkov European Economist Socit GnraleThe current political situation in Italy is not very helpful for the Italian growth outlook As significant policy uncertainty leading to tighter financial conditions has been introduced the potential positive impact from a looser fiscal stance can be expected to be insignificant None of the proposed budget measures are likely to boost potential growth significantly and there is a high risk that the current government will not hold together again raising policy risk and uncertainty into future electionsAndr Sapir Senior Fellow and Professor Bruegel and Universit libre de BruxellesThe domestic political climate will

BarclaysWe have downgraded our projected growth outlook for Italy to 09 in 2018 and 04 in 2019 from respectively 10 and 09 previously This follows the release of the final GDP expenditures breakdown for Q3 showing that the sudden stop recorded in real growth cannot be attributed exclusively to temporary factors but is mainly due to slowing private consumption and investments owing to political instability We expect private sector precautionary savings seen in Q3 despite largely unchanged domestic demand conditions to persist in the coming quarters dragging Italy into a shortlived economic recession until fiscal easing measures announced by the government kick in most likely in Q2Q3 next yearCarsten Brzeski Chief Economist ING GermanyIn the coming months the political tensions between Rome and Brussels should have a negative impact on consumer and business confidence keeping Italy close to stagnation In the course of 2019 however once it has become obvious that a compromise between Rome and Brussels is possible the positive impact from fiscal stimulus as well as improving sentiment should lead to a rebound of the Italian economyDanae Kyriakopoulou Chief Economist and Head of Research Official Monetary and Financial Institutions ForumItaly is a big risk for the euro area economy in 2019 The differences between the European Commission and the current Italian leadership will need to be carefully managed especially timingwise given the upcoming European Parliament elections in May and the potential impact a fine could have on the rhetoric different political parties may choose to use There is also a sense of complacency in terms of the readiness of euroarea institutions and the ESM to respond to a potential Italian crisisDirk Schumacher Head of European Macro Research NatixisThe high spreads will weigh further on growth as financial conditions for the Italian private sector will tighten Because of this we expect the Italian government to eventually adjust its tone further on the back of the weakening macroeconomic environmentErik Nielsen Group Chief Economist UniCreditItalian GDP of about 34 of a per cent in 2019 but it assumes a toning down of antiEuropean rhetoric and threats of unsustainable fiscal measuresFlorian Hense European Economist BerenbergThe spending plans of the radical government in combination with the resulting rise in risk premia and the concerns about parts of the banking system are taking their toll on Italys economic performance already Anecdotal evidence of an emerging credit crunch in Italy seems to have registered especially with the League which draws a significant part of its support from small and mediumsized businesses in Northern Italy As a result Italy has started to back down and will probably muddle through in 2019 instead of descending into a fullblown debt crisisBut once the next global recession reveals the underlying weaknesses of the Italian economy in say 2021 a massive selloff in Italian debt may still force Rome to choose between serious progrowth reforms coupled with an end to spending excesses and leaving the euro We do not expect an Italexit to happen but we cannot rule it out

to win many architectural awards But to Nick Kittredge it is a thing of beauty Mr Kittredge is a senior executive at logistics company Prologis The 200000squarefoot facility in the industrial town of Elizabeth New Jersey is one of its latest bets on a warehouse gold rush that is being fuelled by the growth of ecommerceRents for industrial real estate a category that largely comprises warehouses are rising at doubledigit rates in more than a dozen US markets Vacancies are at historic lows and new investors are piling into the sector even as other parts of the property industry are softeningDemand for industrial in the US is off the charts said Revathi Greenwood head of US research at Cushman amp Wakefield That market is completely on steroidsTH Real Estate an investment manager has estimated that total returns for warehouses will be double those of other US property sectors this year The Pension Real Estate Association is predicting they will outpace other property categories at least to the end of 2022 In some ways the warehouse boom is the flipside of a retail property market blighted by bankruptcies and store closures as shoppers move online Demand is so intense that in some markets developers have taken the onceunheardof step of tearing down office properties to convert them to warehousesErik Caldwell chief operating officer of XPO Logistics which owns 813 warehouses more than half outside the US estimated that ecommerce now accounts for about 30 per cent of its business The company is opening an average of two new warehouse facilities each week Consumer demand is fuelling tremendous growth in retail and ecommerce Mr Caldwell explained It makes for heady times for Mr Kittredge who runs Prologiss east coast operations and fellow denizens of industrial real estate once an industry backwater They find themselves suddenly bathing in a limelight typically reserved for colleagues from the more glamorous worlds of residential and commercial realty We certainly feel that this is our time in the sun he said At Cushman some of the topranked brokers a matter of great prestige internally are now industrial specialists and have even begun to feature in the companys annual presentationAll of a sudden its sexy to be an industrial broker said Andrew Judd a senior managing director who runs the companys office in northern New Jersey sounding as surprised as anyonePrologiss 200000 sq ft warehouse in Elizabeth New Jersey  Cynthia van ElkFTFor years that was not the case The warehouse market was boringly stable until it was hit by the 2008 financial crisis A strengthening economy stabilised rents after a few yearsThey have since taken off with the emergence of ecommerce which is fast changing the rules of retail and logistics Among other shifts companies are now seeking abundant warehouse space close to their customers to manage an evergrowing volume of last mile deliveries that must be made on evertighter deadlinesA retailer that used to ship goods to a store once a week now makes daily deliveries in an effort to keep pace with Amazon the leading online retailer Retailers must also keep a far greater supply of items in stock than they did in the bricksandmortar era Several put the ratio at about 31 That includes extra capacity to handle the many items that online shoppers returnIn seven or eight years youve kind of invented a new industry said Stan Danzig a Cushman vicechair who has been working in the industrial market since 1981By way of example Mr Danzig pointed to New Jersey where Amazon did not have a single warehouse as recently as 2012 It now has nine Wherever Amazon goes its competitors tend to quickly follow creating warehouse clustersWhile the warehouse boom is pushing up property values across the US particularly in pockets near large population centres northern New Jersey may be its Mecca In addition to its own sizeable population it also boasts proximity to New York and the bustling Port of NewarkDevelopers built a record 9m sq ft of new warehouse space in the state in 2017 and will surpass that with 10m sq ft this year Rents that averaged just 510 per square foot in 2012 have since jumped to 847 according to Cushman They appear to be accelerating with a 17 per cent increase in the third quarter compared with the same period a year earlierMany of the properties are strung along the New Jersey Turnpike where brokers refer to distinct markets by the corresponding highway exit and rents tend to descend the further south one drives from New York These are not the warehouses from Mr Danzigs early days in the business Facilities that once spanned 50000 sq ft now routinely exceed 1m The quality of the slabs they sit atop is vital because of the accumulated pounding from so much traffic Tenants also demand as much as 40ft in clearance so that they can stack storage shelves high and driveways designed to accommodate the turning radius of dozens of 53ft tractor trailersA warehouse in Edison New Jersey owned by Prologis Part of the building is rented by Dotcom Distribution a logistics fulfilment management service  Cynthia van ElkFTSome of the

the vicepresident of marketing explained the business as a group of workers prepared for the holiday seasonThe facility measures 650ft across making workers on the far end appear like specks Yet Dotcom is perpetually seeking to squeeze more value from the space to try to offset rising rent and labour costsOne fix is to shift to increasingly narrow aisles a mere six feet across in some places that are traversed by wireguided lifts that allow human pickers to scale 40ft shelves to select merchandise for customer orders On a recent afternoon a picker was traversing an aisle selecting among a wall of hundreds of trays containing mens underwear in all shapes sizes and styles They belong to Underwear Expert an online retailer that ships its customers a new pair of skivvies each month Dotcom may not find much more space in New Jersey Realtors say there are few greenfield sites remaining Many otherwise appealing plots have environmental or structural problems that may make it costly and timeconsuming to develop For Mr Kittredge such challenges are also a sign of his industrys transformation For a long timethe cocktail conversation around warehouses was pretty shortlived he recalled But now with ecommerce theres just a lot of excitement

than Niagara Falls when the water level is low and that the setup instructions were impossible to follow Oops this is supposed to be a positive review So yeah the LED light is nice I guessIll never actually post that but it could have been worth money if I had Let me explain I visited aFacebookgroup called Amazon Reviews and was promised a full refund on a 44 Amazon purchase of a pet fountain if I did the following on the megaretailers site1 Write a positive review2 Post my photos of the product3 Rate it five starsNot only is this ethically problematic it is also against Amazon and Facebook user policies Plenty of people dont care though Theyll do it for this pet gizmo or one of the other bajillion products in these forumsEvery day many of us search for a product on Amazon pick a four to fivestar option and tap Buy Now Those little yellow stars can make or break a productIn early 2012 the Amazon catalog grew too big and the only way to get to the top of search results was to prove to the algorithm that your product was the best said Juozas Kaziuknas chief executive of Marketplace Pulse a businessintelligence firm focused on ecommerce Most sellers realized acquiring reviews was a golden ticketOver the past few years Amazon has cracked down on fake reviews as well as on incentivized reviews where companies offer refunds to shoppers in exchange for top stars However my hours lurking in shady Facebook groups and combing Amazon reviews tell me both types are very much still alive and wellIts on us to better understand the complicated world of Amazon reviews before we make a purchase But its on Amazon to start rethinking the star system entirelyThe Types of ReviewsThere are four species of Amazon reviewA legit review Left by a human who bought a product and felt like sharing the legit review often labeled as a Verified Purchase might be peppered with reallife experiences that indicate genuine useLegit reviewers tend to be moved to review when they love or hate the product so the ratings are more extreme says Tommy Noonan founder of ReviewMeta a website that analyzes Amazon reviewsA Vine review Amazon invites some of the most prolific legit reviewers to be a part of Vine The program rewards them with free products in exchange for reviews marked with a green label Vine members choose from a preselected group of products but neither Amazon nor the company that provides the product can influence edit or modify reviews Amazon saysAmazon Vine reviewers I interviewed say they dont let the perk influence their ratings and showed me many negative reviews they have written ReviewMeta found Vine reviewers give more two three and fourstar reviews than other groupsI write reviews because this is a way for me to have a voiceon the garbage products and the great products said Kathleen San Martino of Morris County New Jersey She has reviewed approximately 1500I repeat 1500products on Amazon over the years To see her in my video click here Vine reviewers do pay something The products value is considered taxable incomeAn incentivized review Incentivized reviewers are given free productsor in some cases flatout paymentsin exchange for four or five stars In 2016 Amazon updated its terms of service to prohibit this practice but sellers found a big back alley FacebookHeres how it works A shopper joins a Facebook group with a name like Amazon reviews These groups tend to be private but I was let into two even after saying I was a journalistSellers often out of China post about free products say Bluetooth headphones The buyer gets the Amazon link from the seller via direct message orders the headphones through Amazon so it can appear as a Verified Purchase then writes the review posts some photos and rates it five stars Once proof of purchase is provided the seller refunds the buyer generally viaPayPalThe moderator of one of the Facebook productreview groups I joined directed me to his rules which state that members are meant to write honest unbiased reviews and that the group isnt responsible for deceitful posts or dishonest reviews left by buyerssellers Facebook says it closes groups that offer incentives for fake reviews Amazon says it works with Facebook to police these groupsI spoke with various reviewers in these groups many of whom didnt want to be identified They say they write these types of reviews to save moneyThe Shady SideSome categories on Amazon draw the most questionable potentially fake product reviews according to ReviewMeta Here are 10 of the most targeted categories Earbud headphonesScreen protectorsWeightloss supplementsHairloss productsBaby monitorsTestosterone boostersStreaming media playersPhone charging cablesDiaper bagsMP3 and MP4 playersI definitely gave a 4 or 5star review to stuff that wasnt good said Jeffrey Chu from Charlotte NC who reviewed products from Facebook groups until Amazon blocked him from reviewing last year I felt a little bit bad about doing it but even before this I noticed a lot of BS reviews I figured the system was broken I figured Id get stuff out of itThe fake review Finally there are the fullon fakes These reviews dont show verified purchases and consistently deliver high ratings without much detail One person I saw on Craigslist offers reviews starting at 5 a pop Socalled click farms in Asia claim to control thousands of Amazon accounts that vendors can hire to leave reviews for between 1 and 5 eachSellers also hijack legit reviews through some backend trickery Mr Noonan said A merchant might put a new item on the page of a wellreviewed but nowunavailable older product The star rating looks good but the reviews dont match the itemFighting BackAmazon is on high alert right now cracking down on scams and fake reviews and deleting thousands of suspect reviewsWe suspend ban or pursue legal action against these bad actors as well as suppress all known inauthentic reviews an Amazon spokeswoman said Customers can report suspicious reviews 24 hours a day seven days a week and we investigate each claimLast week I spotted a listing for headphones branded Wotmic with 51 fivestar ratingsand no poorer ratings This week Amazons sweep removed all 51 reviews Wotmics parent company Shenzhen Womaisi Technology Co Ltd hasnt responded to repeated requests for commentAnother page I found featured a teeth whitener with an apparent average 45star rating However many of the written reviews pertained to fish oil cinnamon tablets and other health products When I reached out the vendor AsaVea didnt respondbut soon all but the relevant reviews disappeared Negative reviews complaining about the apparent review hijacking also remained The product is now rated three starsMany dubious reviews still slip past the sentries so we all have to follow three stepsStep 1 Skip stars Read the textEven just skimming the written reviews section will allow you to spot red flags Be on the lookout for potential product swaps or for a bunch of genericsounding fivestar reviews posted on the same date Click on reviewers to see what else theyve writtenStep 2 Try a review rating siteReviewMeta and Fakespot automatically look for those red flags and more Paste in an Amazon product page address and either site gives you a review of the reviews They both calculate the average star rating with questionable reviews removed I prefer ReviewMeta for its more comprehensive report cardsStep 3 Take everything with a grain of saltDont believe everything you read Amazon says it gives more weight to reviews deemed helpful by shoppers but many star ratings might still be artificially inflatedAfter all my reporting my conclusion is that the star system itself is the culprit Im not the first to reach this conclusion Netflix moved to a thumbsupthumbsdown system with more personalized recommendations after acknowledging star problemsIm not sure how Amazon would adapt that sort of system but certainly one of the worlds most valuable companies with more than 600000 employees and a major investment in artificial intelligence can try to figure it out Hopefully before we all buy twostar pet fountains masquerading as fivestar onesFor

four I discovered this when I found a forgotten LL Bean puffer smushed in the nether regions of my closet Why you might ask did I buy a jacket I didnt need The eternal reason because it was on sale Last February Id wandered into an LL Bean in suburban Maryland to kill some time before dinner with zero intention to buy anything Then I stumbled on a deal that felt too good to pass up and just like that I was down 75 and pointlessly up a down coat Thanks to other similarly discounted missteps along with my enthusiasm for buying secondhand my closet is impossibly bloated with stuff More white shirts than I could wear in a week More suits than I need for the handful of formal events I attend each year So please help me out Take this puffer off my hands so I can relieve my closet of at least one coatYour closet however is likely as overstuffed as mine There seems to be more clothing for men than before said Ayako Homma a senior consultant at market research provider Euromonitor International According to Euromonitor the global mens fashion market has grown 38 between 2008 and 2017 ballooning to a 4194 billion dollar industry up from 3035 billion in 2008 Were collectively buying more yet are continually confronted with the dilemma of what to wear because these teeming closets often lack organization The solution Winnow down our existing wardrobes and then buy less and with more clarity Though challenging the winnowing part of this strategy is hardly a radical move these days As clothing consumption has ramped up so has an equal and opposite movement toward austerity or at least moderation John Peabody a 37yearold Brooklyn creative strategist used to leaf through his hangers and marvel at how much he spent on clothes he didnt wear He eventually came to his senses and pared his closet down to a mostlyblue uniform As Mr Peabody found life with less clothing and greater strategy can be liberating This widespread urge to edit can be traced in part to Japanese author Marie Kondos bestseller The LifeChanging Magic of Tidying Up The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing which popularized a lessismore mentality when it arrived in the US in 2014 We have collectively realized that more does not equal better Ms Kondo whose new Netflix show Tidying Up with Marie Kondo debuts this week wrote over email With the internet shopping boom and discount stores that sell cheap goods Ms Kondo believes many people have just finally grown weary of it all Her fellow evangelists internet broadcasters Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus known as the Minimalists have since 2010 preached a sheditall message to millions through YouTube videos and podcasts Tap MinimalWardrobe into Instagram and youll find over 10000 posts many showing a single steel rack with a weeks work of clothes an aesthetically pleasing if strict way to plan ones wardrobe  An overfull closet makes me feel mentally cluttered whereas being pareddown gives me clarity said Chris Dolan 42 the director of data platforms at a software company in Newton Mass Chris Dam 33 an account executive at an education startup in Cincinnati took an extreme approach last year by purging half his clothing He did so by eliminating the things that didnt match cohesively with my wardrobe as a whole Gone for example were the cream jeans which he bought on sale intending to wear them rakishly with a navy blazer in the summer yet ultimately never wore An overfull closet can make me feel mentally cluttered The closet should reflect the persons current lifestyle recommended Barbara Reich owner of Resourceful Consultants a life and homeorganizing service in New York Eliminate what she calls aspirational clutter in both officewear dont hoard 16 suits if you work at a casual office and hobby attire if your cycling days are behind you give up the spandex Nostalgic items can be hardest to shed Edwin Zee 32 a marketing analytics manager for Zendesk in Berkeley Calif was hoarding clothes hed inherited from his father but never wore and concert Tshirts for bands he didnt listen to anymore With a cramped twobedroom apartment and a newborn due he finally summoned the will to purge these items but others lack motivation Linda Rothschild who runs a movingmanagement and organizing business in New York recommends a ripofftheBandAid approach for cherished clutter Take a picture of it if you need to remember it for some reason but if you dont have the room for it dont waste the space When we say throw it out we dont mean it literally According to the EPA 105 million tons of textiles wound up in landfills in 2015 so its best to donate or recycle instead of adding to that mound Ms Rothschild noted that massmarket retailerHampMwill take any clothing item and recycle it andNikewill recycle its old sneakers Madewell takes old jeans back in exchange for a discount on new ones Designer resale sites like the Real Real and Grailed which launched in 2011 and 2014 respectively have made it easier to get a return on the highticket items that you splurged on In the past couple of years Ive used Grailed to sell Junya Watanabe jeans that were too big and decadesold Jil Sander suits given to me by a friendHowever buying less in the first place is even more sustainable Once youve ruthlessly culled your closet dont race to fill it againeasier said than done in a world in which roundtheclock shopping has become nearinescapable The clickandship ease of ecommerce has contributed to our clothing overload Without ever getting into your car or dealing with a salesperson you can have shirts sneakers and even bespoke suits spirited to your doorstep Meanwhile cookies and algorithms weaponize your online queries and badger you into buying I do a search for pants and now Im seeing them everywhere said the platforms director Mr Dolan The clothes we Google or the ads we click on Facebook can trail us around the internet until finally we snap and click Buy now To buy less impulsively closet organizer Ms Reich suggests grouping items in your existing wardrobe by category and color so you easily spot a hole or imbalancesay you own two gray trousers but 11 navy She also advises a oneinoneout mentality Buy a new black sweater to replace an old oneKeep a shopping list on hand as Mr Zee does to ensure you buy only clothing you need during sale season Thanks to this approach he is satisfied with his pareddown closet though yields to the occasional splurge Its like when youre dieting he said Just as you feel entitled to indulge in a few bites of cake after youve reached your goal weight buy those reissued Nikes youve been eyeing once your closet is sufficiently airy againTo keep those splurges from spiraling out of control Mr Peabody ponders clothing in the context of his larger goals I think of things in terms of surfboards or plane tickets he said Like I could take a trip to Italy for a week or I could have this jacket Good advice for

one.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/rubios-buyback-tax-11545082893,2018-12-17 21:41:36,Sen Marco Rubio R Fla is rolling out a new plan for business tax hikes while simultaneously acknowledging the recent success of business tax cuts Even in Washington arent people supposed to learn from their mistakes In 2017 Mr Rubio held up passage of the historic reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate to 21 from 35 until his fellow Republicans agreed to expand refunds for people who dont pay any federal income taxes A habitual user of Democratic talking points questioning the benefits of corporate ratecutting Mr Rubio now writes in the Atlantic For all of the criticism it has received the 2017 Republican tax law addressed a universally recognized problem an old corporate tax structure that left us uncompetitive with the rest of the world But lets not mistake this first step for the final destination The question workers face going forward isnt whether tax cuts will bring capital back to the United States its where that capital will go once its here Its nice to see another skeptic acknowledging that the tax cut succeeded in bringing capital back to the US But why is it Mr Rubios business how people choose to invest it here The problem is that he really doesnt understand where the capital goes A corporate taxrate cut writes Mr Rubio is as likely to induce stock buybacks as it is to spur the construction of new American factories Like Hillary Clinton and Sen Chuck Schumer D NY among others Mr Rubio thinks that when a company uses its cash to buy back its own shares this occurs at the expense of investment It doesnt have to work this way continues the Florida pol Supplyside theorythat increased investment benefits workers in the long runonly works if investment actually increases Investment has actually increased After two years of nearly zero growth ending in 2016 private nonresidential investment has since risen smartly despite tightening monetary policy In other words businesses see more opportunities to invest and they are doing so And in cases where firms dont see a good opportunity to expand they are buying back their shares allowing investors to use the cash to invest in other businesses with better opportunities Perhaps because he is unaware that business investment has surgedexactly as the architects of the corporate rate cut intendedMr Rubio now proposes to tax buybacks as a way to force businesses to make investments their shareholders dont want them to make Writes Mr Rubio The conventional wisdom among corporate management and investors today is that buybacks dont come at the expense of investment because they return capital to shareholders to be put to better use elsewhere This objection misses the point When a corporation uses its profits to buy back stock it is actively deciding that returning capital to shareholders is a better activity for business than investing in the companys product or workforce The tax preference for buybacks tilts the scale in this direction creating a bias against productive investment Its cute that Mr Rubio is positioning himself against the conventional wisdom of the people who own the assets that he and liberal politicians want to reallocate But he is the one missing the point A company that actively decides to plow money into a product no one wants out of a conviction that such investments are inherently more virtuous than returning cash to shareholders will not be able to employ a workforce for very long Mr Rubios embrace of Beltway wisdom prevents him from grasping that taxing buybacks would encourage less productive investment  In Other News When Youve Lost Public Broadcasting Political and legal danger for President Trump may be sharpening by the day but the case that his campaign might have conspired with the Russian attack on the 2016 election is still unproven despite two years of investigations court filings and even numerous convictions and guilty pleas Trump has been implicated in ordering a scheme to silence two women ahead of Election Day in 2016 about the alleged sexual relationships they had with him years before That is a serious matter or it might have been in other times but this scheme is decidedly not a global conspiracy with a foreign power to steal the election  NPR national security editor Philip Ewing December 15  Collateral

since the financial crisis and pay rising faster than inflation This year promises to be even more turbulent with the UK due to leave the EU in March but with the details surrounding its departure yet to be agreed The FT asked 81 economists to peer into their crystal balls and answer a variety of questions about the economy this year Overall they were pessimistic about 2019 with almost all forecasting that uncertainty around Brexit will hobble economic growth in the short term Most said it was impossible to make any forecasts with certainty those who ventured predictions said that growth would likely remain at its current lacklustre level of 15 per cent Here are their responses to six questions about the economyTo what extent will Brexitrelated uncertainty in the first quarter of the year affect the UK economyHoward Archer chief economic adviser EY ITEM ClubMarkedly Confidence indicators for December show weakened consumer and business sentiment amid heightened Brexit uncertaintiesThis looks certain to weigh down on business investment in particular and likely in many cases to result in caution over committing to major new businesscontracts Consumer caution is also likely especially in relation to purchases of bigticket items The housing market is likely to be mutedMuch will depend on how Brexit matters develop through the first quarter If there is a lack of progress in the early weeks of 2019 and it looks like a nodeal UK exit from the EU is becoming more and more likely the negative impact on the economy will be magnified However there could be some limiting impact on how much GDP growth or lack of growth is affected by stock building as businesses look to protect their supplies There could also be some element of consumers making precautionary buys of some itemsAlternatively if it looks ever more likely that a nodeal exit will be averted some of the uncertainty may ease although it is unlikely to disappear completely until it is absolutely guaranteed there will be a dealNicholas Barr professor of public economics LSEConsiderably given uncertainty about a which route to Brexit or not is taken and b the uncertainty associated with the chosen route eg if there is a second referendum uncertainty about the resultRay Barrell professor Brunel universityGrowth will continue to stagnate until the situation over Brexit becomes clear Output will rise fall or remain the same as projected depending on which of the exit or stay options arrivesMarian Bell Alpha EconomicsIn the face of continuing Brexitrelated uncertainty businesses have scaled back investment in the UK and made decisions to move operations overseas By the third quarter of 2018 cumulative GDP growth since the referendum was 1 percentage point lower than had previously been expected Business is now being told to prepare for a nodeal Brexit and increasing numbers will relocate some operations These decisions may not be reversed even in the event of the best possible outcome for the economy which would be to remain in the EU The damage done to the UK economy by allowing Brexitrelated uncertainty to rise going into the first quarter is likely to be long lastingNeil Blake global head of forecasting CBREA lotDanny Blanchflower professor Dartmouth CollegeI think uncertainty is one of the major issues in 2019 Businesses are surely going to sit on their hands in terms of investment either deferring until later or moving elsewhere Maybe consumers will start to precautionary save for what is coming Either way this looks badNick Bosanquet professor of health policy Imperial CollegeAt best a drag on investment and marketing at worst hard Brexit panic leading to 3 per cent fall in GDP over 2019George Buckley chief UK and euro area economist NomuraThe outcome of Brexit is still a big unknown There are four main options i Mays deal ii another deal eg Norway for now iii no deal or iv remain In the case of the latter two uncertainty could increase materially either in the long run no deal or in the shorter term as another referendum question is unlikely to be decided quickly This uncertainty is most likely to be felt in investment business investment has already fallen for three consecutive quarters something which hasnt happened since the crisis To the extent that uncertainty shows up in sterling that could further add to import prices and inflation thereby reducing real consumer spendingSarah Carlson Moodys Investors ServiceDeclining investment is a major reason why the UK is the only major economy whose growth has slipped far below trend We think that persistent uncertainty over Brexit will continue to dampen longterm investment business expansion and economic activityJagjit Chadha director National Institute of Economic and Social ResearchUncertainty related to EU exit takes a number of forms in terms of the type of exit when we exit and indeed whether we exit We also do not know how our trading relationships for goods and services as well as capital and labour will evolve for the rest of the world on exit So even if the first set of uncertainties are resolved in some manner in the first quarter of next year the second set of uncertainties could still weigh on activity that depends on forwardlooking plans Such uncertainty has already depressed domestic investment and probably impacted on inward FDI and so to some extent seems likely to continue to do soDavid Cobham professor HeriotWatt UniversityTo a significant extent it seems we can already see this in the lowish retail figures for the Christmas quarterBrian Coulton chief economist Fitch RatingsYes business investment and consumer spending will be subdued even if there is resolution before March If it goes right to the wire then the impact will be deeperDiane Coyle Bennett professor of public policy University of CambridgeSignificantly It already is of course Apart from slower UK growth compared to other OECD economies the fall in the pound raising the cost of imports will have done at least as much to hammer the high street as other factors like business rates or online competition Uncertainty has a chilling effect on investment hiring and spending plans at the best of times This is not the best of times Its hard to believe any business in Britain will sign off on new investments or expansion at present Of course there might be a shortterm boost to sales of essentials before the end of March I for one am stockpiling given the number of our politicians who seem to think a nodeal exit is no problemBronwyn Curtis independent economistIn the short term it will be most of the small to mediumsized companies who have until now expected that the government will negotiate something sensible They are not prepared for a sudden transition and will spend time in Q1 focusing on Brexit rather than building their businesses Consumers have already pulled back and we will see the impact of that when the Christmas spending numbers come in The fall in spending will not be reversed in Q1 Large businesses have already made their decisions and moved whatever they can into the EU just in case Wealthy individuals have also moved to shelter their assets This will hurt the economy medium to longterm as these are mostly the biggest taxpayers but the impact will be spread over time Howard Davies chairman RBSThe impact on investment in particular could be quite severe unless a deal is ratified at the beginning of JanuaryPanicos Demetriades professor of financial economics University of LeicesterI cannot envisage any scenario under which Brexitrelated uncertainty will disappear in Q1 If a peoples vote is agreed it will not happen in Q1 If the UK exits under Mrs Mays deal on 29 March uncertainty will continue because details are still not finalised the agreement with the EU is more of a statement of intent than an accurate description of Britains future relationship with the EU In the worstcase scenario of a nodeal Brexit uncertainty if anything will be massiveWouter den Haan professor LSEUK political uncertainty is ridiculously high right now That cannot be healthy obviously Parliament accepting the negotiated deal would help in terms of reducing uncertainty but lots of uncertainty will remain and that isnt a good thingSwati Dhingra associate professor LSESlowdown like earlier low GDP growth relative to other OECD countries Dampening of investments Hard to predict numbers here because shortterm forecasts are not the most reliable but direction likely to be negativePeter Dixon economist CommerzbankWith little likelihood of a meaningful parliamentary vote until midJanuary which will almost certainly result in a rejection of the withdrawal agreement we could soon be looking into the abyss from a business planning perspective For many companies it will be too late to take meaningful measures to avoid a hard Brexit and they will have to do what they can to brace for impact in the hope we never actually get there This does imply that investment will be frozen but on the other hand we might see a lot of inventory buildup in Q1 Many households may not even be aware of the severity of the situation so we could find ourselves in a strange environment in which the medias dire warnings are not fully reflected in the economic dataNoble Francis economics director Construction Products AssociationThe increased level of uncertainty in 2018 Q4 has already led to an increase in stockpiling and a sharp fall in major investments although small investments in IT and equipment continue This will continue in January and the increase in stockpiling will provide a small boost to GDP due to the impact on inventories but this is likely to be offset by further falls in business investment What happens after January will be dependent upon a Brexit withdrawal agreement with the EU that also passes through the UK parliamentCharles Goodhart professor emeritus LSEI expect inventory accumulation to offset any reduction in fixed investment so that the UK economy will continue to grow slowly at somewhere between 025 and 05 per cent quarter on quarterAndy Goodwin associate director Oxford EconomicsUncertainty is likely to work in both directions in Q1 On one hand uncertainty around the future trading relationship with the EU is clearly discouraging companies from investing and will continue to do so until parliament finds a resolution to the current impasse But on the other hand the longer that parliament takes to approve the withdrawal agreement the more likely it will be that companies stockpile to guard against the risk of disruption after March 29 On balance I suspect there will be a small drag on activityMark Gregory chief economist EYWe may see a range of potentially contradictory effects with companies spending to prepare and to stockpile especially sectors like food and life sciences but we can also expect domestic business investment to fall and foreign direct investment to go on hold The key as always will be how consumers react but with both the UK and global economic news worsening Brexit is likely to exacerbate the fall in consumer confidenceRuth Gregory Capital EconomicsGiven that there are still numerous ways in which Brexit could unfold Brexit uncertainty which we estimate has knocked around 05 percentage points off GDP growth since the referendum seems unlikely to subside anytime soon Meanwhile stockpiling ahead of Brexit probably wont provide much of an offset Even if stockbuilding picks up in early 2019 it only makes sense for firms to stockpile imports that might be disrupted after Brexit As a result the effect on GDP growth would be neutral Overall the lack of clarity is likely to see quarterly GDP growth slow sharply to just 03 per cent in Q4 and remain subdued in Q1 2019Rebecca Harding chief executive Coriolis TechnologiesThe governments advice to business at the end of 2018 has been to prepare for a nodeal Brexit In a sense this removes the economic uncertainty the UK economy now has to brace itself for a hard landing Businesses have to be ready to trade with the EU and the rest of the world as a third country under WTO rules with a scant and temporary safety net for aerospace logistics and financial services until the end of the year Yet while the UKs trade will be slower in Q1 this is not because of its imminent exit from the EU It will be slower because the uncertainties surrounding trade finance have been evident for some time A trade finance arrangement is typically for 90120 days with shorter term financing in place for 30 or 60 days With Brexit now dangerously within this timeframe and with the government suggesting that everyone prepares for no deal the existing constraints on trade finance will inevitably become barriers No business and no bank will be prepared to take the risk of funding projects now without knowing the full costs of the finance What has been a hidden slowdown in trade finance has the potential to become a full lockdown by the end of the first quarter as Brexit day approachesJohn Hawksworth chief economist PwCThere is already considerable evidence from business surveys that Brexitrelated uncertainty has been affecting business investment significantly in recent months More tentatively there are some indications that consumer confidence and spending have also been adversely affected in the runup to Christmas although hard data on this is lacking so far The housing market has also continued to slow particularly in London We would expect these negative effects on business investment the housing market and possibly also consumer spending to persist and indeed probably intensify in the first quarter of 2019 so long as a disorderly Brexit with no transition remains a significant possibilityBrian Hilliard chief UK economist Socit GnraleIt will materially reduce growth in both consumer and investment spending below the levels that would otherwise have been reachedPaul Hollingsworth UK economist BNP ParibasThere are no signs that uncertainty which has weighed heavily on firms investment decisions over recent quarters is letting up Moreover the situation could get worse before it gets better The outlook is becoming increasingly binary with Theresa Mays deal unlikely to get through parliament leaving a choice between no deal or no Brexit on March 29 2019 Growth at the start of Q1 may remain subdued given that parliament will only be voting in midJanuary and there does not appear to be a majority yet for a specific plan B Firms may have to start implementing if they have not already their nodeal contingency plans which could include shifting labour and production abroad or stockpiling goods which would boost imports and drag on growth But there is scope for a reacceleration if and when uncertainty clearsEthan Ilzetzki lecturer LSEMuch of this uncertainty has already been priced in and has already affected the UK economy reflected in lower growth than comparable economies in the past two years Uncertainty likely peaked this month and the remaining effects will be the real effect of Brexit if and when it occursDhaval Joshi chief European strategist BCA ResearchThe uncertainty of a nodeal Brexit is akin to the uncertainty of a hurricane brewing in the Atlantic If the hurricane ends up missing you wont feel it at all And if the hurricane hits youll only really feel it when it is almost upon youStephen King senior economic adviser HSBCA tricky one to answer for the simple reason that Brexit is such an extraordinary turn of events Following the postWW1 collapse of the AustroHungarian Empire the trams in Vienna stopped running because the creation of new borders brought the supply of coal from the north to a juddering halt In the event of a nodeal Brexit arrangement we may belatedly discover how sensitive modern economies are to global and regional supply chains And even if there is a deal there may still be a lack of clarity on future trading relationships Economically at least the UK is likely to be worse off under all forms of Brexit compared with the alternative of remaining in the EUAshwin Kumar chief economist Joseph Rowntree FoundationWe have the paradoxical situation of the imminence of a nodeal Brexit also increasing the chance of no Brexit at all So whilst the prolonged uncertainty will reduce longterm investment decisions and future growth potential it may not have a dramatic shortterm effect on the economy as bets go both ways in the early part of the yearRuth Lea Economic Adviser Arbuthnot Banking GroupI would expect some further fairly modest easing in business investment say 2 per cent in the quarter It should be noted that despite some anecdotal evidence of major postponements of business investment in recent quarters the ONSs recorded data have shown very modest falls overall arguably within measurement errorConsumers and potential housebuyers could also hold back but it will be difficult to disentangle any such developments from the usual noise in the first quarter when large seasonal factors can distort underlying consumer spending figures and the weather can also have major effects I would expect little impact on government spending or indeed exportsAll in all there could be a very modest impact on GDP in 2019 Q1 and hence the labour market which is proving surprisingly resilient despite the Brexit uncertainties John Llewellyn Llewellyn ConsultingConsiderably Businesses and especially those that sell into Europe will contain their investment until they know the terms on which they will be able to export there Consumers have kept their spending going by saving less That would have come to an end anyway and now Brexit seems to be making them more cautious There is also a lack of clarity of the context in which the government will have to budgetGerard Lyons chief economic strategist NetwealthThe outlook for the economy depends upon the interactions between the fundamentals policy and confidence Brexit uncertainty will impact via policy and confidence The economy could easily come to a standstill in the early months as political uncertainty overshadows all else As raw politics may dominate in early 2019 one has to keep options open regarding Brexit and economic policyThe most likely Brexit scenarios appear to be either an acceptance of the prime ministers withdrawal agreement most probably with a change to the backstop for parliament to accept it Indeed as the possibility of no deal becomes more likely then there may be an increased likelihood of the EU offering an enhanced offer to the UK Here there would be a transition agreement which while not removing uncertainty would ease the pace of adjustment or a managed no deal or exit on WTO terms which would likely involve agreement during the first quarter on sector specific deals While uncertainty would likely persist until the end of March this might be alleviated sooner if it was clear the UK and EU were preparing post March to reach a free trade agreement as I think they would In the event of a managed no deal one should expect plans to be in place for monetary and fiscal stimulus in the second quarter While increased preparation in the first quarter for a managed no deal may trigger some increased business spending it is hard to quantify fully this likely impact and it is likely to be offset by a delay in other spending plans Likewise it is hard to forecast the impact of any uncertainty particularly as that should keep sterling competitive and encourage the Bank of England to have a bias towards easier policy although in all likelihood they will likely keep policy on hold in the first quarter It is not just Brexit uncertainty but the currently negative mood overhanging global financial markets that may weigh on spending and investment plans leading to a deferment of these Stephen Machin professor LSEMuch of the uncertainty has already been factored in but more recent events and extra uncertainty associated with that may magnify the effects we have already seen upward pressure on price inflation firms cutting back on intangibles like worker training and overtime and associated negative effects on firm productivityChris Martin professor Bath universityA lot the effects will be felt throughout next yearCostas Milas professor of finance University of LiverpoolTo be plain quite badly Let me elaborate Mrs May has struck a deal with our EU partners which is a compromise Brexiters are moaning that the deal is too bad for us and urge Mrs May to negotiate a much better deal Are they kidding themselves and the rest of us If the deal is too bad for us it should be quite good for the rest of the EU With this in mind why on earth would EU leaders come back to the negotiating table when they have already won Rational behaviour is also quite thin when it comes to parliament Some are dreaming of a free vote which will allow our parliament to choose amongmultiple solutions and guide the government towards the most sensible one Add to all of the above the prospect of conditional referenda in Latin or referendums in English Notice that we cannot even agree on what the plural of referendum is How on earth will we then be able to deal withmultiple choice referendum questions as many suggest Sadly all of the above point to a unique conclusion we are sleepwalking towards a nodeal Brexit which will hit our economy badlyDavid Miles professor Imperial CollegeThe short run impact in holding back some spending may be significant But its impact beyond a couple of quarters is itself likely to be smallAllan Monks UK economist JPMorganThe intensification in Brexit uncertainty is affecting both household and business confidence Businesses have already cut back their investment sharply at a time when the estimated net rate of return on investment remains high by the standards of the past decade The deterioration in household expectations of their personal finances is striking given the strengthening in their real income growth recently from lower inflation higher wages and job growth and suggests fears of no deal are pulling down confidenceAndrew Mountford professor Royal HollowayEconomic theory as well as common sense suggests that more uncertainty will lead to delays in investment decisions as well the incurring of additional costs insurance to mitigate this uncertainty Both these effects will be operating in the first quarter of 2019Jacob Nell chief UK economist Morgan StanleyWe expect an endgame slowdown and forecast weak GDP growth of 01 per cent in both Q4 2018 and Q1 2019 This reflects our view that the lack of political consensus in the UK on Europe mirrored in the lack of a parliamentary majority for a particular course of action on Brexit would lead to a protracted period of elevated political uncertainty in the Brexit endgame which would deter investment and slow consumptionRain NewtonSmith chief economist CBIIt all depends what happens in January If the withdrawal agreement is successfully ratified then some of the nearterm uncertainty will lift and firms will be able to start investing again But investment growth will be subdued as it will take time for clarity on the postBrexit UKEU trading relationship to emerge But if as we approach the end of March a no deal looks likely well start to see a big impact on the economy Firms are already having to put contingency plans in place for a nodeal Brexit and more of these plans would turn into reality with jobs and investment in the UK lost Over the longerterm what matters is the relationship we will have with our most important trading partner the EU If we have more trading frictions with our nearest neighbour this will lower our growth and productivity In any event with uncertainty looming over the UK economy were likely to get off to a rocky start in 2019Charles Nolan professor Glasgow universityAs things stand Brexitrelated uncertainty looks set to dominate more than just the first quarter of 2019 Rather than Brexit being a moreorless determinate period of elevated uncertainty it has become essentially open endedAndrew Oswald professor Warwick universityProbably a fair amount Further stockpiling can be expected Land prices may well rise near port areas to allow lorry parking Falls in stock markets and generalised uncertainty about jobs and incomes will probably lead to consumers holding back on major purchasing decisionsDavid Owen managing director and chief European economist JefferiesA lot Clearly much will depend on what happens with the meaningful vote and whether the Labour leadership comes off the fence and calls for a second referendum but one cannot rule out the case that Theresa May continues to take it to the wire with uncertainty spiking More companies could be triggering contingency plans which are then not reversed including moving some of their businesses to the continent other companies will be building inventories other decisions could be on hold It should also be remembered that if Theresa May wins the meaningful vote on perhaps the second attempt it still needs to be enshrined into UK law requiring further debate and amendment Markets are likely to be particularly volatile with confusion rifeTej Parikh senior economist Institute of DirectorsEconomic growth is already expected to have slowed markedly under the weight of uncertainty in the final months of 2018 and now businesses who had hoped to start the new year with investments new hires and product launches are likely to put them on hold which continue to drag on the economyAnn Pettifor director Policy Research in Macroeconomics The main effect of Brexit to date is to depress business investment This will undoubtedly continue to stagnate or fall Given a slowing global and European economic context the UK will continue to lag behind comparator economies If it becomes clear in Q1 that we are heading towards a chaotic Brexit then consumer and business confidence will obviously slump and will continue furtherJohn Philpott The Jobs EconomistUntil the precise Brexit trajectory becomes clear net business investment and private sector net hiring will be weak Consumers will also remain cautious If uncertainty persists down to the wire of 29 March economic growth is likely to stagnate in the first quarterKallum Pickering senior economist BerenbergDespite the heightened uncertainty real GDP growth is likely to remain stable in Q1 at roughly the Q4 rate of 0304 per cent quarteronquarter While the risk of hard Brexit is likely to weigh on investment the same risk will probably lead to higher stockpiling by firms and households boosting consumption and production These two trends will roughly offset one anotherChristopher Pissarides Professor LSEThere will be a moderate increase of uncertaintyrelated behaviour over present levels which are already largeJonathan Portes professor of economics and public policy Kings College LondonBrexitrelated uncertainty has already affected the economy with essentially no growth during the past few months we may already be in recession I would expect absent a speedy resolution which seems unlikely the impacts to spread from large businesses to consumers and business more generallyVicky Pryce chief economic adviser Centre for Economics and Business ResearchQuite significantly Clearly the outcome of the vote on the withdrawal deal in early January assuming this time it goes ahead will be important but if it fails to get parliament backing it will throw many more uncertainties into the mix The past year has seen Brexit uncertainty mentioned increasingly as one of the main reasons for reduced optimism and depressed demand in many sectors from services to car manufacturing even now to consumer pessimism which has fallen to the lowest in five years despite record employment Business investment fell in each of the first three quarters of 2018 manufacturing was in recession in the first half and has shown only a small and intermittent improvement since and confidence by the sector is at its lowest for decades despite the pounds weakness It is hard to see how sentiment will turn If the withdrawal deal is voted through then business can at least expect a period of calmness during the transition but so much will still be left unsettled and business and consumers will remain cautiousSonali Punhani UK economist Credit SuisseBrexit uncertainty is already having an impact on the UK economy Activity and optimism have slowed down to subdued levels and have caused companies and customers to cancel or postpone spending and investment decisions This is likely to continue in Q1 until there is clarity on the path of Brexit and even accelerate as we move closer to the deadline of 29 March 2019Ricardo Reis LSEIt depends on whether there is a meaningful vote in the Commons right at the start of January or not If we reach the end of January still without a clear sense of what the trade restrictions and regulatory framework facing firms in just three months will be then it is hard to see this not having a negative effect on the economy in the first quarter Right now there is a significant chance of a hard Brexit in four months time the outcome that almost everyone from politicians to economists from Brexiters to remainers thinks will be terrible for the economy Until that leaves the table it is hard to see too many firms willing to seriously investPhilip Rush founder and chief economist HeteronomicsOngoing uncertainty in the Brexit process necessitates an intensification of precautionary activity Some of this will require shifting spending abroad as part of contingency planning but there should be an offsetting effect in inventory accumulation Overall I doubt there will be a significant depressing effect on the headline data from uncertainty aloneYael Selfin chief economist KPMGBrexitrelated uncertainty in Q1 is likely to affect the UK economy in two opposite directions On the one hand business investment and households purchases of big items could be further postponed At the same time contingency measures are likely to be stepped up boosting activityPhilip Shaw chief economist InvestecAn obvious issue is that we still do not know which Brexit regime it is that we are heading towards In terms of the shortrun it is possible that the UK fails to enter a 21month implementation period after March and hurtle out of the EU without a deal Meanwhile the shape of Britains longerterm relationship with the EU remains as unclear as ever Our baseline view is that the government will avoid no deal and will begin to hammer out a trade framework during the spring But the risks of either a messy exit or an Article 50 extension which would prolong the uncertainty are growing It is easy to envisage Brexit related question marks weighing further on business investment and therefore the economy as a whole over the start of next yearAndrew Simms codirector New Weather InstituteIt is hard to overstate the potential impact of the Brexit bridgecollapse on not just the UK economy but its cultural climate and quality of community life A wave of disingenuous commentary has claimed that previous negative warnings were wrong because they havent happened yet On one hand rather obviously thats because it hasnt happened yet but of course there are clear discernible signs of damage

deserved a response Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editors Picks Brunelleschi had a plan take away his identity In revenge for his not coming this evening he said according to Antonio Manettis 15thcentury biography of the architect well make him believe that he has become someone else Grasso returned home from his workshop the next day to find his front door locked He knocked expecting his mother only to hear a voiceBrunelleschisthat sounded uncannily like his own The voice called itself Grasso and referred to him as Matteo a local craftsman Just then Donatello walked by Good evening Matteo are you looking for Grasso Hes just gone inside Baffled Grasso headed for the Piazza di San Giovanni to seek out friends elucidation reassurance Instead officials from the citys merchant court set upon him calling him Matteo and demanding he pay off his outstanding debts He spent the night in jail The next day the real Matteos brothers came along to settle his debts then carted him home for dinner Grasso was gaslit I am no longer Grasso and have become Matteo Valentin Groebner a historian uses the story of Il Grasso to illustrate his study of how people were identified in early modern Europe It reveals two fundamental principles of personal identity The first is that any individuals identity is contingent on the recognition of others The second is that anything like a modern life is rendered all but impossible when that recognition is not forthcoming or is suborned Put those two things together and you see why the provision and policing of identity is one of the foundations of the modern state and the lives lived in it A persons sense of who they are depends on many things and is not necessarily either stable or singular People can identify in many ways and often do so simultaneously Your correspondent will happily reveal that he is an immigrant never an expat but also a pukka Londoner and none dare say him nay Political and social cultureat least in the liberal Westhave matured to a degree where an increasing number of countries allow him to choose his pronouns and assert his gender unilaterally But a claim that his name is Leo Mirani that he was born in 1983 and that he is a legal alien resident in Britain holds little weight without documentary evidence in areas regulated by the state finance housing employment marriage In the 19th and 20th centuries the power to issue legal identity like the power to issue fiat money became a state monopoly When states do not properly apply this power people suffer In the poor world those without proof of identity may be cut off from food rations public housing and other government assistance That is why the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child lists the right to birth registration and to a name second only to the right to life and why the aim of a legal identity for all is included in the sustainable development goals the UN has set for 2030 The World Bank reckons that at least a billion people cannot produce a birth certificate often because the states involved do not care to issue them Being undocumented means being cut off from the modern economyor working in the shadows and risking exploitation Identity is a vitally important service for citizens if they are to fully participate in the economy and society The fact that this service depends on the state raises problems Identity like tokens of monetary value can be taken away by the state that issues it A hundred years before Indias government declared in 2016 that all 500 and 1000rupee notes would cease to be legal tender the Italian authorities invalidated all passports belonging to militaryage men with immediate effect causing confusion on a similar scale Being undocumented means being cut off from the economy or working in the shadows and risking exploitation The problem is rarely so obviously daft as in a recent case in Romania where a court refused to overturn a mans death certificate on the grounds that though incontestably alive he had appealed too late I have no income and because I am listed as dead I cant do anything he said Sometimes the oddities are simply inconvenient Zhang Ying one of this newspapers data journalists in China cannot make doctors appointments or file taxes online because the unusual character for her name Ying does not appear in the official database of standard Chinese characters Sometimes real harm is done For a worked example look no further than Britain Britons or at least those whose political voices are heard have for generations seen the idea of being asked for their papers by an organ of the state as disturbingly continental The identity services offered by the state are circumscribed appropriately Compulsory identity cards have only been issued during wartime efforts to reintroduce them have been repulsed In 2017 though the media started reporting on dozens of legal residents being harassed detained or in some cases deported because they could not prove their right to be in the country A hostile environment policy of making Britain unwelcoming to illegal immigrants had carried through to children of immigrants who came to Britain from the West Indies and elsewhere after the second world warthe Windrush generation so named after one of the ships on which they travelled Since the Home Office had disposed of old landing cards forms that documented the arrivals a generation of Britons risked becoming illegal aliens The response of many observers including liberal ones like this newspaper was to call for a national identity register But the fact that such registers are now a necessity does not mean that they are not also a worry The information revolution means that far more data than ever before can be associated with people entered in such registers a possibility being used liberallywhich in these matters risks meaning illiberallyby states of all sorts China and India are both developing elaborate systems not just to identify over a billion people each but to organise their lives This issue is exacerbated by another change to the world of identityonline authentication The power governments guard in the physical world has online been taken up by Facebook and Google Nine out of ten nonChinese websites that allow their users to log in with the credentials provided by another company use one or both of them The economic incentives of the internet mean that these systems like government bureaucracies associate identity with ever greater swathes of information built up by the databrokers who manage the flows of information between advertisers tech firms and consumer companies The firms which provide identity services have insight into the lives of their users as states have into the lives of their citizens This introduces new vulnerabilities The gaslighting of Il Grasso required that his friends know a great deal about the intimate details of his life Outside police states that level of detail was rarely accessible to 20thcentury bureaucracies Increasingly they now have the means to create such portraitsas a result so do bad actors within the system and criminals who break into it As the gap between physical selfasserted identity and remote informationbased identity has grown the risk of being known to and identifiable by people you have never met increases Again the analogy with money illuminates There are good reasons for society to have evolved from value stored in the weighable gold of Florentine ducats to the digital codes of bank databases But that does not mean the new system is in all ways more secure Data breaches are commonEquifax Yahoo and Marriott have all lost customer information So are attacks Mat Honan a journalist had his Google Twitter and Apple accounts hijacked by hackers who used loopholes in each platforms identity verification processes As Mr Honan put it every time you call Pizza Hut youre giving the 16yearold on the other end of the line all he needs to take over your entire digital life But information technology provides possible avenues for improvement too Identity in the states eyes is a marker of a relationship that determines what you owe it and it owes you New systems could allow the obligations and the identity to be unbundledfor each individual to be able to show that they deserved something without having to say who exactly they were Jeremy Bentham an English philosopher suggested in the 18th century that people should have a unique identifier based on their name and place and date of birth tattooed on their wrists He believed this would improve peoples daily transactions Who are you with whom I have to deal The answer to this important question would no longer be liable to evasion In future it may be possible to ask simply Do you have the qualities I seek in a counterparty to this deal and receive an answer you can trust from someone whose name you need not know But it may also be possible to meet people who know exactly who you are and what youve done without you wanting them to To do the things that states want to dobe that tax their own people fight other states or improve the human conditionrequires a particular way of seeing the world As James C Scott a political scientist suggests in his seminal work Seeing like a State How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition have Failed the premodern state was in many crucial respects particularly blind It knew precious little about its subjects their wealth their landholdings and yields their location their very identity It lacked anything like a detailed map of its terrain and its people The building blocks of a functioning society that people in the rich world mostly take for grantedpermanent surnames street numbers and addresses standard units of weights and measurementall came from attempts to draw such maps and thus make the world legible as Mr Scott put it to its states A map is a system of coordinates So is an identity It takes descriptors applicable across the population and uses them to specify an individual Hence the double sense of identity as something that people share and something which defines them as themselves In Middle French identit means the quality or condition of being the same think identical twins It was not until 1756 that the word came to be used to denote individuality For most people over most of history it has been the sameness that has mattered identity tended to be a group designation Sects ethnicities and religions distinguished themselves from others and signalled membership of their groups through dress and headgear Mostly this identification came from the group itself sometimes it was imposed on them As early as the eighth century Jews were required to wear distinctive clothing in the Islamic world a practice adopted by medieval Catholic Europe and revived more recently by the Nazis Most early states were able to operate with these broad identities by being pretty broadbrush themselves they dealt with intermediaries such as local chieftains village heads and holy men or through collective fines or punishment They had some need for specifics the Romans peculiarly adept at organised violence established the notion of a census so the state could keep tabs on young men of fighting age and call them up as necessary But states cared much more about land yields and ownership than they did about people per se Domesday Book through which William the Conqueror made legible the English lands he had invaded in 1066 was concerned almost entirely with primary landowners peasants are listed by first namea very vague form of identityalong with other assets such as land and mills This way of looking at the world lingered for centuries Louis XVI managed to escape from revolutionary Paris in 1791 because passports issued to nobility at the time listed their staff by description and nothing else Louis assumed the dress of a valet In this world surnamesqualifiers added to the name properthat denoted family were important almost exclusively when there was land or title to inherit The vast mass of the people made do with a single name which in a village is quite enough since everyone knows you anyway That said names were quite few As late as the 18thcentury 90 of Englands men were either Charles Edward Henry James John Richard or William William the Conqueror may not have been interested in the little people but they happily named sons after him When needed specificity could be added with a patronym or a professional description which if its possessor passed on his profession might run in the family Smith was the most common surname in England for centuries Johnson preserves a popular patronymic as does Wilson It was only in 15thcentury Florence that tax officials began to insist on a second name to help them see who was who imposing a surname on those who lacked one But away from rich cities and the seats of power things were slow to change It took until the 17th century for people in the remotest parts of Tuscany to acquire fixed last names The modern notion of statesanctioned identity can be dated to September 20 1792 From this day forth begins a new era in the history of the world as Goethe put it Admittedly Goethe was not referring to a decree on ltat civil civil statusmade on that day by the National Assembly He had in mind the Battle of Valmy at which the French revolutionary army imbued it is said with a new spirit of nationhood beat the Prussians who outnumbered and outgunned them But the creation of civil status was a watershed too It took the question of identity away from a hodgepodge of vouching for one another parish records and the like It changed the states attitude from that of previous censuses such as the one called for in the constitution of the United States which required only enumeration not identification It established the states direct and unique bureaucratic relationship with every citizen The 19th century saw the idea of such unique and authoritatively recorded relationships established as the primary form of identity across the metropolitan and colonial world This was in part a response to the increasingly anonymous milieu of the Industrial Revolutions cities where identity could be assumed and shucked off more easily than in smaller communities Part of this new state enforcement of identity was a legal prohibition on changing your name without seeking permission Another was the identity card France introduced them in Algeria in 1882 for vagrants in metropolitan France in 1912 and for foreigners in 1917 The identities of criminals were of particular interest In 1828 Prussia standardised the ways in which the police described people In 1885 France adopted Alphonse Bertillons anthropometric system for identifying prisoners by measuring bits of the body branding had been abolished in 1832 moving identity away from the social and legal world of names and heritage and into the measurable and purportedly objective world of anatomy The system was soon adopted around the world as was the standardised mugshot another idea of Bertillons If state records were correct your body no longer needed to be written on as Bentham had suggested in order to reveal definitively who you were The anatomical measure that came to rule the roost was the fingerprint simply taken easily reproduced purportedly uniqueand also remarkably present even when the identifiable body that had left it was gone The ability of the state to read the world was taken to a new level The fingerprint was just the start There exist today any number of unique identifiers The field of biometrics offers recognition by face gait retina ear and more There are official documents And there are also mobile phone numbers social network ID s smartphone device ID s constellations of browser cookies Records of each are largely created separately from each other and administered by divergent or competing interests within and outside the state When reconciled they can produce detailed portraits of the person they identify locating them according to all sorts of varied coordinates Two current attempts at such reconciliationone public one privatestand out for their efforts to make such things work across huge populations Indias Aadhaar ID project and Facebook They both show how the control of identity is evolving in the 21st century Neither is reassuring Like Aadhaar Facebook is a juggernaut dimly understood even by its own creators Aadhaar which means foundation is a 12digit number tied to a persons name gender address date of birth and the biometric information of ten fingerprints and two irises It exists to make every Indian no matter how poor or marginalised visible to the state Nandan Nilekani a software billionaire and the architect of the programme wrote in his 2015 book Rebooting India Making the pitch for the programme in a previous book Imagining India he argued that creating a national register of citizens assigning them a unique ID and linking them across a set of national databasescan have farreaching effects in delivering public services better and targeting services more accurately If you hear echoes of Jeremy Bentham and James L Scott in that you are not wrong Mr Nilekanis vision was of less fraud more efficiency greater transparency and a lot more inclusion Aadhaar was to bring hundreds of millions into the formal labour and financial markets In the eight years since the first number was issued to Ranjana Sonawane then a 30yearold housewife in a remote village in western India Aadhaar has achieved nearly universal coverage of Indias 13bn residents in part by being admirably flexible It requires no last names and the address can be as vague as behind the jamun tree It is nonbinary with respect to gender too But it is not as originally conceived voluntary By the summer of 2018 Aadhaar was required or encouraged by nearly every government agency and programme In one or more of Indias 29 states it had been mooted as a requirement for access to subsidised grain cooking gas free school lunches welfare payments government pensions public health care fertiliser subsidies scholarships fellowships and rehabilitation from sex trafficking to get a birth or death certificate buy railway tickets move large sums of money file taxes or buy and sell property People reported being asked for Aadhaar when trying to send mail at the post office The Reserve Bank of India ordered banks to link the number with accounts The department of telecoms required it for a mobile phone subscriptions Websites for arranging marriages started asking for it Amazon asked people for Aadhaar numbers to track lost packages The question of whether all this was constitutional was brought to the Supreme Court In September it ruled that it was and allowed its use in the administration of welfare payments subsidies and taxes in effect making it mandatory But it narrowed its use by the state and banned it for private companies That restriction may not last Arun Jaitley the finance minister has hinted that the government will pass new legislation to allow private use of the national ID Has Aadhaar made good on its promise to plug the holes in Indias leaky socialwelfare system cut corruption and ensure that the deserving get access to cheap grain and fuel No one knows When asked a former boss of the Unique Identity Authority of India  UIDAI  called his successor to ask if there had been any studies of savings There hadnt Aadhaar has in some cases cut off access to benefits for people who previously received them and were not obviously fraudulent Those who never got access in the first place have suffered too In February a woman gave birth outside a public hospital after being turned away for not having Aadhaar Rural workers guaranteed employment by the law have had wages delayed because of Aadhaars shoddy implementation Residents of Jagdamba Camp a slum in South Delhi say the complexity of the system for linking Aadhaar to new ration cards has resulted in family members being dropped off the list Sainaj a 55yearold housewife could not register her 29yearold daughter who is paralysed and unable to leave the house She no longer receives food benefits disability benefits or free medication Others complain about repeated often fruitless trips to the local ration office to reregister or link their documents eating into the days earnings Moreover the system is prone to leaks theft misuse and overuse No one knows for certain how much Aadhaarassociated data have been shared with whom but in January 2018 Rachna Khaira a reporter at the Tribune a newspaper bought a database with details on 1bn Indians for 500 rupees 7 Indias states each have their own copies and layers of subcontractors have access to them A system designed to prevent fraud has given rise to a whole new economy of fraudulent activitysuch as the sale of fingerprints Mr Scott identifies four factors that are necessary for the failure of such schemes to improve the human condition an administrative imposition of order that is inflexible and leaves out a lot of details about things in an attempt to make them simpler an ideology that elevates science and technology above all else an authoritarian state and a prostrate civil society India fulfils the first two conditions and under the Hindu nationalism of Narendra Modi the prime minister it is worryingly close to meeting the third Journalists reporting on Aadhaars shortcomings have been intimidated by authorities When Ms Khaira bought that bootlegged billionperson database the UIDAI filed a criminal complaint against her In a country where both national parties stand accused of using voter lists to systematically target and murder minorities it is not paranoia to fear a government with access to a comprehensive database on every citizen India does however possess a noisy and determined civil society The Supreme Court ruling in September was the result of more than two dozen separate cases filed on legal technical constitutional and righttoprivacy grounds by concerned citizens And the courts ruling has acted as a check on the schemes everexpanding scope and limited the transfer of power from the identified to the identifiers The same cannot be said of Facebook de facto identity provider of the nonChinese parts of the internet It is not just that nearly 23bn people use the service at least once a month all identified by what seems to be a real name all not only providing portraits of themselves but also helpfully linking themselves to their friends and interests not to mention identifying pictures of each other Almost every website app and service now requires login details Many people find it convenient to use the same socialnetwork identity for many of these logins and Facebook as the biggest social network has 60 of this social login market Tinder a dating app used by tens of millions of people until recently required all its users to have a Facebook login relying on its identityverification procedures to keep creeps at bay But that also creates a single point of failure A data breach revealed in September compromised some 50m access tokens which are used as people log in to other sites On top of this Facebooks ad infrastructure uses cookies to track the activity of users and nonusers across the web it also has ways to track what they do in other apps and what they do offline When someone swipes a loyalty card in a supermarket the name address and email address are useful bits of information for the retailer to reconcile with Facebooks records and it does so This lets it build detailedif not always accurateprofiles Its policy of requiring real names links what it knows about online activity to offline identities Facebook has become the internets equivalent of Aadhaar a custodian of identities to which all other data that people might be interested in can be linked Like Aadhaar Facebook is a juggernaut dimly understood even by its own creators Its complexity makes it difficult to foresee problems and its size makes it impossible to control Facebook has so far proved reluctant to selfregulate to any serious extent Despite two years of negative publicity and fresh scandals about data misuse emerging nearly every week it is stuck reacting to them pretty much piecemeal Some argue that users can simply vote with their feet but there are no signs of that yet It is not so much that it is hardthough it is for many It is that most people dont really seem to care Many of us in this room think we know how we use digital identity But the truth is I am baffled most of the time I just click OK said Adam Cooper who helped set up the British governments online identity system Verify and now works at ID 2020 an organisation working to bring identity to the undocumented Mr Cooper was talking to a room full of specialists at a panel discussion in the House of Lords The mood was gloomy Steve Gtz another panelist started his remarks by apologising because Im from Silicon Valley and we have created many of the problems were trying to solve today A similar sentiment pervaded an identity conference in Marseille in September The internet was built without identity management laments Thorsten Niebuhr of WedaCon a German firm that does just that Most of us in the industry are aware of the problem Weve been talking about it for at least a decade There are standards but there is no coordinated effort to manage digital identity It is because of that omission that Facebook has been able to dominate online identity which for many of those at the meetings was problem enough But the lapse also represents an opportunity cost For most purposes the amount of information now linked to a digital identity be it a Facebook login an Aadhaar number or whatever is extraneous and open to abuse What a commercial or civic exchange requires is normally the ability to verify a fact about youyour age say or solvencyrather than to know who you are When your correspondent went to that discussion at the House of Lords the security guards did not need to know who he was though in a country with ID cards they probably would have asked for one They needed to know he was unarmed which was ascertained by other means With a good ID system such an approach could be freely applied to aspects of life much subtler than the presence or absence of weaponry It would be possible for people to verify facts about themselves without providing the opportunity for a panoramic snoop around their lives to give the coordinate on the map that is relevant to the question asked without giving the other coordinates needed to specify exactly who you are Yoti a Londonbased startup which wants to become the worlds trusted identity platform is one of many attempts to provide such a service Its system stores government ID documents and biometrics If a user wants to buy a bottle of wine at a supermarket selfcheckout and needs to prove their age they scan a QR code and take a selfie using Yotis app The retailer can be sure of their age but no one has seen their name or nationality Several startups are entering the market Many are looking to blockchains such as the one which underpins bitcoin and other distributedledger technologies to do for identity what cryptocurrencies claim to do for moneydisentangle it from the state Canadas SecureKey which uses a blockchain for triple blind privacy meaning neither the issuer of an ID the recipient nor SecureKey sees more than needed for authentication is backed by banks and telecom firms Omidyar Network an investment firm is pouring money into identity companies GSMA a trade group of mobilenetwork operators is promoting its own identity system along similar lines Governments and international organisations are interested Countries around the world look to Estonia as a standardbearer in issuing secure and useful eidentities Austrias e ID which makes it impossible to link identifiers across services is seen as a model of privacy But there have been disasters too Nigerias MasterCardbranded biometric ID system has been widely criticised Kenya is considering the collection of several forms of biometrics and DNA too in a programme that makes Indias look like a model of restraint A new Venezuelan ID is used to track voting Immigration authorities and thermostats would set their own thresholds of acceptability The need for secure online identities will become more urgent as the world digitises further Connected devices are steadily infiltrating homes Smart meters for utilities are becoming commonplace as are smart thermostats Voiceactivated speakers such as Amazons Echo are increasingly popular The median American household had at least five connected devices in 2017 That number may well double within a few years and no one can say at what level it will plateau All those devices need to be able to verify who is using them Nobody wants a hacker opening their garage door or adjusting the heating Passwords for every individual device are a nonstarter Largescale biometric scanning is inevitable If this all works with systems that endlessly check precisely who is doing what rather than simply that whoever is doing something has the right to be doing it privacy as it has been understood is over Identities which individuals can administer for themselves through a trusted nonstate third party or even a distributed ledgerselfsovereign identities as their advocates call them in a rather captain of my soul sort of wayoffer more benefits than just verification without undue disclosure State ID documents often say who you were as much as who you are selfsovereign ones could be bang uptodate And they could work probabilistically There is a 70 chance this is who it claims to be a machine would say Immigration authorities and thermostats would set their own thresholds of acceptability There are two big obstacles to developing such systems One is apathy People do not adopt new ID s unless there is a reason to do so States get around the problem by making it mandatory Private companies must offer more Microsoft introduced Passport a digital ID for the web two decades ago but it never took off There were not enough users or websites to sustain it Facebook became the internets identity provider by offering a range of other attractions The other problem is that few people have the patience to manage their own affairs even when given the choice People have for years talked about models of user control of data in the context of Facebook and Google Yet no real options have materialised Most people say they are concerned about the use of their personal data but are perfectly happy to give it up with very little incentive something academics call the privacy paradox It is a paradox that keeps Facebook in business It is fruitless to blame people for this irritating inconsistency It is the way people are Perhaps more fruitful is to take aim at tech entrepreneurs and those to whom they look for inspiration If enough of them were to take seriously the case for selfsovereign identitiesand thus forswear the advantages that conveniently identitytagged portraits of their customers bestowthey might provide an incentive for the development of such a system If it could be made easy and fun it might even be popular As much of the world risks being overidentified however remember those who remain underserved You do not have to travel to the poor world to find one of the billionplus people without proof of identity You can find them in Baltimore the biggest city in the American state with the highest median income For several mont

leadership magic For the 300000 people who work at GE a trip to Crotonville is an ardent desire and a treasured accomplishment This pilgrimage in August 2017 was different The stock price had been slumping and longtime CEO Jeff Immelt had just stepped down after a frustratingly middling 16year tenure The new boss John Flannery had started a monthslong review of every corner of Americas last great industrial conglomerate On that summer afternoon the auditorium buzzed with whispers of what was ahead No one doubted the 125yearold companys ability to rise again It always had Then Jeff Bornstein started talking The gruff 52yearold chief financial officer had lost out on the top job weeks earlier but had committed to staying on to help the new CEO navigate the companys complicated structure Bornstein launched into an exhortation Run the company like you own it Be the leaders General Electric bred you to be You should all be accountable for every prediction made and every target missed I love this company he said Then he stopped and took a breathdeep and racked He started again and stopped again Jeff Bornstein the sharkfishing nicotinegumchomping weightlifting CFO was crying A Maine native Bornstein had come to GE after college eventually serving as finance chief of the lending arm GE Capital where he helped stave off the worst damage of the financial crisis His rivals within the company found him blunt to a fault willing to chastise or demean in public and private He served as a counterbalance to Immelts relentless optimism and his finance chops brought him the respect of Wall Street If this guy was fighting back tears something must be seriously wrong In the first six months of 2017 GE had earned hardly any of the 12 billion in cash it projected for the

and it was far from over GE had defined and outlived the American Century deftly navigating the shoals of depression world war and the globalization of business Even when things were at their worst its belief in its history and its prowess made it feel titanic and impregnable And yet unsinkable GE was taking on water fast This article is based on scores of interviews with dozens of people directly involved in these events They include current and former board members senior executives and employees at GE headquarters and in its various business units as well as bankers and advisers employed by the company investors in its stock customers for its products and corporate analysts who evaluated its performance The reporting also reflects internal GE communications and documents

Thomas Alva Edisons ingenuity and John Pierpont Morgans audacity GE built the dynamos that generated the electricity the wires that carried it and the lightbulbs that burned it To keep the power and profits flowing day and night GE connected neighborhoods with streetcars and cities with locomotives It soon filled kitchens with ovens and toasters living rooms with radios and TVs bathrooms with curling irons and toothbrushes and laundry rooms with washers and dryers The modern GE was built by Jack Welch the youngest CEO and chairman in company history when he took over in 1981 He ran it for 20 years becoming the rare CEO who was also a household name praised for his strategic and operational mastery Welch short sharp and volatile had an intense glare and a reedy growl that betrayed his bluecollar Massachusetts roots He was obsessive about setting targets and hitting them A chemical engineer by training he once blew the roof off a GE factory He expressed disdain for GEs bureaucracy from his earliest days there and later earned the nickname Neutron Jack He eliminated some 100000 jobs in his early years as CEO and insisted that managers fire the bottom 10 of performers each year who failed to improve in a process that became known as rank and yank GEs financial results were so eyepopping that the strategy was imitated throughout American business Fix it close it or sell it was a favorite slogan Welch wanted to get out of any businesses where GE wasnt a market leader At its peak General Electric was the most valuable company in the US worth nearly 600 billion in August 2000 That year GEs third of a million employees operated 150 factories in the US and another 176 in 34 other countries Its pension plan covered 485000 people With nearly 10 billion shares outstanding GE was also among the most widely owned stocks The company paid dividends to more than 600000 accounts from individual investors to major mutual funds that served millions GE had moved in and out of businesses since 1892 airplane engines plastics cannons computers MRI machines oilfield drill bits waterdesalination units television shows movies credit cards and insurance The big machines were always GEs beating heart But it was a willingness to expand into growing businesses and shed weaker ones that helped make it the rare conglomerate to survive the mass extinction of its rivals The catalyst for GEs success during Welchs reign was that it worked more like a collection of businesses under the protection of a giant bank As the financial sector came to drive more of the US economy GE Capital the companys finance arm powered more of the companys growth At its height Capital accounted for more than half of GEs profits It rivaled the biggest banks in the country competed with Wall Street for the brightest MBAs and employed hundreds of bankers Photos GE employed hundreds of thousands of people A few of them reflect on their jobs and how the company changed GE Capital sucked in debt and spat out money Created in the first half of the last century to help people buy home appliances it now financed fastfood franchises power plants and suburban McMansions and leased out railroad tank cars office buildings and airliners The industrial spine of the company gave GE a AAA credit rating that allowed it to borrow money inexpensively giving it an advantage over banks which relied on deposits The cash flowed up to headquarters where it powered the development of new jet engines and dividends for shareholders Capital also gave General Electrics chief executives a handy deep bucket of financial spackle with which to smooth over the cracks in quarterly earnings reports and keep Wall Street happy Sometimes that meant peddling half a parking lot on the final day of a quarter or selling a part interest in a power plant only to purchase it back after the quarter closed Many Capital veterans relished their reputation as mavericks and cowboys especially in comparison to their staid Wall Street rivals They loved the story about Capitals thenCEO Gary Wendt renting a camper and driving across Eastern Europe in the early 1990s buying up still sleepy banks as the postCommunist era dawned The rest of the decade saw explosive growth helping drive Jack Welchs fame into orbit With shares trading above 150 in early 2000 Welch split the stock 3for1 It would prove to be a highwater mark GE shares retreated in his final year after a failed takeover of rival Honeywell and the popping of the dotcom bubble Still GE shares were trading at 40 times its earnings when Welch retired in 2001 more than double where it had historically And much of those profits were coming from deep within Capital not the companys factories Disaster hit immediately after Welch left The Sept 11 terrorist attacksfour days after his handpicked successor Jeff Immelt took overhammered GEs insurance businesses and grounded the airline industry Immelt began revamping the Welch portfolio selling off the plastics division and most of the insurance lines He didnt rein in the lending at Capital which accounted for 38 of GEs revenue in 2008 When the financial crisis hit Capital fell back to earth taking GEs share price and Immelt with it The stock closed as low as 666 in March 2009 General Electric was on the brink of collapse The market for shortterm loans the lifeblood of GE Capital had frozen and there was little in the way of deposits to fall back on The Federal Reserve stepped in to save it after an emergency plea from Immelt After that GE wasnt regarded like its fellow industrial companiesbig slowmoving businesses that could project demand for their hulking machines over decades Instead the neardeath experience taught investors to think of GE like a bank a stock

Merritt Parkway in Norwalk Conn They hovered in meetings demanding details on lending businesses that Capital staff worried the regulators didnt understand or respect Immelt gritted his teeth at the name of Caroline Frawley head of the Fed teams that patrolled the unit that spun out nearly half of GEs profits That woman he said at one point is not going to tell me how to run this company He wanted to be free to invest billions into developing a new jet engine without worrying about the government looking over his shoulder As the recovery slouched into the early part of this decade a handful of topranking executives huddled here and there always discreetly to discuss their most obvious problem GE couldnt live without GE Capital still so big it was essentially the nations seventh largest bank But investors couldnt live with GE Capital and its unshakable shadow of risk either What if the GE Jack Welch built didnt work any more GE might reap billions from selling Capitals businesses as well as the real estate mortgages and other assets it owned but that would create a gigantic tax bill More importantly the company would need a plan to replace the earnings Capital brought in each quarter Cracks in the performance of the companys industrial linesits power turbines jet engines locomotives and MRI machineswould now be plain to see some executives worried without Capitals cash to help cover the weak quarters and pay the sacrosanct dividend That dividend doling out billions of dollars to shareholders is one reason GE was owned by so many with about 43 of its shares held by individual investors It was hard to see how the puzzle pieces could be made to fit Immelt and Bornstein the CEO known as Big Jeff and the CFO as Little Jeff and a small group of trusted lieutenants kept meeting Increasingly Immelt worried about his legacy He often reminded people that he kept the ship afloat after Sept 11 and the financial crisis But he also joked that his ability to ride out in a blaze of glory ended the day Lehman Brothers went bankrupt in September 2008 Whittling away at Capital wasnt enough Immelt trapped in Welchs long shadow craved a bold move to shock his company out of the doldrums that had plagued his tenure It was time for GE to be reinvented again MEAL AND DEAL Jeff Immelt was on his way to the Winter Olympics in Russia in February 2014 when the GE jet made a stop in Paris for dinner He had an invitation from Patrick Kron his counterpart at the struggling French industrial conglomerate Alstom SA Kron was looking for a savior Alstom a maker of trains rail equipment power turbines and generators was veering toward insolvency signing up business at a loss just to keep money coming in the door The beleaguered CEO had dined already with the chief executive of GEs archrival Siemens AG In Immelt Kron found a man spoiling for a big deal Just a few months earlier the word had gone out to the merger teams embedded in each of GEs industrial units Headquarters wants your biggest targets Alstom was one of the expensive deals Immelt focused on as the two CEOs chatted into the night in Paris After dinner in France Immelt stopped in Helsinki to consider another target Wartsila a Finnish builder of marine engines oilandgas equipment and power plants Another potential deal dubbed Project Lion came from GEs oilandgas unit Still not long after the restaurant bill was paid momentum was building for a bid on Alstom The only question was how much Immelt would be willing to pay Number of acquisitions 90 deals 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 05 1995 15 10 2000 Number of acquisitions deals 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 15 1995 2000 05 10 Number of acquisitions deals 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 05 1995 2000 10 15 Number of acquisitions deals 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 05 15 95 2000 10 Some GE directors and advisers were wary Immelts determination to complete a blockbuster reflected his customary optimism a trait that had led him to overpay in the past and one the succession team warned the board about before it picked him as CEO Hardworking and affable Immelt was 6foot4 with a mane of graying hair swept back from the temples He moved easily through crowds and possessed the practiced eye contact of a politician He was quick to chuckle and usually had a joke to tell even if it often was one hed already told Former colleagues compared him to Bill Clinton because of his magnetic ability to hold the focus of a room He sounded like a leader He was a natural salesman Immelt an Ohio native who played football at Dartmouth came to GE out of Harvard Business School He changed jobs often working in the plastics division before eventually running the healthcare unit Immelt was 44 years old when he won a bruising and public succession contest set up by Welch beating out two men who would later lead Home Depot Chrysler 3M and Boeing Welch advised him to carve his own path and Immelts decision was to take a gentler tack Welch was known to put his arm around an executive who just missed his numbers tell him he loved him and if it happened again he was out Immelt could lean on executives and their underlings just as hard cajoling and challenging but he discouraged dissent by applauding optimistic news Welch the engineer was likely to quiz a manager about detailswhy are the numbers down at your plantwhere Immelt dealt in broader strokes He embraced his background in sales A presentation at any GE meeting was called a pitch and ideas for new businesses were imagination breakthroughs Decisions had to fit with the story of the company and where it was going Immelt was so confident in GEs managerial excellence that he projected a sunny vision for the companys future that didnt always match reality He was aware of the challenges but he wanted his people to feel like they were playing for a winning team That often left Immelt in the words of one GE insider trying to market himself out of a math problem For the month or so after the dinner with Kron a team of GE merger specialists set about trying to make the math for the Alstom deal work Executives at GE Power knew Alstom well having given it an appraising sniff two years earlier They found a company then too troubled to take a run at Alstom was in greater need of cash than the market understood had too many employees and French law made it too difficult to lay off workers and sell assets Alstoms problems hadnt gone away but now its stock was cheaper and Immelt saw the makings of a deal that fit perfectly with his vision for reshaping his company GE would essentially swap Capital the cash engine that no longer made sense for a new one that could churn out profits each quarter in the reliable way that industrial companies were supposed to At the time of GEs 2014 shareholder meeting in April Alstom executives flew to a hotel near the venue in Chicago to talk To the dismay of some involved GEs bid crept upward from the 30 a share that the power divisions deal team already believed was too high to roughly 34 or almost 47 Immelt and Kron met oneonone and the deal team realized the game was over The principals had shaken hands Immelt knew Alstom had its problems but hoped to show off the management prowess on which GE prided itself The French company had a large collection of power plants that GE would run more efficiently and a flabby global workforce that GE would slash News of the deal leaked hours after the shareholder meeting was over Valued at 17 billion the acquisition would be GEs largest ever and the first move in the onetwo combination that Immelt thought would revive his company and set his legacy THE PIVOT Jeff Immelt was all smiles when he took the stage for that Augusts annual Crotonville leadership summit His first PowerPoint slide was entitled GE Pivot Alstom promised tremendous upside with strong execution read another projected on the auditoriums big screen Unique amp historic opportunity at high returns In Immelts vision this was a chance to corner the market on lighting the unlit corners of the Earth He imagined crushing competitors for gasfired power turbines such as Germanys Siemens and Japans Mitsubishi and winning bids to build power plants across the Middle East Africa and South Asia In the present the deal made sense to other GE executives because they believed the company could squeeze more profit from the old coalfueled power plants Alstom operated in Europe and Asia The visions for the present and the future were both fundamentally flawed As GEs research department was preparing white papers heralding The Age of Gas the world was entering a multiyear decline in the demand for new gas power plants and for the electricity that made them profitable Opposition from the French governmentblindsided when news of the deal leaked in Aprilslowed completing it to a crawl GEs negotiating team continued to agree to more costly concessions demanded by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic as 2014 bled into 2015 Under pressure from the US Justice Department GE agreed it would get rid of an Alstom unit that serviced turbines made by competitors Bowing to the Europeans GE agreed to dump Alstoms stilldeveloping program to build a stateoftheart gas turbine equivalent to GEs flagship model That technology was transferred to Italys Ansaldo potentially opening the door to more serious competition since the company is 40 owned by the Chinese And European and Alstom officials stymied GEs attempts to review the companys order book a black box of immeasurable risk since the French company had been lowballing bids just to keep sales coming in By mid2015 the concessions threatened GEs logic for the acquisition The company hired litigators at one point ready to fight regulators or even to help extricate GE from the deal if Immelt and his top executives decided it no longer made sense A band of skeptics inside GE Power were hopeful the deal would collapse When advisers determined that the concessions to get the deal approved might have grown costly enough to trigger a provision allowing GE to back out some in the Power business quietly celebrated confiding in one another that they assumed management would abandon the deal But Immelt and his circle of closest advisers wanted it done That included Steve Bolze the man who ran it and hoped someday to run all of General Electric THE EXIT In the early spring of 2015 GE Capitals chief Keith Sherin strode into a colleagues office in the divisions Norwalk headquarters to share the companys most tightly held secret Were going to deSIFI the boss said That mystifying bit of regulatory jargon could only mean one thing They were selling GE Capital Immelts reinvention of GE was moving into its next phase In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis Capital was deemed such a big player in the banking system that it was designated a Systemically Important Financial Institution and forced to accept the more intrusive regulation that Immelt so despised In the years since GE Capital had been shrinking slowly but not fast enough for investors Annual revenue in 2018

GE would sell 216 billion worth of financial assets real estate railcars mortgage holdings and lending operations that served midsize firms and provided venture capital Added to what it had already spun off 310 billion worth of Capitals business would be chopped up and spread across the American financial system That would leave a 100 billion stub that included the planeleasing unit and some industrial leasing operations meant to boost GEs power and oilandgas businesses Once complete less than 10 of GEs total earnings would come from the finance engine that Jack Welch had built It struck some within Capital as an overcorrection to both the markets and skeptical regulators at the Fed Some worried how the company would manage once most of GE Capital was gone What are we going to do about the cash the second Capital executive asked after Sherin broke the news Well work it out Sherin said thinking ahead to the thousands of hours and hundreds of people it would take to pull off Immelt had picked Sherin who had been the finance chief of the entire company to run Capital after the financial crisis 175 million shares Stock buybacks 150 Source SEC filings 125 100 75 50 25 0 18

earnings The company made the plan public on April 10 almost one year after the Alstom deal leaked to the press and decided to act fast to sell most of the business Despite a few private misgivings in Norwalk the plan was widely supported by other GE employees the board and more importantly investors Billionaire Nelson Peltz who runs Trian Fund Management an activist investment firm feared by executives of struggling companies called to congratulate Immelt on the pivot right after the announcement In response the GE boss told Peltz Wed love to have you in the stock CRACKS IN POWER Things were beginning to come together for Jeff Immelt as 2015 wore on That summer he sat behind a desk in the auditorium in Crotonville watching Steve Bolze cue up PowerPoint slides as part of the Growth Playbook a grueling annual examination of GEs eight business leaders At the event GE would hammer out targets for sales and profit setting the underlying assumptions for the financial estimates it would give investors It had been a few months since the plan to sell off GE Capital had been announced and Bolze the head of GE Power was inching toward completion of the Alstom deal Already the chief of GEs largest business by sales Bolze 52 years old and squarejawed was in the race to succeed Immelt and he was about to add a huge new global portfolio of power plants and thousands of workers to his fiefdom Moving through the slides Bolze came to the proposed annual sales growth rate of the power business 5 There was ample reason for skepticism Power had been struggling to meet targets and its sales hadnt grown that quickly in years Global investment in new gasfired power plants was slowing Energy efficiency was on the rise That meant future revenue from the highly profitable service contracts GE had signed was likely to fall or at least to grow less quickly Global gross domestic product a reliable proxy for the power market was below 4 It was a rosy assumption that cried out for interrogation the very point of the formal review As the room watched Immelt gave the desk in front of him a confident slap Great next page he said Immelt could be tough on executives in his own way in these briefings but it wasnt usually for being too optimistic Wheres the guy I used to know he would ask an underling who told him Immelts targets couldnt be hit When the mood soured the tone changed Your people Immelt would say dont want it bad enough So they stretched This was particularly true in Power after the Alstom deal closed in November 2015 Immelt pushed for market share at all costs which led to less than lucrative deals They also used financing from the stub of GE Capital to help prop up customer demand Already facing a slowdown in equipment sales and competition from renewable energy managers in Power struggled to mesh their operations with Alstoms the largest effort of its kind in GE history Throughout 2016 teams inside Power combed through the portfolio of service contracts each representing payments from power generators to maintain the turbines GE had sold them By design those contracts were malleable A technological innovation that improved the performance of a turbine blade or lengthened the number of hours between maintenance outages had to be accounted for The GE teams started offering discounted turbine upgrades to customers in exchange for extending the length of contracts to as far out as 2050 Executives scoured existing contracts for ways to change underlying assumptions such as the frequency of overhauls to boost their profitability GE Power even sold its receivablesthe bills its customers owed over timeto GE Capital to generate shortterm cash flow The unit gave customers discounts on their service contracts lowering their overall value in exchange for renegotiations that let the company bill the customers sooner The accounting maneuvers were legal if aggressive GE executives assured one another But it also meant that the profits were mostly on paper Rarely was a new dollar of profit flowing in the door Bolzes team was operating in a tradition that stretched at least as far back as the glory days of Jack Welch but the scale of the aggressive contract accounting was far bigger Worry was starting to grow inside Power by the end of 2016 Managements expectations about the sales growth and profit they should be able to hit didnt reflect the dim reality of the market team members told Bolze and Paul McElhinney the head of the unit that administered the service contracts The complaints were common among lowerlevel executives but when raised to leaders like McElhinney they were stopped cold Steves our guy McElhinney said in one meeting If Bolze was elevated to CEO those behind him in Power would rise too Get on board he said We have to make the numbers ENTER TRIAN The seed Jeff Immelt sowed with his invitation to Nelson Peltz bore fruit in the fall of 2015 Trian Fund Management disclosed it had been secretly buying up GE shares amassing a stake worth 25 billion that made it one of GEs 10 largest shareholders Some outsiders saw Immelt inviting in a disruptive investor like Peltz as a sign of confidence but it was also a defensive strategy Other activists were circling GE Activist investors are usually bad news for managers The pools of shares they control provide a fulcrum for prying loose board seats management changes and the sale of businesses Trian wasnt calling for a breakup or CEO change though as it had at lumbering companies including DuPont and Kraft It wasnt even seeking a seat on GEs board whose 18 highpowered members were loyal to Immelt as it had at Family Dollar IngersollRand Mondelez International and PepsiCo Rather the influential hedge fund was coming forward with what amounted to a highprofile endorsement of Immelts strategy Trians cofounders Peltz and his soninlaw Ed Garden took care to say this was a partnership with GE and its brass The duo traveled to GEs Fairfield headquarters on a Sunday afternoon to explain their thinking They sat alongside Immelt and Jeff Bornstein the GE chief financial officer under oils and watercolors many of them the

recover,https://www.ft.com/content/30e46fec-0210-11e9-9d01-cd4d49afbbe3,2018-12-17 18:45:08,Asos described Mondays profit warning as a bump in the road But investors who saw the shares crash by almost 40 per cent experienced severe whiplash The severity of the slowdown at the fast fashion retailer whose market value peaked at 64bn in March has raised questions about the confidence of Europes millennial consumers and the future of one of the UKs rare ecommerce success stories Shares in the company plummeted to a fouryear low after Asos revealed in an unscheduled trading update that sales growth would be slower than expected and that profit margins would fall from 4 per cent to 2 per cent as it cuts prices and spends more on marketing Analysts slashed their profit forecasts for this year by up to threefifths The fall is the most serious recent setback for a company that started 18 years ago copying the clothes that celebrities wore hence the original name As Seen on Screen Asos has had to cut prices sharply in its home market to maintain sales growth even at a lower pace Customers switched to cheaper items and spent less Average basket size is up 3 per cent Average basket value is down 6 per cent Those are trends Ive not seen for the best part of nine years said chief executive Nick Beighton on a conference call Suzy Ross a consultant at Accenture said The whole of fashion retail both online and offline has just become so promotional It is also much more competitive When Asos floated on Londons junior market in 2001 at 20p a share it was venturing back into a marketplace few thought was viable Boocom an early online fashion retailer had gone bust barely a year earlier Consumers surfed basic websites with dialup internet services Today roughly a quarter of all fashion sales are made online often via mobile devices Domestic competitors such as Boohoo and Missguided are growing rapidly and established retailers have moved online this year Nexts online sales exceeded its sales from stores for the first time Asoss worldwide revenues of 24bn are bigger than those of Sir Philip Greens Arcadia empire but size has brought complexity and growing pain Flagging consumer sentiment and heavy discounting in the UK was only one reason for the warning In Australia a market the group entered in 2011 Asos held off Black Friday promotions as the event has traditionally not had the impact seen in the northern hemisphere Germany and France which between them account for threefifths of Asoss European revenues were also weak Mr Beighton a former finance director at discount retailer Matalan who succeeded founder Nick Robertson as chief executive of Asos in 2015 said it was hard to pin down why sentiment had worsened in those countries Asked whether the group would have to rethink its Black Friday strategy Mr Beighton said The benefit of hindsight is two weeks old We need to have a good think about what we do going forward The share prices of other panEuropean retailers also bear the scars of heavy discounting HampM stock fell on Monday after the Swedish fashion group boosted sales only by cutting prices Spains Inditex the owner of Zara and Pull amp Bear maintained greater price discipline but may not now achieve its fullyear sales forecast Germanys Zalando a key Asos rival warned on profits earlier this year but said it would not change its current guidance The UKs Boohoo which targets younger consumers with cheaper clothes also rushed out a statement saying sales had been in line with its expectations Neither assurance was enough to prevent a doubledigit percentage fall in Asoss wake Asos has been a market darling for much of its existence At one point in 2014 its shares were valued at more than 100 times forecast profits and before Monday 18 of the 25 analysts who follow the stock still rated it a buy Bestseller the privatelyowned Danish group that built up a 29 per cent stake in Asos in 2010 and is still its biggest shareholder also remains supportive despite selling some shares this year But there are doubters too about 14 per cent of the free float now is on loan to shortsellers according to Markit data At the start of the year it was less than 1 per cent Even before Mondays fall Asos shares were down more than 40 per cent from their March highs Michelle Wilson analyst at Berenberg attributes this largely to negative sentiment towards the UK which still accounts for a third of the groups operating profit but others think that investors are becoming more wary of the investment needed to maintain the growth rate Asos was planning to spend up to 250m a year on logistics and technology for the next few years that has now been scaled back to 200m The challenge is to convert revenue growth into sustainable profit growth said Ms Ross Our ambitions have not changed Macro trends are challenging but that will not stop us building the business that our customers want and that we want Nick Beighton Asos chief executive The companys history has not been without adversity In 2005 an explosion at an oil terminal next to its warehouse halted business for six weeks while the groups distribution centres in Barnsley and Germany have also been damaged by fires And Asos has downgraded margin guidance before in 2014 when high levels of promotional activity and a strong pound were the culprits At the time Mr Beighton predicted that margins would recover but not to the 7 per cent levels previously forecast They have remained at about 4 per cent ever since This time he is adamant they will bounce back I am confident that 2 per cent is a low point I have every expectation that margins will recover and may even exceed 4 per cent he said Kate Calvert an analyst at Investec and one of the few to recommend selling the shares is not so sure I think margins will recover but perhaps not to 4 per cent she said citing the growing proportion of thirdparty brands now sold on Asos These are less profitable than ownbrand merchandise but help drive sales and customer numbers But Mr Beighton was adamant that poor current trading did not change the groups longterm aspirations which are to increase annual revenues to 4bn and possibly more He added that costs associated with the disruptive and risky process of moving to newer bigger warehouses in Europe and the US would start to fall away in the second half Our ambitions have not changed Macro trends are challenging but that will not stop us building the business that our customers want and that we want

decided in 2009 it was time for a makeover Known over hundreds of years for producing delicate stones for arts and crafts the city had few modern industries apart from consumer appliances So officials decided to lop the top off the surrounding hills and build a 134 sq km industrial park focused on fuel cells a rival technology to internal combustion engines and electric batteriesAttracted by generous government subsidies a whole suite of companies covering the supply chain have now set up in the park which is producing hundreds of buses and small trucks using fuel cells that run on hydrogen gas So successful has it been that local officials now plan to flatten two more hills to create a neighbouring vehicle manufacturing plant and a chemicals facility When we moved here it was all barren hills says Frank Ma chairman of Guangdong Nation Synergy Hydrogen Power Technology walking along a line of bright blue fuel cell buses Your first impression of the area is that this is not the kind of place to do this kind of manufacturing But this is a special kind of industry in China The Yunfu park is the epitome of Chinas powerful industrial policy which is designed to use generous subsidies to develop and dominate emerging industries critical to the Made in China 2025 shift to highend manufacturing Beijing has spent an estimated 588bn subsidising its electric car industry over the past decade according to the USbased Center for Strategic and International Studies creating the worlds largest market for electric cars as well as a dominant position in batteries surpassing Japan and South Korea Subsidies have also helped propel Chinese solar makers into the ranks of the worlds largest producers overtaking competitors in the US and Europe A hydrogen fuel cell bus in Zhangjiakou northern Hebei provinceNow Beijing hopes to do the same for fuel cells which along with electric vehicles could help decarbonise the entire transportation fleet and reduce Chinas vast reliance on imported oil While fuel cells are unlikely to compete with batteries for small passenger cars because of the latters continued reduction in costs they could play a role in larger vehicles such as trucks and buses as well as in ships and trains If you look at what China did in solar in wind and in battery electric vehicles the subsidy tap was opened and it brought a lot of capital and companies to these new markets which resulted in China being the leader in all three of these segments says Randy MacEwen chief executive of Canadas Ballard Power one of the worlds largest fuel cell manufacturers We expect to see something similar with the fuel cell industry Chinas rush into fuel cells could be an expensive gamble however The vehicles need to be able to compete without subsidies just as batteries are becoming ever cheaper quicker to charge and able to hold more energy for the same amount of weight Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has dismissed fuel cells and hydrogen as mindbogglingly stupid The drive for volumeThe power of Chinas subsidy machine can be seen in the southern city of Shenzhen which grew from a fishing village along the Sham Chun river that separates the mainland from Hong Kong into one of its most vibrant cities and home to some of its largest technology companies Almost the entire taxi fleet uses electric cars made by hometown producer BYD the worlds largest electric car manufacturer that is backed by Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway The buses are also all electric Almost half of all battery and plugin hybrid vehicles sold this year will be sold in China Thanks to government rules that restricted domestic car companies from buying batteries from foreign producers Chinese battery maker CATL has become the worlds largest producer overtaking rivals LG Chem and Panasonic Based in Ningde in southeastern Fujian province CATL this year signed deals to sell batteries to BMW and Daimler and announced plans to build a factory in Germany Just as it was in batteries five years ago China is a laggard in fuel cells behind Japan and South Korea as well as the US and Europe Toyota has consistently bet on the technology and launched its first fuel cell car the Mirai in late 2014 It sells for about 65000 Hyundais Nexo fuel cell model goes on sale this year for a similar priceCATL the Chinese leader in electric battery production  ReutersTo overcome that laggard status Chinese companies last year began a concerted effort to acquire and integrate foreign technology In May BYD announced it was working with the US Hybrid Corporation on a hydrogenpowered fuel cell bus to run in Honolulu airport And in November Weichai Power Chinas largest stateowned diesel engine maker spent 184m on a 20 per cent stake in Ballard This month Weichai also paid 48m for a 20 per cent stake in UKbased fuel cell maker Ceres Power Phil Caldwell Ceres chief executive says the size of the Chinese market was too big for his company to ignore The company plans to transfer its technology to Weichai and jointly invest in a manufacturing facility in eastern Shandong province The fuel cells will initially run on buses using compressed natural gas before the hydrogen infrastructure is built he says While we talk a lot about these technologies in Europe the Chinese government is actually pushing ahead Mr Caldwell says They can create the market and create the demand and drive these technologies down the cost curve Ballard says its joint venture with Weichai will aim to make at least 2000 fuel cells a year for commercial vehicles by 2021 the largest planned deployment to date The company says the total cost for customers to buy and operate a fuel cell bus will be the same as for a batterydriven vehicle by 2020 If you look at the costs were currently at a premium compared to battery electric vehicles says Mr MacEwen What hasnt happened yet in the fuel cell market is the power of volume China is a market that has proven that with subsidies they will drive production capacity and volume and see significant cost reductions Making 2m vehiclesBenny Oeyen a former executive for General Motors in Shanghai stands next to a fuel

leads the way with 4500 source International Energy Agency1mBeijings target for fuel cell vehicles on the road by 2030 The US target for that year is 800000 IEAThe money has helped China reach its annual target of 5000 fuel cell vehicles two years early around the same number of vehicles as California Industry participants say China could hit a target of 2m fuel cell vehicles by 2030 about 5 per cent of the total vehicle fleet Under the current scheme manufacturers of fuel cell vehicles are guaranteed to make a profit They can receive as much as 30000 from the central government per vehicle provided it is driven at least 20000km and meets minimum power requirements They can also receive a local government subsidy that varies by region With the current subsidies the producer of the fuel cell bus is making money from day one says Mark Sun head of marketing in Asia for Anglo American Platinum which is looking to boost demand for platinum through its use in fuel cells The subsidies have prompted a host of Chinese companies to start producing fuel cell vehicles including the countrys largest car manufacturer SAIC Motor and its largest electric bus maker Yutong Bus Yu Yi head of fuel cell research at SAIC says that when the company reaches a target of 10000 fuel cell vehicles the costs can be reduced substantially Stateowned companies have also started to build hydrogen refuelling stations with China Energy the countrys largest power company building one of the countrys biggest in the city of Rugao in eastern Jiangsu province The price of hydrogen is also heavily subsidised often making it cheaper than diesel Metal mattersFuel cells have a number of advantages for China They can help reduce the countrys reliance on imported energy as well as raw materials While lithiumion batteries require a host of metals such as cobalt lithium and nickel most fuel cells only require platinum of which there is an abundant supply as a catalyst at a level of around 05 to 06 grammes per kilowattIn terms of resource adequacy its a lot easier to see how you do it for fuel cells than for lithiumion batteries says Paul Gait an analyst at Bernstein If you go to the northern rim of the Bushveld in South Africa theres enough platinum to electrify the entire auto fleet China may also have a solution for being selfsufficient in hydrogen While most hydrogen is created from fossil fuels such as methane and used in the refining and chemical industries another method is to produce it using electricity to split water a process known as electrolysis This process is not an efficient use of energy but it makes sense when the cost of electricity is free Beijings huge investment in renewable energy over the past decade has caused a lot of electricity to be wasted since intermittent wind and solar power cannot be properly integrated into the grid China can use some of that wasted energy to generate hydrogen cheaply says Nick Ni general manager of Nantong Angstrom RenewableIt is estimated that around 150 gigawatts of renewable energy generating capacity is wasted in China every year because it cannot be integrated into the grid That could be used to power 18m passenger cars says Ju Wang deputy secretarygeneral of the International Hydrogen Fuel Cell Association China does not need to worry about hydrogen supply Despite this optimism fuel cells will face fierce competition from batteries given the amount of money that is going into that sector The global battery market is expected to increase 10fold by midcentury to 500bn according to Bernstein Research with costs expected to fall to parity with petrol engines by 2023 That is without any government subsidy Carmakers from Tesla to Daimler have also launched electric trucks that will compete with fuel cells It gets more difficult for fuel cells its not a matter of catchup its catching up with something thats moving ahead of you all the time says Peter Harrop chairman of consultancy IDTechEx China is backing all horses just in case Sceptics also warn that Chinas push into fuel cells could end up repeating its experience with electric cars where government spending has created huge amounts of production without making sure there is real demand There are more than 100 domestic electric vehicle makers in the Chinese market Can we identify electric car and fuel cell producers that will survive the inevitable consolidation At some point there will be a war of attrition and Im not clear how they are going to go about that says Scott Kennedy a senior adviser at CSIS Mr Ma in Yunfu is hesitant when asked if he can survive without subsidies Subsidy dependence is hard to get rid of he says Adding that if the whole experiment fails the best fuelcell vehicles are still scrap metal But he insists that once his company can produce more than 100000 fuel cells stacks a year up from the current 2000 its buses should be competitive against batterypowered rivals I said to the Guangdong government if you can purchase 100000 vehicles I can give you a price 30 per cent lower than electric vehicles Mr Ma says Our target from the first day was to survive beyond government subsidy and support Our goal is to keep costs down and completely commercialiseThe government has given a promise to the world that we have to reduce pollution he adds
