184,185,Grocery Giant's Boss Hands Christmas Gift to His Enemies,Tesco's ho-hum trading gives Booker shareholders even more power to demand Dave Lewis pays up to acquire the company.,https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2018-01-11/tesco-s-ho-hum-christmas-makes-it-need-booker-even-more,2018-01-11 09:47:42,Tesco Plc had a good Christmas The trouble is it needed a great one Chief Executive Officer Dave Lewis is trying to convince his investors to back the companys 39 billion pound 53 billion purchase of Booker Plc Some of Tescos biggest shareholders have protested that the deal is a distraction from the supermarkets recovery which is still only in its early days A knockout Christmas would have banished any doubts and paved the way for the deal to sail through shareholder votes at the end of February Tesco didnt deliver that Instead its third quarter UK same store sales were a touch below the Bloomberg consensus It also missed expectations over the six weeks to Jan 6 when UK samestore sales rose 19 percent compared with the Bloomberg consensus for a 28 percent increase Source Company reports Bloomberg Intelligence Lewis blamed this on disruption from the slide of Palmer amp Harvey which delivered tobacco and some food items to Tesco stores into administration The company estimates this hurt samestore sales by about 05 percentage point Even taking this into account sales growth is still below consensus Tesco said the Christmas performance had been very strong on food and fresh food in particular But this didnt stop its share price falling more than 45 percent Unexpected Item In the Bagging Area The supermarkets shareholders may argue that Lewis should set aside his Booker dreams and instead stick to mending the core business But the result arguably shows that Tesco needs Booker more than ever Britains grocers performed better than their nonfood counterparts over the holiday period But that was mainly driven by inflation which boosts the value of sales With Brexit related price increases due to ease as the year progresses that tailwind wont last forever The German discounters enjoyed phenomenal sales growth over Christmas Any supermarket boss who thinks their appeal is waning needs to think again Meanwhile Tescos rivals Wm Morrison Supermarkets Plc and WalMart Stores Incs Asda are getting their act together Against this backdrop Tesco needs Booker to bolster its buying power and deliver synergies With cost savings likely to be more than the 200 million pounds announced it could afford to be more generous Source Company reports Bloomberg The targets share price is trading above the value of Tescos offer Even taking into account the estimated 37 pence per share closing dividend that implies some Booker investors think Tesco will have to pay more As Gadfly has argued it would be worth Booker investors pushing for a higher price particularly as their threshold for approval is higher than the level for for Tesco shareholders Dave Lewis shouldnt let his Booker prize slip away  even if that means splashing the cash With assistance from Gadflys Chris Hughes This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners To contact the author of this story Andrea Felsted in London at afelstedbloombergnet To contact the editor responsible for this story Jennifer Ryan at jryan13bloombergnet

115,116,How Kohl’s Intends to Keep Its New Found Momentum,The chain must now prove its stellar holiday season was not a fluke.,http://fortune.com/2018/01/11/kohls-holidays/,2018-01-11 19:01:27,Kohls kss gave convincing proof this week that its efforts to get back on track are starting to pay off when it reported stellar holiday season sales numbers The retailer said on Monday that comparable sales had risen 69 in November and December outperforming the overall industry and close competitors like Macys m JC Penney jcp and Target tgt The results were the fruit of years of heavy investments in Kohls tech particularly fuller integration of stores and ecommerce improvements to its private brands better use of store space and bringing in brands such as Under Armour in 2017 and Apple and Fitbit earlier into its stores Indeed stores filled 38 of items ordered online making more efficient use of inventory and Kohls bet on activewear paid huge dividends with sales there rising 30 Kohls has made it Priority No 1 to get more people into its stores going so far as to test out a deep partnership with Amazoncom amzn that includes handling returns for its online rival and showcasing some of its products The strong holiday season came after years of stagnation from Kohls as it leaned on a playbook heavily focused on opening big box stores for years But now comes the even hard part keeping that momentum going Kevin Mansell who is stepping down as CEO in May after a decade at the helm says the Christmas period was very strong but believes that the companys moves in the last few years plus the constant innovation it is pursues will keep Kohls turnaround in good stead in the coming years and able to win back market share from competitors Weve done pretty well comparatively so to me that gap is company specific Mansell told Fortune earlier this week Kohls is doing some things better The company which operates some 1160 stores has benefited from seemingly straightforward but crucial steps such as improving the search capability of its web site so it more accurately reflect a customers prior purchases That kind of personalization is also improving Kohls marketing in a big way and Mansell thinks that will be a bigger factor next holiday season Under incoming CEO Michelle Gass who currently serves as Chief Merchandising and Customer Officer Kohls will likely continue to push lining up new merchandise by national brands but also continue to speed up lead times on its own brands which remain a more challenged part of its business Indeed some of Kohls improvements have come from removing some of its own products at stores where they were not catching on rather than imposing a onesizefitsall approach on its stores something that is easier now with stronger inventory management firepower On the tech side Mansell thinks the next steps potentially include features like the Smart Cart where a retailer offers online shoppers a discount if they go fetch an order in a store This is something Walmarts jetcom pioneered and that is likely to become a norm in retail Better tech is something that has enabled Kohls to get its app to help shoppers navigate the deals and discounts that are a Kohls fixture so that customers know what an items price ends up being more easily Mansell told the ICR conference this week that he thinks this Your price feature was behind 30 of online sales growth at the chain during the holidays Kohls may also decentralize some decisionmaking by giving individual stores better told to manage merchandise and payroll more efficient For now Kohls continues to use a small group of stores to pilot and test things to put the company at the vanguard of retail tech and not ever have to play catch up again as it did for a few years not that long ago Were still focused on innovation says Mansell Our business is getting a lot better It will up to him for the next four months and then Gass after that to continue to lead that

186,187,A Tempting Buyout Target?,A private equity bid for GKN looks a long shot.,https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2018-01-15/why-carlyle-takeover-of-melrose-target-gkn-would-be-long-shot,2018-01-15 11:57:55,GKN Plc looks a tempting target for private equity But it will be hard for the embattled UK engineer to lure a buyout firm into an auction against putative bidder Melrose Industries Plc The attractions of GKN to a financial sponsor are the same as those to Melrose Its a business that has long been poorly run with profitability below what Melrose and even its own management think is achievable It could also be broken up and sold off in parts each transaction offering the chance to make a turn GKN is already planning to split itself in two Melroses plan involves some less radical asset sales GKNs UK pension deficit 11 billion Whats more GKN seems to have a strong balance sheet Net debt is expected to end 2017 at 846 million pounds 12 billion or 08 times Ebitda Bloomberg data show That suggests scope for a buyout firm to use borrowed money to fund a deal Melroses 7 billionpound takeover proposal includes a plan to increase debt and pay out 14 billion pounds to GKN shareholders lifting the enlarged groups leverage to 25 times Ebitda Its not surprising then that Carlyle is considering an offer according to the Sunday Times The big obstacle is the targets UK pension deficit of 11 billion pounds The plans trustees would rightly demand more annual topups into the retirement program to compensate for the increased risk of a more heavily geared balance sheet That would lower the returns for the private equity owner There are other difficulties Private equity would want full ownership Melrose would give GKN shareholders a share in the enlarged company allowing them to benefit from whatever performance boost follows Institutional investors may be wary of selling to a private equity firm for fear of being embarrassed later on if the new owner makes great returns  a feeling they have suffered before To overcome all this a buyout firm would need to make a knockout offer In that scenario Melroses share price would suffer weakening the value of its proposal Theres a snag a price thats too high for Melrose would probably also be too high for private equity Melrose can certainly afford to pay more A 10 percent bump on its starting figure would lift the value of its proposed bid to about 445 pence a share giving it a more credible 37 percent premium to GKNs undisturbed share price That would cost 77 billion pounds or 85 billion pounds including assumed net debt If Melrose can drive operating margins to 10 percent operating profit net of tax would be roughly 880 million on the 11 billion pounds of revenue forecast for 2020 That would be equivalent to a 10 percent return comfortably exceeding GKNs own cost of capital Melrose can afford to be more generous Finding an allcash bidder that would force it to be so is another matter This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners To contact the author of this story Chris Hughes in London at chughes89bloombergnet To contact the editor responsible for this story Edward Evans at eevans3bloombergnet

248,249,Here Are The 180 Toys ‘R’ Us Stores That Are Closing,Toy retailer is closing 180 stores.,http://fortune.com/2018/01/24/toys-r-us-closings/,2018-01-24 18:55:53,As expected when it filed for bankruptcy protection last summer struggling toy retailer Toys R Us is closing an enormous number of stores 180 stores to be specific or nearly 20 of its fleet as it tries to get back to being a viable chain Toys R Us on Monday night asked federal bankruptcy court in Richmond Virginia for permission to close those stores saying it has faced a challenging commercial environment made worse it claimed by consumer preferences to online stores from brick and mortar stores The company had been weighed down by enormous debt levels  5 billion prebankruptcy and years of weak sales as business did indeed defect to Amazoncom amzn but also to major chains like Target tgt and Walmart wmt which have proven far more adept at withstanding competition from Amazon but also made their toy offerings far more enticing And those problems have persisted In a memo to staff obtained by Bloomberg News Toys R Us CEO Dave Brandon said the holiday season had been very challenging That followed a third quarter when comparable sales fell 7 in the United States as the turmoil of the bankruptcy exacerbated its already stumbling business Through the first three quarters of this fiscal year the chain had a net lost of 862 million The closures which include one in its hometown of Wayne NJ will begin in February and conclude by April and nearly half of the locations will be Babies R Us stores Baby products generated 45 of company revenues in the first nine months of the fiscal year Much like the steady drumbeat of Sears shld store closings in recent years have been a boon for rivals like JC Penney jcp and Home Depot hd Toys R Us will be turning over quite a bit of market share The stores generated 925 million last year according to court filings and Toys R Us likely wont be keeping much of that business Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink said in a research note on Wednesday that the Toys R Us website or a nearby store would help the company hang on to about 10 to 15 of sales at shuttered locations Those figures stand up Macys m which last year closed nearly 70 stores has said other stores and its web site capture about 12 of a stores sales when it closes a location Beyond that Walmart should get about 30 of that while Amazon would get as much as 40 Target which called out toys as a key category in its good holiday season numbers will also win some share UBS noted that 630 Toys R Us are within a 15min drive from a Target making it wellpositioned to take share Even more pressure could come as non traditional toy sellers like JC Penney and continue to step up their toys gameltpgt ltpgtMeanwhile these retailers will likely have even more clout with toymakers with a big reliance on Toys R Us including f500linkMattel mat Hasbro has and Jakks Pacific jakk key to negotiating more exclusive products In the meantime the move is aimed at helping Toys R Us focus its efforts on areas where it is hoping to stage a comeback But it has a long way to go according to many observers Toys R Us failed because its a poor retailer operating terrible stores and was rarely the lowest on price Neil Saunders Managing Director of GlobalData Retail said on Twitter These are the Toys R Us stores

214,215,ICE is about to start tracking license plates across the US,The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency has officially gained agency-wide access to a nationwide license plate recognition database.,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/26/exclusive-ice-is-about-to-start-tracking-license-plates-across-the-us.html,2018-01-26 15:06:00,The Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE agency has officially gained agencywide access to a nationwide license plate recognition database according to a contract finalized earlier this month The system gives the agency access to billions of license plate records and new powers of realtime location tracking raising significant concerns from civil libertarians The source of the data is not named in the contract but an ICE representative said the data came from Vigilant Solutions the leading network for license plate recognition data Like most other law enforcement agencies ICE uses information obtained from license plate readers as one tool in support of its investigations spokesperson Dani Bennett said in a statement ICE is not seeking to build a license plate reader database and will not collect nor contribute any data to a national public or private database through this contract Vigilant did not respond to multiple requests for comment While it collects few photos itself Vigilant Solutions has amassed a database of more than 2 billion license plate photos by ingesting data from partners like vehicle repossession agencies and other private groups Vigilant also partners with local law enforcement agencies often collecting even more data from cameraequipped police cars The result is a massive vehicletracking network generating as many as 100 million sightings per month each tagged with a date time and GPS coordinates of the sighting Read more from The Verge Heres Elon Musks 600 Boring Company flamethrower Google hired professional photographers to help train its AI camera The California pot industry isnt afraid of the US Attorney General ICE agents would be able to query that database in two ways A historical search would turn up every place a given license plate has been spotted in the last five years a detailed record of the targets movements That data could be used to find a given subjects residence or even identify associates if a given car is regularly spotted in a specific parking lot Knowing the previous locations of a vehicle can help determine the whereabouts of subjects of criminal investigations or priority aliens to facilitate their interdiction and removal an official privacy assessment explains In some cases when other leads have gone cold the availability of commercial LPR data may be the only viable way to find a subject ICE agents can also receive instantaneous email alerts whenever a new record of a particular plate is found  a system known internally as a hot list The same alerts can also be funneled to the Vigilants iOS app According to the privacy assessment as many as 2500 license plates could be uploaded to the hot list in a single batch although the assessment does not detail how often new batches can be added With sightings flooding in from police dashcams and stationary readers on bridges and toll booths it would be hard for anyone on the list to stay unnoticed for long Those powers are particularly troubling given ICEs recent move to expand deportations beyond criminal offenders fueling concerns of politically motivated enforcement In California state officials have braced for rumored deportation sweeps targeted at sanctuary cities In New York community leaders say theyve been specifically targeted for deportation as a result of their activism With automated license plate recognition that targeting would only grow more powerful For civil liberties groups the implications go far beyond immigration There are people circulating in our society who are undocumented says senior policy analyst Jay Stanley who studies license plate readers with the ACLU Are we as a society out of our desire to find those people willing to let our government create an infrastructure that will track all of us The new license plate reader contract comes after years of internal lobbying by the agency ICE first tested Vigilants system in 2012 gauging how effective it was at locating undocumented immigrants Two years later the agency issued an open solicitation for the technology sparking an outcry from civil liberties group Homeland Security secretary Jeh Johnson canceled the solicitation shortly afterward citing privacy concerns although two field offices subsequently formed rogue contracts with Vigilant in apparent violation of Johnsons policy In 2015 Homeland Security issued another call for bids although an ICE representative said no contract resulted from that solicitation As a result this new contract is the first agencywide contract ICE has completed with the company a fact that is reflected in accompanying documents On December 27th 2017 Homeland Security issued an updated privacy assessment of license plate reader technology a move it explained was necessary because ICE has now entered into a contract with a vendor The new system places some limits on ICE surveillance but not enough to quiet privacy concerns Unlike many agencies ICE wont upload new data to Vigilants system but simply scan through the data thats already there In practical terms that means driving past a Vigilantlinked camera might flag a car to ICE but driving past an ICE camera wont flag a car to everyone else using the system License plates on the hot list will also expire after one year and the system retains extensive audit logs to help supervisors trace back any abuse of the system Still the biggest concern for critics is the sheer scale of Vigilants network assembled almost entirely outside of public accountability If ICE were to propose a system that would do what Vigilant does there

250,251,How ‘The Lean Startup’ Turned Eric Ries Into an Unlikely Corporate Guru,"A guy who says he doesn't really like business now counts hundreds of executives as devotees, in Silicon Valley and beyond.",http://fortune.com/2018/02/22/lean-startup-eric-ries/,2018-02-22 11:30:10,The Warfield Theatre in San Franciscos gritty MidMarket neighborhood is a legendary temple of rock host over the years to the likes of Bob Dylan the Grateful Dead and Guns N Roses Its jarring then to walk through its beersoaked halls plop down onto a threadbare seat in the cavernous auditorium and listen to smartly dressed business types evangelizing about entrepreneurialism The speakers are an eclectic group yet theyre singing from the same buzzwordladen hymnal Jyoti Shukla vice president of user experience at retailer Nordstrom jwn enthuses about having a customerfirst mindset and an ability to ride with change and embrace discomfort Alex Osterwalder of the consultancy Strategyzer which coaches clients through innovation sprints urges attendees to have a 21stcentury org chart Even outposts of the federal government have mastered the lingo Ann Mei Chang a former chief innovation officer at the US Agency for International Development warns nonprofits not to measure success with vanity metrics and decries the perils of ramping too quickly The occasion for these sermons is the annual Lean Startup Conference in November and the speakers share a common trait They are disciples of Eric Ries author of The Lean Startup the seminal tract that spawned a selfproclaimed movement of which this is a convocation of the faithful The mantras they repeatmost prominently minimum viable product or MVP a companys quickest cheapest way to test the market and pivot which is what businesses do when failure demands a new approachall come from Riess 2011 book which has sold more than a million copies in English and has been published in 30 languages The mark Ries has made on the startup landscape cannot be overstated Entrepreneurs everywhere have adopted his vocabulary as well as his methods including testing their hypotheses with customers and gauging the success of innovation with relevant accounting measurements beyond revenues and market share He unequivocally has been as impactful on the mindset of startups as anyone else in the last decade says Rob Siegel who teaches entrepreneurship at Stanford Universitys business school The 39yearold guru himself is here too holding court in a dimly lit greenroom in the bowels of the theater He huddles with a grateful team from the National Security Agency which has implemented his techniqueson a project involving nuclear codes no less He brohugs Justin Rosenstein who holds the dubious distinction by his own admission of having invented the like button on Facebook fb and now runs Asana a collaboration software startup The conference is more labor of love than profitmaking effort for Ries who sports a mustacheless scraggly beard and in a pinch could play stunt double for actor Seth Rogen But the event also is an important linchpin in his oneman consulting publishing and speaking empire The companies that Ries has advised now number in the hundreds And while startups are his passion in the years since The Lean Startup appeared he came to realize the term had been too narrowly understood Properly nurtured he now says innovation lurks in the bellies of even the stodgiest corporations Riess second book The Startup Way published in October focuses squarely on big companies notably General Electric ge one of the first to hire Ries as a coach and to widely deploy his teachings Read  Teaching GE to Think Like a Startup excerpted from The Startup Way  Ries didnt seek out big companies which all had been innovative at some point but all too often have become bureaucratic processoriented and riskaverse But once they found him he realized he could help I had several years where I was living a double life he says On the one hand I was talking with these guyssuccessful entrepreneurswho were trying to figure out how to retain that startup DNA as they scaled At the same time a separate group of people were trying to recapture that DNA they had lost By following his own advice of relentlessly testing his hypotheses and asking questions Ries hit on a formula for corporate innovation thats relevant across the gamut of the business world His ideas can seem straightforward or even obvious on the page but like other adept teachers hes able to make them compelling and urgent in lectures conversations and coaching sessions Today hes even got a fledgling startup of his own an audacious gambit to create a new stock exchange focused on squelching the scourge of shorttermism on Wall Streetto the benefit of founders of his beloved startups Ries it turns out is the rare teacher who practices what he preaches potentially making his lessons all the more valuable for leaders of all stripes A few days after the Lean Startup Conference wraps Ries has holed up in an apartment he keeps as a writing retreat just down the street from his home in a leafy San Francisco neighborhood The walls and the couches are all white Its a simple hideaway a good place for reflection Ries needs the tranquil setting By late fall he already has traveled to New York Philadelphia Boston New York again and Los Angeles to promote the new book he has plans for a workshop with Procter amp Gamble pg in Cincinnati the following week and a trip to London after that He never expected to be in such demand After The Lean Startup came out Ries was inundated with invitations to lecture consult and coach a career he hadnt previously contemplated It just happened he says adding that it took a while to get used to people paying him to tell them what he thought Indeed Ries volunteers a startling admission for Silicon Valleys preeminent business guru This is probably not good for the profile he says the authorassubject anticipating the impact of his words but I dont really like business that much at least not as much as most of the people I talk to I actually kind of feel bad about it He says Jeffrey Immelt the erstwhile chief executive of GE once asked what Ries would do if he ran the conglomerate I was like I would die I wouldnt last 10 minutes It would destroy me  Related 5 Big Companies Practicing The Startup Way What came naturally to Ries was writing code and starting companies He grew up in San Diego where both of his parents are physicians and professors He has two younger sisters one a psychiatrist and the other a federal prosecutor Riess wife Tara Mohr a Stanford MBA is a life coach and author Im the black sheep of the family he quips the only one at Thanksgiving without an advanced degree He studied philosophy and then computer science at Yale dropped out to pursue a startup that flopped then finished school He quickly made his way to Silicon Valley to work on yet another failed startup At his next company IMVU Ries began developing the theories that would lead to the lean startup methodology IMVU which after several pivots now makes virtual avatars for social networks became known for rapid product iteration a process software people call agile development Ries and his cofounder Will Harvey had a guru of their own University of California at Berkeley professor Steve Blank who would go on to write his own innovation bestseller The Four Steps to the Epiphany Every Thursday we would get on BARTthe Bay Areas mass transit lineand go to Berkeley to audit his class recalls Harvey The irony of Riess subsequent exalted status among entrepreneurs is that none of his startups amounted to much IMVU still privately held with 60 million in profitable revenue today is a plodder by Silicon Valley standards Ries left in 2008 hung out for a time at venture firm Kleiner Perkins and mostly devoted himself to an increasingly popular blog about his observations on starting and scaling companies The blog got him going on the book which led to his speaking and consulting career Then big companies started calling Early in The Startup Way Ries compares the traits of an oldfashioned company and a modern company The contrasts are devastating for anyone who works at the former and wishes their employer were more like the latter An oldfashioned company in Riess estimation focuses on quarterly results has experts in functionalized silos and tracks metrics that make managers look good Middle managers intent on doing things how theyve always been done hold tremendous sway A modern company in contrast is longtermoriented utilizes crossfunctional teams deploys rapid experiments and measures the meaningful impact of business operations Above all modern companies empower entrepreneurial thinkers as change agents Riess criticisms amount to an indictment of most of the corporate world Initially he flatout resisted becoming a sage for big businesses But he gradually came to see a contradiction in his own philosophy Ries has a standard definition of a startup a human institution designed to bring something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty His rinseandrepeat presentation on the subject notes that his definition doesnt say anything about size of company stage its age sector industry and so on Its fundamentally about uncertainty he says And therefore anyone who meets this definition is an entrepreneur regardless of scale Over time as more denizens of the Fortune 500 came to hear him speakand called his bluffhis intellectual curiosity got the better of him and he accepted the challenge of working with megacorporations Ries reckoned that the trick for big companies was to stop thinking about their size They needed to form small groups devoted to the practice of innovation and empower and protect them on a continual basisas the core of the 21stcentury org chart his followers admire Once formed these smaller units could run experiments that were outside the norm of how their companies might typically launch products One of the most storied companies to give leanstartup thinking a whirl is Procter amp Gamble The consumer products Goliath has an impressive history of innovationit has 20 brands with more than 1 billion in annual salesbut in recent years growth had stalled The company hired Ries in 2016 to speak to its top commercial leaders He inspired them to get serious about speedier and leaner product testing says Kathy Fish PampGs chief research development and innovation officer Because were a big company we had lots of people involved with innovation she says Now we have small dedicated groups as small as three people One unexpected bonus of lean teams Fewer meetings bsquoteRies was asked what he would do if he were CEO of GE I was like I would die I wouldnt last 10 minutes It would destroy mebsquote While PampGs leanstartup experiments will take years to play out it already has seen a measurable change in its corporate mindset This past fall for example it began markettesting new versions of its Always and Tampax feminine pads in the US that featured simpler ingredients It deployed a transactional learning experiment that introduced early versions in 200 Target tgt stores PampG hoped the products would be popular with millennials and the limited speedy testthey got to market in a year compared with the typical threeconfirmed that customers would pay a premium Whereas before PampG would have conducted attitudinal research and large market tests now we get clear early on leapoffaith assumptions says Fish One of the three sizes for the pad initially tested poorly with consumers Traditionally that would have stalled the entire test instead PampG moved forward with two sizes At Riess most prominent test case General Electric upwards of 60000 employees have been trained in leanstartup methods They have worked on hundreds of projects from speedily designed aircraft engines to digital wind farms that help customers determine how best to deploy GE turbines The Ries way even has its own name at GE FastWorks which executives describe as a corporate way of life The language of the company has become the FastWorks language says Janice Semper culture transformation leader at GE That includes customer value understanding problems before we start and being smart about our thinking before we decide on capital allocation It speaks to the impact of Riess approach that FastWorks appears to have stuck at GE despite the departure of many of its champions including Immelt and Beth Comstock the vice chair who previously led GEs innovation efforts Of course GEs problems may be bigger than being more innovative New CEO John Flannery is so frustrated with anemic growth that he has floated the idea of breaking up the company Ries says hes cautiously optimistic about GE and confident the FastWorks efforts will bear meaningful fruit At the very end of The Lean Startup Ries addressed a policy matter that was bugging him He could help startups grow but he couldnt do much about the environment theyd face as public companies in a marketplace obsessed with shortterm financial goalsa climate that stifles innovation by discouraging risktaking He proposed a longterm stock exchange where companies would agree to focus on the long haul and investors would be rewarded for holding on to their shares longer Its business model would involve competing for IPO listings against traditional stock exchanges No one acted on Riess proposal so a few years later he founded a company called it the LongTerm Stock Exchange and began the arduous process of getting permission from the Securities and Exchange Commission to list and trade stocks In 2016 it raised 19 million from a bevy of VC firms including Andreessen Horowitz and techindustry luminaries It instituted novel governance rules like forbidding quarterly earnings guidance On the investor side LTSE proposed socalled tenured voting which gives shareholders who keep their stakes more voting power Traders would be free to dart in and out of stocks but theyd have little to no influence over management A rational guy Ries can approach righteous indignation when talking about the need for LTSE Fewer companies are going public he notes because its easier to stay private than face the wrath of ruthless activists and other shortterm actors I dont really understand what peoples plan is if this trend continues he says Were going to wind up with like seven public companies that are megaconglomerates and everything else is private Thats a terrible policy outcome Translating theory into reality has proved challenging however and despite the efforts of a 15person staff with Ries as CEO LTSE remains mostly an idea Last fall Ries said LTSE would file with securities regulators by the end of the year but in December the startup pivoted It reached an agreement with IEX a new stock exchange whose founders starred in Michael Lewiss bestseller Flash Boys whereby LTSElisted stocks will trade on IEX which already earned SEC approval Theres also the niggling and widespread fear that favoring longterm investors will decrease values of the listed companies Its an assertion LTSE disputes Were creating a system that allows companies to be held to a higher standard says Michelle Greene an Obama administration Treasury and NYSE veteran who is LTSEs chief policy officer When you really enable management to manage for the long term that will enable them to create more value For now LTSE faces classic chickenandegg dilemmas It cant list any company without SEC approval but once it can any company that chooses it for its IPO will risk the most important fundraising event in its history on an unproven concept Before you take a company public theres a lot you dont know says Dick Costolo the former CEO of Twitter and an LTSE investor Adds LTSE adviser Lise Buyer who runs a firm that helps startups go public Eric is trying to do good things but it will be a long hard climb Change comes very slowly to regulated markets Still Ries is so committed to the LongTerm Stock Exchange that its now his fulltime job He generally isnt taking on new consulting clients But he notes that a lot of other entities have taken up the slack Theres now a cottage industry of people who do startup consulting Cottage industry may be an understatement Corporate hunger for leanstartup help is so robust that groups with names like Bionic Moves the Needle and Leanstackand oodles more that roamed the halls at the Lean Startup Conferenceare ready to step in where Ries cant And Ries still has his hand in the game Stephen Liguori an exGE executive now runs an innovation consulting firm that plays Riesian roles for the likes of Dutch bank ING and Hong Kongs Jardine Matheson Liguori and Ries also have a new side business a membership organization called the Corporate Entrepreneurship Community that brings together innovation executives from large companies to compare best practices Charter members include GE MetLife met PampG Vanguard ING and HP hpe Ries who has two small children says there isnt much time left for hobbies But he does play piano and guitar and he has a new musical passion that indulges his geeky side I taught myself sound editing and audio engineering he says I like the programmable and modeled instrument trend They build a mathematical simulation of the physics of what the instrument would be and then generate the sound waves from that If he gets good enough Ries might even play the Warfield one day Eric Ries says that pressure from investors for shortterm results is keeping innovative companies from growing His solution The LongTerm Stock Exchange LTSE The company LTSE a 15person company of which Ries is CEO raised 19 million from investors in 2016 The mission To build a stock exchange whose rules and structure encourage longterm investing The rules Among other things companies that list on the exchange would be barred from issuing quarterly earnings guidance and investors who hold their shares longer would get more influence through tenured voting The obstacles LTSE doesnt yet have approval from the SEC to list or trade stocks And some companies fear that buying in to the concept would decrease their market value A version of this article appears in the March 2018 issue of Fortune with the headline The Accidental Guru Weve included affiliate links in this article Click here to learn

109,110,Commentary: Post-Parkland Courage: Why CEOs Aren’t Mything the Moment,Some recycle the myth that walls divide their private business enterprise job and public leadership duty.,http://fortune.com/2018/02/27/parkland-florida-school-shooting-business-leaders/,2018-02-27 15:29:13,After the high school shooting in Parkland Florida that killed 17 earlier this month CEOs are beginning to respond Several fastacting companies have severed ties with the NRA but is addressing such a problem the role of business CEOs are judged for their competence but also their character Yes leaders can be prompted or trapped by heroic myths Toughguy warriors John Wayne and Sylvester Rambo Stallone avoided military service while gunslinger Clint Eastwood served his country only as lifeguard at a pool in Californias Ft Ord during the Korean War Supposed rags to riches pillar Horatio Alger was actually a defrocked preacher who wrote a single novel and died penniless And no there really was no George Washington cherry true Similarly some CEOs recycle the myth that walls divide their private business enterprise job and public leadership duty Often chanting the 1970 quip of economist Milton Friedman The only responsibility of business is the bottom line some thus justify the current narrow commercial focus of their enterprise and the major trade associations In reality the sectors are hybrid todayand were in economist Adam Smiths day as well The Business Roundtable was forged by progressive business leaders from IBM IBM GE GE GM GM DuPont and other top firms to address societal concernsthe very same year that Milton Friedman condemned such social missions They wanted to burnish the bad image of business from the 1960s I knew these industrialists who successfully championed the Superfund environmental cleanup the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act fair hiring practices here and abroad and training for workers displaced through trade and technology There is a myth that the NRA and the big business lobby always opposed business regulation and gun control Earlier generations of business leaders promoted regulation in finance interstate commerce travel telecommunications and food safety Business leaders along with the NRA actually favored historic gun regulation such as the 1934 National Firearms Act outlawing assault weaponsthen gangsterrevered submachine gunsTommy guns They supported The Violent Crime Control Act of 1994 banning militarystyle semiautomatic assault weapons but that act expired a decade later Then the leaders changed Through new angry ideological filters the NRA flipped lobbying against legislative renewal efforts The Second Amendment became the only absolute right without boundaries Now a dozen states that even block cell phones gum and smoking in courtrooms allow deadly weapons Is no backyard artillery banned under the Constitutions regulated militia There is a big disconnect with the public Last year a national gun owner survey sponsored by Americans for Responsible Solutions suggested most gun owners 67 believe that the NRA has lost its historic mission promoting gun safety to one of lobbying for gun makers interests According to a Quinnipiac poll released last week 67 of Americans favor a ban on assault weapons Even 97 of Americans favor enhanced background checks and other measures the NRA blocks With the nation rattled by 345 mass shootings in 2017 plus the deadliest year for such incidents the public is looking to transcend NRA lobbying With 5 of the worlds population the US has onethird of the worlds mass shootings 25 times that of other affluent nations While politicians and business leaders were stunned last August after President Trumps initial failure to condemn white supremacists in the wake of violent protests in Charlottesville Va adhoc actions by individual CEOs filled the void left by politicians and trade associations The inspiring action of Merck MRK CEO Ken Frazier to quit President Trumps manufacturing council with a statement condemning the normalization of hate groups ultimately sparked the conscience of others and led to the collapse of several White House business advisory councils in protest Last month Blackrock CEO Larry Fink boldly proclaimed business must step up He wrote Society is demanding that companies both public and private serve a social purpose To prosper over time every company must not only deliver financial performance but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society Paradoxically Blackrock is the largest owner of major assault weapon makers American Outdoor Brands Smith amp Wesson at 11 and Sturm Ruger at 16 but has demurred from demanding AR15 discontinuance claiming that the ownership stakes are merely passive holdings through its index funds Those index funds however select stocks based on a mix of objective and subjective business conduct criteria This is how the Florida Retirement System inadvertently owned stakes in these same gun makers that killed its teachers Fink has to find a balance between those holdings and his call for responsible corporate citizenship Some CEOs are fearful of taking a stand and triggering customer backlashes or shareholder revolts But scores of customer establishments across the nation have long banned guns including AMC Theaters BBT Bank Chipotle CMG  Chilis Costco COST  Delta DAL  Hooters IKEA JackintheBox JACK  JoAnn Stores Panera Regal Theaters Sonic Starbucks SBUX  Target TGT  United Airlines US Bank Waffle House and Walgreens WBA Walmart WMT dropped the AR 15 In rapid succession First National Bank of Omaha Symantec SYMC Alamo Budget Hertz National Enterprise Twitter TWTR and Wyndham WYN broke ties with the NRA late last week Instead of fearing boycotts for snubbing the gun lobby many business leaders now fear the opposite backlash as those with continuing NRA ties are showcased by public safety advocates And 66 of consumers believe it is important for brands to address sociopolitical issues like gun control Nonprofits are taking to social media to encourage media and tech companies to block NRA ads BoycottNRA was the number one trending topic on Twitter Friday in the United States Akin to the business leadership response to Mercks Frazier the cracks in the dam spread slowly at first and then there is a groundswell Many corporate leaders are earning the business the oldfashioned way Jeffrey Sonnenfeld is Senior Associate Dean for Leadership Studies and Lester Crown Professor of Management Practice at the Yale School of Management as well as author of Firing Back How CEOs Rebound From Career DisastersHarvard Business School Press

88,89,Why Walmart Is Testing Robots In Stores—and Here’s What Its Learned,The company wants machines to track its store inventory.,http://fortune.com/2018/03/26/walmart-robot-bossa-nova/,2018-03-26 22:07:05,Inside 50 of Walmarts US stores robots resembling vacuum cleaners affixed with small sleek towers patrol the aisles checking whether the shelves are stocked with enough toilet paper and that laundry detergent has the correct price tag Walmart is testing the robots built by Bossa Nova Robotics to see if they can monitor store inventory more cheaply than human workers The test reflects the increasing adoption of technology by big retailers as they try to keep up with online retail giant Amazon amzn which uses robots in some of its warehouses in addition to other cuttingedge technology Target tgt and Lowes low are already testing robots in physical stores for handling mundane jobs like scanning shelves Target for example is using the robotic services of the startup Simbe Robotics to scan aisles Every day one of Walmarts robots rolls down every aisle three times to check that over 150000 products are where they should be on store shelves Martin Hitch chief business officer for Bossa Nova Robotics said Monday at the MIT Technology Reviews EmTech Digital conference in San Francisco The robot will keep a record whether there isnt enough toilet paper or if an item doesnt have the right price tag From there a human store clerk will either restock the aisle or put the right price tag on the product because the robots are not physically capable of doing so Among the findings from Walmarts test is that peoples perceptions change the longer they see the robots in action For example two years ago when Bossa Nova first installed a robot at a Walmart store in rural Pennsylvania local residents were very curious about the machines and spent time gawking at them Hitch said but they now completely ignore them Its allowed to do its job Hitch said When asked how different types of people react to the robots Hitch said that children particularly school children tend to be very respectful of the robot Adults on the other hand sometimes either goof around with the robots by asking how they are doing or other silly questions or ignore them Teenagers however pose a challenge for Bossa Novas Walmart robots because of their mischievous nature Hitch said Weve been hit with shopping bags Hitch said about the robots Weve been deliberately kicked Hitch said that Bossa Nova has gotten used to teenagers playing pranks on robots and that the company has taken that into account in its robot designs Presumably these robots must be built in a way that they can withstand having cans of tomato soup thrown at them by high schoolers Another thing Bossa Nova did was to design the robots to look more friendly to humans by installing a small display screen and lighting on its small body The screen and lighting which is also where the robots main computer resides helps distract people from the larger minitower affixed to the robot on which is affixed sensors that scan items on the shelf Get Data Sheet Fortunes technology newsletter Hitch said that when the company asked customers to describe the robot nobody realized it was two meters tall because they focused on the smaller robot body resembling the Star Wars cylindrical robot R2D2 and not its tower which comprises the bulk of the robots height of around 65 feet Walmart hasnt revealed if its saving money by using Bossa Novas robots but considering its testing them out in more stores the retail company appears to be pleased its spending money on the startup
143,144,The shady data-gathering tactics used by Cambridge Analytica were an open secret to online marketers,"Market researchers and digital marketers have known about — and in many cases, used — these tactics for years, Alexandra Samuel writes for The Verge.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/27/cambridge-analyticas-data-gathering-tactics-were-an-open-secret.html,2018-03-27 13:14:00,The recently revealed Facebook data breach that allowed Cambridge Analytica to get access to millions of users worth of Facebook data has been greeted as a shocking scandal Reporters and readers have been surprised to learn about the ability to gather personal data on the friends of people who install a Facebook app the conversion of a personality quiz into a source of political data the idea that you can target marketing messages based on individual psychographic profiles and the surreptitious collection of data under the guise of academic research later used for political purposes But there is one group of people who are mostly unsurprised by these revelations the market researchers and digital marketers who have known about and in many cases used these tactics for years Im one of them Back when the Cambridge Analytica data was getting collected by an enterprising academic I was the vice president of social media for Vision Critical a customer intelligence software company that powers customer feedback for more than a third of the Fortune 100 companies Our enterprise clients wanted to know how social media data could complement the insights they were getting from their customer surveys and it was my job to come up with a way of integrating social media data with survey data Vision Criticals blue chip customer roster made us an appealing target for the many social media vendors hawking datagathering solutions In 2012 the data analytics firm Microstrategy pitched me on their Wisdom tool for Facebook which the company had touted as a data source based on 12 million anonymous optedin Facebook users But when I spoke with an analyst at Microstrategy that December he told me that the companys data set  by then nearly 175 million strong was based on just 52600 actual installs each of which provided access to an average of 332 friends Nor was Microstrategy doing something unusual The tactic of collecting friend data which has been featured prominently in the Cambridge Analytica coverage was a wellknown way of turning a handful of app users into a goldmine We were all conscious that friend data was accessible says Sam Weston a communications consultant who has been working in digital marketing and market research for nearly two decades I dont think that anybody had perspective on the potential consequences until it was slotted into this news story where the consequence may have been the election of Donald Trump More from The Verge Google Clips can now take highresolution photos Apple iPad education event start time and live blog Twitter demonstrates the future of Windows 10 apps Mary Hodder a longtime privacy consultant who is now the product developer for the Identity Ecosystem Steering Group was equally unsurprised I knew 10 years ago that Facebooks API allowed an entity to gather friend data Hodder told me But I wasnt surprised that the 95 percent of the population that didnt understand this were shocked They thought if Facebook was going to sell you out it would just be you They didnt know you would take all your friends with you If Facebooks generous access to friend data was known to many marketers and software developers so was the tactic of disguising data grabs as fun apps pages or quizzes Another company I spoke with back in 2012 was LoudDoor a Facebook advertising company that offered enhanced ad targeting based on the data they were gathering from millions of Facebook users The company ran a network of Facebook pages that were essentially content farms like the Diving Wrecks and Reefs page that consisted of pretty underwater photos Interspersed with all the photos were occasional comeons for fan surveys that would enter you in a contest taking the survey meant installing a fan satisfaction app that gave LoudDoor access to all your data Pages and apps like this might have seemed innocent to the average Facebook user but people in the marketing community were hardly deceived It was pretty common knowledge among people who understood the internet that if you were taking a quiz to find out what kind of cheese you are somebody on the other end is very interested in getting that data says Susanne Yada a Facebook ad strategist I wish I could say I was more surprised and more alarmed I just assumed that if you take a quiz someone would know who you are because you are signed into Facebook Among the ubiquitous datagathering apps of that period the personality quiz that Cambridge Analytica created was nothing special It is actually stunning to think with the clarity that perspective brings that you could stand up the kind of ridiculous quiz or survey that they did and then walk away with psychographic profiles on 50 million Americans Weston muses now Even for someone who worked in the field the Cambridge Analytica story was a moment that gave you real pause to reflect on the business that we walked away from but that was a massive part of the industry for a long time And yes these fun apps gathered your friends data too the LoudDoor salesperson I spoke with at the time told me that they had close to 12 million users which gave them access to data on 85 million Americans But that friend data grab was far from clear to fans of the page even if the companys disclosure notice explained that the purpose of its app was to ensure that brands can make better decisions about which content they should promote to you As for the idea that the purpose of gathering data is to target ads  well Cambridge Analytica is scarcely an outlier there either Mary Hodder recalls working with a company called Apisphere that used location data for ad targeting back in 2008 and 2009 We did this project for the Hard Rock Cafe Casino in Las Vegas Hodder told me They wanted to put wands in the ceiling to collect the IMEI identification numbers of every phone that went by map everywhere they went in the casino or on the property and map them in the hallways up to their rooms And then they could do a reverse lookup on IMEI numbers because there are companies that aggregate IMEI numbers and as soon as they figured out who the person was they could send them offers text them offers and the people had not opted in So they were basically just intercepting your phone and figuring out how to send messages to you in one form or another Hodder remembers objecting to this as at a meeting where the rest of her colleagues saw nothing amiss with the practice thats how normal it was to harvest data and use it to target individual ads long before Cambridge Analytica got in on the action For those of us who were witness to the look what we can do explosion of datadriven marketing tactics it takes some reflection to understand why the practices of Cambridge Analytica have surprised so many people When you say Were creating psychological profiles to sway people marketers have been doing that since marketing existed Yada observes But I think theres a difference between actually representing what your services are and how they can help people versus being really clandestine and trying to sway people with fake news The fundamental problem is the gap in understanding about what Facebooks business model actually is Weston says You know how Targets business model works or how Apples business model works but nobody understands how these folks digital marketers actually make money Thats not just true for Facebook but for every adsupported business and every datasupported business which is just about every tech company Facebook did a good job talking to Wall Street about how their business works but at no point did they actually talk to their users Given the widespread normalization of deceptive data gathering and marketing tactics I count myself lucky that the company I worked with didnt buy into the frenzy of the social media data gold rush Because Vision Critical had its roots in the market research industry where there are norms and codes of practice around how you handle respondent data the idea of grabbing up friend data was utterly anathema the companys founder dismissed it as a nonstarter the very first time it came up and at every stage in developing our own Facebook app we disclosed that we were using it to gather data But the whole time it felt like we were swimming against the tide by following oldschool standards for transparency and accountability in how we handled data I hate to admit how many times I pitched my colleagues on some clever way of incentivizing people to connect to Facebook based on some scheme or app Id just stumbled across only to be reminded that it would violate our data or privacy policies If Id been working in a digital marketing agency where gamifying data requests was the norm I can easily see how I might have yielded to the temptation of disguising a data grab with a recreational app or scooping up friend data just because it was there That experience points to how difficult it will be to reform not just Facebook but the larger industry of data collectors and marketing shops that have evolved to maximize the amount of data collected and the precision of ad targeting Social networks and other advertising platforms may set up various processes that notionally screen out data aggregators or manipulative advertisers but as long as these companies run on advertising revenue they have little incentive to promote transparency among data brokers and advertisers And those industries in turn have little motivation to place ethics ahead of profit The outrage now directed at Cambridge Analytica and Facebook suggests there might be an appetite for an online ecosystem based on a different compact between consumers platforms and advertisers But we wont build that ecosystem by pretending that this is a matter of a few bad actors Its time for us to face up to what online marketers and researchers have known for more than a decade the contemporary Internet runs on the exploitation of user data and that fact wont change until consumers regulators and businesses commit to a radically different model Alexandra Samuel is the former VP of Social Media for Vision Critical She is now an independent technology writer and a regular contributor to The Wall Street Journal JSTOR Daily and The Harvard Business Review

212,213,How this 32-year-old high school dropout built a business that sold to Target for $550 million,"For Bill Smith, perseverance, trial and error and a grueling grocery trip lead to the success of online grocery delivery service Shipt.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/29/how-bill-smith-founded-shipt-and-sold-it-to-target.html,2018-03-29 14:07:00,By December 2017 Shipt orders had surged 60 percent from that June Bloomberg reported and the company was expecting to hit 1 billion in revenue in 2018 At the time Shipt launched in 2014 other sameday delivery startups were also cropping up Instacart another sameday delivery grocery service based in San Francisco had been in operation since 2012 and was serving up customers in major metro areas like San Francisco New York and Los Angeles Amazon Fresh launched in Seattle in 2007 was also expanding its reach at the time But Smith believes Shipt being based in the South played an integral role in its success When we started Shipt we were really focused on what I call mainstream American families We started in the South and we focused on really a lot of secondary type cities Smith says like Birmingham as well as Tampa and Orlando Florida We were the first ones to bring the service there so people viewed us as the ones creating the market he adds Now the rivals operate in overlapping markets Instacart serves shoppers in many smaller areas and Shipt has expanded to larger metro areas like Chicago and Dallas Since acquiring Whole Foods Amazon has pulled the plug on some AmazonFresh delivery areas but is still available in cities including New York Philadelphia and DC And there are of course new competitors For example Walmart announced plans to expand its grocery delivery service to 100 metro areas by the end of 2018 Instacart despite courting some controversy continues to be financially successful  the company recently partnered with six of the top seven grocers in North America and raised a new round of funding which values the company at 42 billion But Smith says theres something that still makes Shipt stand out The fact that the shoppers go above and beyond is really the key to this Smith says For example a member will order a childrens cough syrup or some item that indicates the customer has a sick child at home and our shopper will pick up a balloon for their child and deliver it with the order The future of Shipt While Smith says he had been actively pursuing Target as a partner retailer since Shipts inception it wasnt until the summer of 2017 that a Target team member reached out The conversations moved from partnership to a potential investment to allout acquisition says Smith I met with some of their senior leaders and it was clear they were very supportive of what we were doing And they would be a really great match In December Target acquired Shipt for more than half a billion dollars Sameday delivery is a service that our guests are asking for more and more often By acquiring Shipt well be able to take advantage of our network of stores and Shipts technology platform and shopper community to quickly offer sameday delivery to millions of our guests John Mulligan Targets chief operating officer recently said in a QampA in December Since then Target has begun rapidly rolling out the service offering sameday delivery of groceries and other products on Shipts platform in a slew of locations in Florida Along with the latest roll out in Target stores in Washington DC and Baltimore Shipt is expected to be available in the majority of Target locations by the end of 2018 Shipt will remain a wholly owned Target subsidiary run its business independently will still offer its services at other retailers and will continue to operate its businesses from its current offices in Birmingham and San Francisco For Smith thats important because he says Shipts success is rooted in a simple concept treating people both his employees and customers well That he says can make all the difference I think thats a really simple way to be successful in just about anything Smith says And a lot of people miss it
113,114,What Retailers Can Learn From Kohl’s Small Store Strategy,"Smaller stores are retail's path forward, as Kohl's shows.",http://fortune.com/2018/04/02/kohls-small-stores/,2018-04-02 15:14:54,Kohls kss is the rare retailer bucking the trend of closing stores despite declining sales at many of its physical locations Instead the company has taken a different tack shrinking hundreds of stores in its 1160location fleet from 90000 square feet or so to 60000 or so It is also refining an even smaller 35000 square foot store model at 12 locations and could roll it out to even more a move that could increase its store count and allow it to hit new markets including city centers The idea is simple Kohls needs the same number of stores to serve shoppers in all corners of the country to maintain brand presence and more crucially help support ecommerce since more and more shoppers prefer to pick up orders instore Rivals Macys m and JC Penney jcp have only replaced a fraction of business lost from stores theyve closed with online sales But because online is now 18 of company sales and sales per square foot of store space are down 15 compared to a few years ago Kohls needs to rethink stores role It doesnt need to stock every item it offers in every size or configuration in a store or have it serve as a glorified distribution center So the smaller store effort represents a happy medium one that with the help of tech will get Kohls more bang for its buck and lift profits The goal line keeps moving because companies like Amazon continue to get faster and better so you have to get faster and better Mansell told Fortune on a recent visit to a small Kohls store in East Windsor NJ Kohls is not alone in thinking smaller is bigger Target tgt has had tremendous success with that format Macys m has shrunk some of its key stores and even Nordstrom jwn is giving the idea a go with its nomerchandise Nordstrom Local store in Los Angeles that it may bring to new markets After stagnating for several years Kohls seems to have regained its momentum in recent quarters And to keep that going Mansell who is stepping down as CEO next month after 10 years in the corner office to be replaced by chief merchandising and customer officer Michelle Gass has made it a big priority to figure out how to make small formats work Its nothing less than a revolution for a retailer used to operating stores in a cookie cutter way for decades and its far more complex than Honey I Shrank the Store But done right it will lead to healthier profits and more productive use of space For instance the frequency of merchandise deliveries has to change so does how much product gets put on shelves Its a different beast he says He concedes people dont go to Kohls to browse and discover they go to find what they need and get out So smaller stores mean being that much more precise about inventory A key component to achieving this is tech Not the cool features many retailers including Kohls were drawn to for years like fun mirrors for testing makeup Rather the unsexy but essential technologies such as inventory management are what matters most On top of a stellar holiday quarter where Kohls comparable sales rose 63 its gross margin was up thanks in large part to a 7 drop in inventory In simpler terms it means Kohls is planning inventory better and not having to sell as much as clearance as before And Kohls can reap savings on not shipping items to stores that it wont end up selling as it has seen with the 300 stores it has shrunk and expects to see with the smallest stores as they open There are a ton of shiny objects and you can go down a rabbit hole of technology like you wouldnt believe he says That is good for a press release but when you look at what those things actually do they dont perform The smaller format stores allow Kohls to take out many costs and make it more flexible For example the East Windsor store has fewer fixtures and needs fewer personhours to staff It has fewer departments and but it has open ceilings brighter lighting and offers clear sight lines so a shopper can see pretty much the entire store by doing a 360 turn The absence of walls and its new fixtures means the store can expand a section as needed as it has with activewear a fast growing category for Kohls The Kohls has five cash registers and only one entrance compared to the average 12 cashiers and two entrances All in all the store holds 60 of the inventory a regular Kohls does but 70 of the assortment This Kohls store doesnt sell the Jennifer Lopez apparel line or jewelry for instance but does have proportionately more activewear and office wear The smaller size means the retailer can use the 35000 square foot format to get into smaller markets that wouldnt support a standard Kohls such as Marshfield Wisconsin a city of 20000 And with many of the 138 stores JC Penney jcp closed in 2017 being in smaller markets that is no small opportunity to grab some market share Whats more the format could allow the stripcentercentric Kohls to get into urban markets much like Target is with its smaller stores The idea of making stores smaller and more efficient is gaining traction and we are further down that road than our competitors says Mansell

65,66,Hammerson Could Have Been Hoisted With Its Own Petard,French suitor could have used target's bid defense against it.,https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2018-04-13/hammerson-could-be-hoisted-with-its-own-petard,2018-04-13 06:16:14,A foreign assault on the UKs critical shopping infrastructure has been thwarted French property developer Klepierre SA has pulled its plan to buy Londonbased peer Hammerson Plc It seems to have had no appetite for a hostile fight and insufficient shareholder support for paying the sort of price required for the target boards approval Yet a bid over the heads of Hammerson management would have had a fighting chance of success Hammerson rejected a Klepierre takeover proposal worth 635 pence a share or 5 billion pounds 71 billion on Wednesday The mooted price was a near50 percent premium to Hammersons market value before Klepierre popped up and the targets shares were trading well below that level A firm offer would have attracted merger arb funds to Hammersons register giving Klepierre sight of majority support But the UK commercial property market is very difficult right now retail especially Britain is not Klepierres expertise A hostile victory might have been Pyrrhic if it led to a brain drain from the the Hammerson HQ The snag was getting Hammerson chairman David Tyler to back a bid after his recent comments on price Tyler argues that Hammersons shares suffer a disconnect from the reality shown by its net asset value the expert portfolio valuation that last came in at a thumping 790 pence a share His argument cut both ways Klepierres shares trade at a discount to NAV too Its proposal  25 billion pounds in cash plus a roughly 22 percent stake in the combined company  was worth much more when you value the stock component using the duos punchy NAVs instead of Klepierres weak share price Thats how Bloomberg Intelligence crunches things and the overall number came out at 714 pence a share True thats still a 10 percent discount to Hammersons NAV But Klepierre wouldnt have had to close the gap completely Consider Hammersons recent allshare offer for rival Intu Properties Plc That was a 34 percent discount to the targets NAV when based on Hammersons lowly share price If you reckon Hammerson shares are worth their NAV the discount was just 5 percent The dynamics mean Klepierre could have sweetened its proposal and put real pressure on Tyler to talk Suppose it had dangled 3375 pence in cash per Hammerson share plus a 235 percent stake in the combination That stake would also have been worth 3375 pence per share based on Klepierres closing share price Thursday The total offer would ostensibly have been worth 675 pence Value the equity part using the NAV of the combination and its value shoots up to 412 pence a share making the overall offer worth nearly 750 pence a share the same 5 percent discount as seen in the Intu deal For Klepierre shareholders leverage would have been uncomfortable although probably only temporarily and NAV per share would be higher than it is today Still this would have been a bigger sweetener than the one Klepierre provided this week Deals dont normally progress in ever larger bumps Klepierre credibility would have been weakened A hostile bid may well have succeeded This was close Hammersons Bicester Village has been saved for the nation  but only for now This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners To contact the author of this story Chris Hughes in London at chughes89bloombergnet To contact the editor responsible for this story James Boxell at jboxellbloombergnet

25,26,Retail's Other Problem: Too Few Clerks in the Store,"Many of America’s biggest retailers, under assault from Amazon, have been slashing staff even faster than they have been closing stores, a dynamic that has left fewer clerks and longer checkout lines.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/retails-other-problem-too-few-clerks-in-the-store-1525080601,2018-04-30 09:56:36,Many of Americas biggest retailers under assault from Amazoncom Inc have been slashing staff even faster than they have been closing stores a dynamic that has left fewer clerks and longer checkout lines at remaining locations Despite operating roughly the same number of stores as it did a decade ago Macys Inc M 139 has shed 52000 workers since 2008 At JC Penney Co JCP 161 workers have disappeared twice as fast as department stores Thats led to an average of 112 total Penney employees for every store today down from 145 a decade ago according to a Wall Street Journal analysis Similar perstore staff declines occurred over the past decade at Kohls Corp KSS 243 Nordstrom Inc JWN 386 Target Corp TGT 135 and Walmart Inc WMT 074 regardless of whether the retailer opened or closed stores according to the Journals analysis The employment figures are for all full and parttime staff and dont distinguish between store warehouse or headquarters workers Industry executives say store employees make up the vast majority of retailers workforce Retailers are shooting themselves in the foot trying to save pennies by lowering labor costs and thats costing them dollars on the top line said Rogelio Oliva a business school professor at Texas AampM University He recently analyzed the relationship between sales and labor at a womens clothing retailer and found that many of the stores were understaffed by as much as 15 leading to potentially lower sales Some companies attribute the declining head count to staff cuts at headquarters and a switch to smaller stores that need fewer workers Others have added technology such as selfcheckout lanes or shelfready packaging that they say makes existing workers more productive And still others have hired more fulltime workers eliminating the need for two or three parttimers Now some retailers are discovering they may have gone too far and are beginning to replenish staffjust as the booming US economy is creating historic labor shortages and forcing companies to pay higher wages and offer perks such as better training and benefits Kroger Co KR 043 said this month it will hire 11000 workers to improve customer service and speed checkouts at its nearly 2800 grocery stores Dicks Sporting Goods Inc DKS 382 wants to increase store labor by about 10 said Chief Executive Edward Stack reversing a decadelong trend Over the holidays Dicks added more cashiers because if theres one thing that drives me nuts its waiting at the register Mr Stack said in an interview Macys said it is adding staff this year at 50 stores in areas where the extra bodies will have the most impact including in fitting rooms and in the dress womens shoes and handbag departments Retail staffing hasnt kept pace with growth in the broader economy or population gains in the past decade The number of salespeople at retailers grew by 15 over the past decade even though the population served by each store has increased 125 according to government data At clothing and accessories stores the number of cashiers is down more than 50 from 2007 Many retailers are at the tipping point of cutting too much labor said Craig Rowley a senior partner in the retail division of Korn Ferry International an executivesearch firm If you cut staff every year pretty soon youre at minimal staffing Gilbert McGarvey has worked at the flagship Saks Fifth Avenue store in New York City for 24 years most recently in the shoe department It used to be what we sold was service he said Now theyve cut that to the quick Saks last year closed the service desk at its flagship store and reduced support staff which has meant that sales associates now have to process returns and spend more time restocking shelves and fulfilling online orders tasks that take them away from selling Mr McGarvey said A spokeswoman for Hudsons Bay Co which owns Saks said the Manhattan store had trimmed support staff by 2 but added 15 service advisers near the stores entrances to help guide shoppers Across the board workers had been stretch so thin that the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union stipulated in its latest contract signed last year that its members have the right to drop all other responsibilities to help care of customers first If brickandmortar retailers cant compete on price in an online environment the only thing that allows them to survive is to provide a positive instore experience said Stuart Appelbaum the unions president Jessica Tokarski recently stopped by a Target store in Orchard Park NY to buy a phone case But the 23yearold couldnt find anyone to unlock it from the rack so she left the store without making a purchase Ive turned to online shopping because customer service in stores has gotten really bad Ms Tokarski said A Target spokeswoman said the retailer has added workers to its stores over the past year and is providing them with more training She said a large part of Targets headcount reduction was the result of the 2015 sale of its pharmacy business to CVS Health Corp which shifted 15000 jobs Over the past 12 months 86 of US consumers say they have left a store due to long lines according to a survey conducted by Adyen a creditcard processor and payment system That has resulted in 377 billion in lost sales for retailers Adyen estimates Retailers typically set staffing as a percent of sales but a growing body of research suggests it should be based on foot traffic The problem is twofold Many retailers dont track traffic and even if they do they are reluctant to add labor which is already among their biggest costs If youve got a lot of foot traffic but a lull in sales you need to put more staff in your stores said Mark Ryski the chief executive of HeadCount Corp a dataanalytics firm that tracks footfall at stores around the country Some companies are listening After installing cameras last year Cycle Gear Inc a 130store chain that sells motorcycle apparel and accessories noticed sales dipped during the afternoon at its Orlando Fla store even though it was packed with shoppers That told us the salespeople were overwhelmed said Rodger OKeefe a vice president We added two more sales people during those hours and sales have been up since then Theo Francis contributed to this article Write to Suzanne Kapner at SuzanneKapnerwsjcom

18:35:00,WHEN Today Tuesday May 1st WHERE CNBCs Capital Exchange event Following is the unofficial transcript of CNBCs Sara Eisens sit down interview with Stanley Fischer Former Vice Chairman Federal Reserve and Richard Fisher Former President and CEO Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas today at CNBCs new Capital Exchange event All references must be sourced to CNBCs Capital Exchange SARA EISEN Thank you Thanks Nik RICHARD FISHER All right SARA EISEN Love being introduced as a geek Welcome Im pleased to have both Fisher former Fed insiders Cause were gonna get the full scoop Cause neither of them are on the Fed or bound by their communications policies anymore So this is exciting And just to review the years here so Stanley Fischer joined the Federal Reserve as vice chairman in 2014 through 2017 Richard Fisher joined 2005 to 2015 Our current Fed chairman was the governor from 2012 So youve both worked with him You both know him Stan tell us about Chairman Jay Powell something we dont know STANLEY FISCHER Well Jay is the sort of person youd like to have as chair of the Fed Hes very calm He knows a lot He doesnt show off And he will my guess is will surprise us on the upside because he is duly modest about a lot of things more so than is necessary I think he I would like to say a word in favor of the administration before I get going which is SARA EISEN Really STANLEY FISCHER which is they have appointed so far a very good team to the Fed And I dont think you see much politics in whats going on in the appointments to the Federal Reserve board And that was a concern And it no longer needs to be a concern So thats a very good thing And Jay will handle that well Plus the you didnt ask me about this but if I may SARA EISEN Please STANLEY FISCHER Appointing John Williams as head of the SARA EISEN New York STANLEY FISCHER New York Fed is a very good idea RICHARD FISHER Very good STANLEY FISCHER Hes a very good economist SARA EISEN And Rich Clarida replaces you STANLEY FISCHER And Richard Clarida is RICHARD FISHER How do you replace God SARA EISEN Its hard RICHARD FISHER Impossible SARA EISEN Big shoes to fill RICHARD FISHER All right Moses SARA EISEN So you know Richard STANLEY FISCHER Well I and theyd had to replace God They found a successor to him SARA EISEN Richard you know Jay Powell pretty well Whats interesting is actually he has no formal economic training RICHARD FISHER This is true SARA EISEN not a PhD economist like yourself unlike Dr Fischer RICHARD FISHER Well again but I think thats important actually in this case He understands capital markets He came up through that channel He understands credit Remember Paul Volcker did not have a PhD in economics He came up through the Chase and the credit side under Robert Rose and David Rockefeller actually But heres a little secret about Jay I can never get him to drink more than one glass of wine when we have dinner Hes about as moderate Stan and level headed as you could possibly be And I agree with Stan You couldnt have a better person in this position today And I remember his first meeting which was June of 2012 He warned us that we were taking volatility out of the system and that eventually it will return So I think hes a little more comfortable with this He expected it And we havent gotten abnormal volatility But were back to some norms And I dont think it dissuades them from pursuing the path of policy And I wanna double down on Stans comment John Williams who I had the pleasure of being with almost my entire time there he succeeded Janet at the San Francisco Fed is really a perfect choice for two reasons One is hes a brilliant economist And hes gonna bring a lot to the table Remember the vice chair of the FOMC is the president of the New York Fed So he gets the penultimate word at the table And the other good thing for John is hes moving from the secondmostexpensive city in America to the mostexpensive city in America So he can afford to be here SARA EISEN Into New York RICHARD FISHER Good guy SARA EISEN Tell us a little bit about that table what happens inside those Fed meetings Stan How heated does it get when it comes to making m monetary policy STANLEY FISCHER He well my guess is based purely on hearsay that it is much less heated than it wouldve been before they published the transcripts within five years of the meeting And you are aware that what you say is going to be read by millions perhaps And so people come with prepared speeches And they deliver them And its all very serious And it doesnt get heated There are sometimes exchanges between particular people whove been friends for a long time and things like that which are funny And you know underneath the fun theres a needle SARA EISEN Thats Richard right STANLEY FISCHER Im not sure about Richard SARA EISEN What did you fight about RICHARD FISHER I was the funny side SARA EISEN the most at the Fed STANLEY FISCHER Rich Richard was unique LAUGH So Im not sure how to describehis style But it was always a pleasure to listen to him That much was that much was sure The I suspect that the decision to publish verbatim transcripts within five years has made a huge difference And the other fact which you should know is a majority of the board cannot meet and discuss anything related to economics without its being declared a formal meeting of the board and minutes being taken So now that there are three of them now there are four they get SARA EISEN Waiting for confirmation RICHARD FISHER They can meet whenever they want STANLEY FISCHER No they well they cant Because yo RICHARD FISHER Its three outta seven isnt it STANLEY FISCHER you need somebody to take the minutes RICHARD FISHER Oh thats true Thats right STANLEY FISCHER So you cant sit around a table SARA EISEN Are you breaking Fed did you break some Fed rules STANLEY FISCHER Richard yes You mustve broken the rules RICHARD FISHER Well I was not part of that inner crowd But this is an important point that Stan makes They arent heated conversations The level of intellectual discourse of course I dont have a PhD in economics always is just fantastic And I do think the fact that youre someones gonna read your transcripts now millionsll read yours Maybe my children will read mine Im not quite sure But I was always mindful of the fact that someone will read this eventually I dont wanna look like an idiot And I wanted to put a good joke in there every now and then But its a very s civilized conversation And the press likes to make it sound like its combative Its not Its a group of people doing their level best to get it right And they come from different perspectives SARA EISEN Richard is Jay Powell a hawk or a dove RICHARD FISHER I dont like that nomenclature SARA EISEN You I think youve called yourself a hawk RICHARD FISHER Well I was a hawk because doves come from the pigeon family And I dont wanna be anybodys pigeon So but I think hes a pragmatist And I never liked in that aviary that they put us in I never liked that ornithological distinction STANLEY FISCHER No thats RICHARD FISHER Wise owl STANLEY FISCHER Thats RICHARD FISHER This is the wise owl STANLEY FISCHER This I think Im not an an ornithologist or anything But I think owls have some dirty habits RICHARD FISHER Eating mice for example STANLEY FISCHER I wouldnt accuse Jay of being in the least bit dirty on anything And I disagree on yes its very valuable that the transcripts be published When I was in the Bank of Israel and we introduced the transcript notion with a new constitution the one of the guys said Well how can I face my grandchildren if theyre gonna read this Well 25 years later you can probably say I was younger then or something like that and less wise than you are today But five years means you may still be on the board when its published RICHARD FISHER Thats right STANLEY FISCHER And I didnt find that very useful And the word on among the people there is that the quality of the discussion declined or at least intensity declined with that decision to publish the transcript so quickly And its very the whole setup is kind of anti what I think a committee should be like where people sit around RICHARD FISHER Exchange STANLEY FISCHER and talk to each other freely SARA EISEN Its stilted Its STANLEY FISCHER It becomes SARA EISEN Formal STANLEY FISCHER stilted yeah SARA EISEN S Fed governor term actually is 14 years So I know you both approve of the presidents choices of respected economists to serve as governors But it is pretty unusual to have so much turnover to have so many spots and to have a president reshape the Fed Richard I just wonder if you can really bank on any continuity in monetary policy with such a different STANLEY FISCHER Excuse me can SARA EISEN shape okay go ahead STANLEY FISCHER I interject SARA EISEN You may Go STANLEY FISCHER something The term runs for 14 years But you dont get appointed for 14 years RICHARD FISHER Thats right STANLEY FISCHER You get appointed for the number of years that remain in the term So the term is a period SARA EISEN Everyones picking up each others terms STANLEY FISCHER Right And it was set up that a term expires every two years Cause when you started you had to not turn the whole board over every time you appointed one SARA EISEN Still this is RICHARD FISHER I mean not appointed as a chair SARA EISEN a totally different RICHARD FISHER for 14 years I think thats an important thing too I do think for example Randy Quarles firstrate appointment I mean he came out of Davis Polk He understands the super reg side one of the best practicing lawyers in that area And went in by the way married to Fed royalty Because Hope Eccles is his wife in a private equity group he was in in Utah But I think as Stan said earlier the appointments so far have been quite good The nominations have been quite good I just wish the Senate would process them so you could have a full board And thats up to the politicians But I give this president credit for at least nominating good people for the Federal Reserve apolitical people hopefully STANLEY FISCHER So Richard can I ask you I never served on a board with more than five members as far as I can recall RICHARD FISHER Thats why it was so efficient STANLEY FISCHER And many people said we did just fine with five RICHARD FISHER Yeah I think you did great STANLEY FISCHER Is that right RICHARD FISHER Yeah you did STANLEY FISCHER It would mean there could only be four presidents on the voting side RICHARD FISHER Now theres always five presidents on the voting side Cause New York Fed gets STANLEY FISCHER No thats now But if we went to a fiveperson board RICHARD FISHER Wed still be overwhelmed The presidents would still be overwhelmed SARA EISEN This is very technical STANLEY FISCHER Well you wanted inside baseball didnt you RICHARD FISHER Its a very exciting group of people SARA EISEN Stan whatdo you think Chairman Powells biggest challenge is going to be as he takes over this new term STANLEY FISCHER I think almost every chair or governor of a central bank anywhere finds himself facing a crisis within two or three years And the big challenge will be how does he do in his first serious crisis Theres a phenomenally good staff there Theyre all the same He knows how to use a staff more than almost anyone else I mean he milks the staff for everything theyve got And theyve got a lot of information I very rarely found that I had to call outside the Fed if I had a question There was someone there who knew the treatment So I think thats his major challenge Other than that its the well were moving now into a period where were essentially where we would like to be inflation at 2 full employment over full employment Now weve gotta manage that SARA EISEN Where do you see a crisis lurking STANLEY FISCHER Listen I have two things for nevertoanswer question When you say They should open up the economy And they should free up imports Tell me what they going to produce for exports I say I dont have the foggiest Supposed youd announced that Chile would become an exporter of domestically grown salmon I wouldve looked at you like you were nuts I mean these are things the private sector figures out And they figure them out better than anybody like me can say it So dont answer that question cause you dont know And on the crises they come from unexpected places You have to know how crises have been handled Jay has a considerable advantage in having been there for a large part of this the last crisis But you had better not expect that the next crisis will be the same as this one And the first crisis I was in was a Mexican crisis of 1994 95 And we were summoned to a meeting when we discovered there was a crisis at 600 in the morning And the thenhead of the IMF s Camdessus said Gentlemen and they were all gentlemen in those days Gentlemen this is a crisis And in a crisis you do not panic Let us get down to work And thats RICHARD FISHER Those were the orders STANLEY FISCHER Those were the orders And wegot down to work And dont think that theres something super special about this one and youve gotta do this Youve gotta do that first There is a procedure SARA EISEN Well Richard you warned you were sounding the alarms on housing pretty early inside the Fed RICHARD FISHER Yeah but we didnt really none of us saw how deep and awful it was gonna be But again Ben now you werent there Stan but I think it was channeling your wisdom in that he taught Ben Bernanke SARA EISEN PhD advisor right thesis advisor RICHARD FISHER But then you know we huddled down We all again rode together We had different philosophical views about monetary policy But at that point we just had to be together And we had video conference night after night after night for 18 months But I think Stans right You dont know what you never know where a black swans gonna appear Thats why its called a black swan And you just have to pull together to solve the crisis I do think what theyre doing now I look at the policy now The 2 intermediateterm inflation targets very important But theyre roughly there You can overshoot it for a while You can undershoot it We know that pressures are beginning to build a little bit in the commodities cycle and on wages and salaries Its not out of control But we are long in the cycle The record is ten years March of 91 to March of 2001 Presumably therell be some propellant behind this with the fiscal policy that is the tax cuts inducement for capex and perhaps a better regulatory environment for private businesses than they had before But at some point the cycle turns And I from a risk management standpoint I think the object here is to get as many nuts in a tree as you can So get as many quarterpoint increases without disturbing the system SARA EISEN Are they going too slow RICHARD FISHER No I think you know this is the pace that theyve adopted Youre paring back the balance sheet We established the principle of using the balance sheet And you wanna have the toolkit to help mitigate a downturn That would be not a crisis But it would be a nice way to manage your way through this business cycle Cause at some point the business cycles not been conquered God hasnt conquered the business cycle And President Trump has not conquered the business cycle So you have to have the tools in place And lifting off a zero bound as theyre doing I think as deliberately as theyre doing it is the right policy to pursue And I expect it to continue for quite a while if they can have the space to do it SARA EISEN Stan do you think this is gonna be a tricky task in normalizing raising interest rates now that we are starting to really see inflation take hold STANLEY FISCHER Well I mean seeing inflation taking hold when for the first time in how many years I dont know but a large number years Weve actually got as high as 2 I dont see inflation having taken hold And if inflation is gonna average 2 itll be above by a few percentage points from time to time And thatll be manageable SARA EISEN Youre not worried about it coming on fast and STANLEY FISCHER Im not worried about it now But the question is what decisions are they gonna make when circumstances change And youve gotta you will have a pretty wise group of people there assisted by a really very professional group of economists SARA EISEN So they have the tools What if we are turning in the business cycle and we go into a recession STANLEY FISCHER Well weve got a little bit of room to cut interest rates And theres QE which nobody likes but which works SARA EISEN Well especially this guy RICHARD FISHER No I was against QE3 But it was just a judgement I felt that we wanted to save a few our last bullet in our holster in case we did slip backwards I didnt think it was necessary at that time But I lost that argument And I think wiser heads prevailed But heres the point which were both underscoring Youve established that is a useful tool And you can revert to it if you need to You prefer not to But they are paring back 360 billion a year in treasuries 240 billion a year in as they get to the full run rate this October in mortgage backs That gives them some room to use the balance sheet if they have to You prefer not to SARA EISEN What do you think Stan about the idea of fiscal stimulus in the ninth year of an expansion STANLEY FISCHER Well Iwas not opposed to some fiscal stimulus Because I kept worrying about Rstar May I speak about Rstar in polite company SARA EISEN Sure STANLEY FISCHER You know it was the real interest rates that people are estimating as being the equilibrium interest rate for the long term short sorry the shortterm interest rate that people are estimating as equilibrium is very close to zero So in that sense we dont have a lot of room On the other hand the term structure typically slopes up It hasnt lately But it typically does And anything that typically happens is very likely to happen again Thats one of the reasons I couldnt really spend days and nights worrying about the Phillips Curve not working If you say Well if theres a lot of pressure on the demand for labor the price of labor goes up that seems to me like about the best economics you can get Yeah its demand and supply Its true And its happening But its not happening at any rapid speed yet And they can raise interest rates And then if we do get into a recession they can cut interest rates and as I said as Richard says we could go if we have to to QE SARA EISEN Weve seen some volatility in the markets lately RICHARD FISHER Thats good SARA EISEN ever since February Do you think that that is because of the Fed or because of President Trump RICHARD FISHER So be just as we were getting I have a colleague some of my colleagues from Barclays in here But Nick Howard heard me say this Just before Christmas I heard a term when I was visiting hedge fund and other money managers here in New York and in London metastability SARA EISEN Meta RICHARD FISHER And I turned to Nick Howard and said this meansWere on the verge of great volatility I mean look we had a oneway street And part of this was in my view we engineered this deliberately Remember the SampP bottomed at what I call the Book of Revelations number 666 right first week of March 2009 And what we wanted to do was create a wealth effect Clearly when you drive rates to zero hammer down a yield curve so real rates are zero it changes the way you can discount future cash flows present value So we a rally was engineered I think it worked very well I SARA EISEN Youre one of the few people that admits that the Fed was trying to engineer a stock market rally RICHARD FISHER Not so much that as we were basically trying to create a wealth effect and hopefully get things started again We were at rock bottom STANLEY FISCHER Listen hesnot known as a moderate But hes giving you the moderate position And youre taking the position of Richard Fisher Im not sure you should be doing that RICHARD FISHER But I do SARA EISEN hes just trying to be provocative RICHARD FISHER No but I mean we had a oneway street for so long that its I think its healthy Otherwise you create a maldistribution of investment assets And we were shoving things into a highrisk corner Usually you pick up yield by movin out the yield curve You cant do that So instead youre going into highrisk categories And Im not surprised this went on for so long metastability whatever that meant It was a key tipoff It wasnt gonna last And I think this is returning to normal in my view And I think its a healthy thing SARA EISEN Is it healthy Stan STANLEY FISCHER Yeah I mean you say that we didnt I wasnt there We didnt admit that we were trying to get stock prices up Well we were trying to get the prices of things that are reproducible up so that people would produce those things And part of that hope was for housing which didnt respond that quickly Thats typically where monetary policy works And that took RICHARD FISHER Thats right STANLEY FISCHER a long time But I would say I wasnt there when Ben was managing it But certainly as Janet was managing it the process was managed very well And this is requires a lot of management of expectations And there was Janet as calm as you can be I thought that Janet was superb in dealing with the public dealing with the Congress Because shes tough as hell as nails And she doesnt look it So you know here comes this nice person walking along And you say something stupid And she says Well thats not the way it works Senator And then she explains And she does this with a nice smile And she speaks beautifully Thats great That was wonderful management of expectations But we knew people like Richard and others knew we had cut interest rates to as low as we thought then they could go It turns out they can go a bit lower And stock prices went up like heck Well if we were gonna normalize interest rates that relationship had to get restored to normal somewhere at some point when people were confident that we didnt need the very low interest rates and so forth Were there now And that switch in which the premium on the stock the equity premium returns could be a difficult one It was difficult We were all sure wed seen it early in February this year And then it went away as quickly as it came But and were getting somewhere there But weve still got a flat yield curve and will eventually go up But and that could be a difficult period But there are things which anybody who sort of looked at the underlying economics would know that was going to happen And they happen You cant say they happen on schedule So they happen at some point RICHARD FISHER Including fiscal stimulus We were hoping wed get some help from the fiscal side and the regulatory side You know you have to give I wanna come back to Janet and Ben You have to give em credit We were the only players in town We had no help from the other side none And this is a late package late in the cycle Id rather have it in terms of a treatment of capex than not have it at all But I wish we had had it earlier or some variation The counter to that is of course running up the debt and the borrowing schedule for the treasury And thats a little conflict at a time obviously when the Feds withdrawing from being a major purchaser of securities SARA EISEN So how would you rate President Trumps economic policy so far Richard RICHARD FISHER Im gonna let Stan answer that STANLEY FISCHER So let me just I thought a little with Rstar being so low I sort of made a nuisance of myself by saying its not only monetary policy that affects the interest rate Its also fiscal policy And we could do with some help from fiscal policy to get Rstar up Namely an expansionary fiscal policy would raise the equilibrium interest rate Well they did it And they did too much of it I think is the answer But SARA EISEN The tax cuts or STANLEY FISCHER Whatever the fiscal stimulus was It was tax cuts And there were a whole host of other things as well There was too much of it But having some of it which I think is exactly what Richard just said seems to me to have been a good idea And you know and then there are the issues about whos getting the tax cuts and all that sort of stuff which is more into political side of things But I thought some of what we got was justified SARA EISEN What about trade Both of you I would guess would characterize yourselves as free traders RICHARD FISHER Well I was deputy of USTR SARA EISEN Right You worked on a little thing called NAFTA RICHARD FISHER And I did do the protocol negotiations for Chinas succession of the WTO And Ive gotten a kick outta the secretary of commerce almost using scatological terms to describe what Charlene Barshefsky and I did But other than that Im putting it aside And you know the steel industry every president democrat or republican including I was Bill Clintons deputy trade rep We used 232 and 301 Republican and democrat theres something about steel even though the people that use steel to fabricate products is a multiple of maybe 20 of those that manufacture steel But for some reason that always appeals I hate to see these measures being taken And I believe that globalization is best procured and advanced through as much free trade as possible Now if people cheat you have remedies And I do think China has been taking advantage But I really am a believer even Winston Churchill who wasnt a great minister until he became prime minister in the war basically said you know l Let them dump into our markets We will take the value added and profit from it We do that here If you really look at where the profits are its at the high valueadded end So that advances our economy Were a high valueadded economy And I really am my one great criticism I may have many but the strongest of this administration is I do not like protectionism And it creates again a distortion in markets in the real economy And it also has inflationary influences which I dont think are necessary SARA EISEN So you dont buy the idea that its just a negotiation Art of the Deal tactic to get more fair trade for American business RICHARD FISHER I do think its a negotiating tactic He does remember Ross Perots term gorilla dust Thats sort of the way this president seems to negotiate things beating his chest and so on And it may be very effective Well see Just a sidebar I hope its very effective in the case of the Koreas And Im perfectly willing to give him enormous credit for that if it works But on trade I think you have to be very very careful Because we all know the path that protectionism leads us down And its a destructive path SARA EISEN Who has more to lose US or China RICHARD FISHER Stan SARA EISEN He defers all the tough ones to you STANLEY FISCHER This is called batting cleanup RICHARD FISHER I just wanna get him to say STANLEY FISCHER I dont know who has more to lose China certainly has accumulated a considerable amount of economic gain from this period so far Given how far theyve got whether they will accumulate more than the United States I dont know I mean when youve got a nonzerosum game and both sides can gain well you dont have to spend a lot of time figuring out who wins more I mean politically I can see people like you and me and Sara discussing who won more But all they want is to say Youre better off because I did this RICHARD FISHER Exactly I do think autos steel l these are shortterm issues The real issue with China is 5G the new and whats called a latency SARA EISEN You must be on the board of a telecom company RICHARD FISHER Well I am on the board of ATampT But this is what this is all about And there was a moment by the way in this administration that our government was gonna deal with that and take it away from the private companies Verizon ATampT and so on which we know would not be the right solution But you have a control freak in China in Xi Jinping And theyre moving they dont have the infrastructure that we inherited here with copper wires even fiber and certain say credit cards and so on Theyre skipping an entire generation So theyre pressing this quite a bit And they do steal intellectual property My alma mater Harvard is the secondmostattacked target by two Red Army divisions Probably MIT would be first But we know what they do And its unfair playing But thats the nature of the world we live in And thats what this race is all about as far as Im who wins in cyberspace And thatll determine who gets the best of the other team SARA EISEN Stan how dowhat do you think when you read some of the headlines every day on trade and the presidents tactics and the potential for a trade war STANLEY FISCHER Well I mean the you know I prefer people who give the impression that are meek and mild We dont have a president like that And the danger is that he will actually believe some of the things that he says Now when he says Trade wars are easy to win well yeah maybe But I dont believe that And I think the amount of damage you can do because you can go into the structure of trade and screw up every industry if youre really good at it And I worry enormously about that And I was not encouraged by the fact that here we are theres a theory that we need to change the economy Whats the first thing we do Tariffs 1930 whats the first thing we do RICHARD FISHER Tariffs STANLEY FISCHER SmootHawley tariff Didnt work That gave us Keynesianism So maybe something good will come out of this thing Cause the tariff thing wont work unless at some point and this seems to me entirely possible the president will say Okay Ive done enough and move on to saying Okay weve got a new equilibrium What you said I think there certainly must be some element of this being tactics if not all of it being tactics And SARA EISEN Because its just too awful to think about if he goes through with it STANLEY FISCHER Well its not too awful Because you have to think about it But its pretty miserable to think about living in that world after all the work that went on to not do that I once listened to somebody whod been around in Italy after World War II And he said One of the reasons we were in favor of free trade was we knew the government couldnt manage an economy that had free trade And we didnt want a government that would manage the economy And thats because theres so much going on And prices are changing And everything like that is happening And thats by and large good I mean there are aspects of it occasionally that you need to correct And yes I worry about that But Im a little bit relieved about the fact that some of this is clearly bargaining tactics SARA EISEN Bluster RICHARD FISHER They used to say about the music of the German composer Richard Wagner His musics not as bad as it sounds Im hopeful that this president isnt as bad as he sounds SARA EISEN Thats a good one RICHARD FISHER Thank you SARA EISEN What would happen to the stock market if we saw an escalation RICHARD FISHER Of what S

30,31,"Move Over, Skinny Mannequins. Stores Give Plus-Size Clothes More of the Floor",Retailers including Nordstrom and Target are boosting their plus-size offerings and displaying the clothing next to standard sizes.,https://www.wsj.com/articles/move-over-skinny-mannequins-stores-give-plus-size-clothes-more-of-the-floor-1525784400,2018-05-08 13:00:02,Americans are getting bigger and retailersafter years of ignoring plussize shoppersare starting to notice Chains including Nordstrom Inc JWN 196 and Target Corp TGT 242 are boosting their plussize offerings and displaying the clothing next to standard sizes breaking with a practice of segregating larger sizes in a separate department often hidden away at the back of the store The chains are adding supersize mannequins and some are even showcasing plussize models on their websites alongside the usual waiflike figures Fashion has long cultivated a body image that was out of alignment with most Americans But the discrepancy is growing making it harder for retailers to ignore as they grapple with rising competition from Amazoncom Inc and other online retailers that has cut into sales and led to the closure of hundreds of stores More than 70 of US adults age 20 and older were overweight or obese as of 2014 according to government health statistics That compares with 665 a decade before The mean waist size for American women age 20 and older was 38 inches according to the data which equates to a size 16 for most brands Regular sizes typically start at 2 and run through 12 with plussizes starting at 14 Men are getting bigger too Target offers some Big amp Tall clothing for them next to regular sizes in select stores And Nordstrom is hoping to have a bigger selection of plus sizes for men next year But for the most part retailers are testing these changes in their womens departments Nordstrom is adding larger sizes from 100 brands many of which previously had not made plussize clothing including Italian luxury brand Gucci The extended sizes will be available online and in 30 stores alongside the regularsize clothing for each brand and displayed on mannequins ranging in size from 2 to 18 Target by yearend will carry plussize swimsuits athletic gear and lingerie next to regularsize items in those categories in 300 stores up from about 150 stores currently More than 1000 locations will have mannequins spanning size 4 to 22 Outdoor chain REI increased its plussize offerings by 50 during the past year Sixteen of its 153 stores now display larger sizes next to regularsize parkas and other gear There werent many outdoor brands that made larger sizes said Michele Orr REIs general merchandise manager of apparel We had to convince them by explaining the business opportunity The moves are a departure for an industry that plussize shoppers say makes them feel like secondclass citizens Plussize clothes are often at the back of the store the departments arent well stocked and the experience is so uninviting said Amanda Gilliam a collegeadmissions consultant in Somerset NJ Its very shortsighted of brands not to make plussizes They are missing out on so many people who are prepared to spend money Some brands have shied away from manufacturing larger sizes because of the expense and complication of getting the clothes to fit In standard clothing the length and width increase proportionally for each successive size according to industry executives In plussizes the width increases more than the length requiring manufactures to create new fit patterns which is costly Larger sizes also require additional fabric which adds another layer of expense though clothing producers often pass many of these costs on to consumers There are costs associated with having extended sizes and lots of brands just arent interested said Emma Grede who with Klo Kardashian founded Good American a denim and Tshirt brand that runs the size gamut from 00 to 24 Nordstrom began carrying Good American in October and noticed that 16 and 18 were among the bestselling sizes Most of the other denim brands Nordstrom sells didnt make jeans in those sizes so it asked them to expand their range according to Tricia Smith Nordstroms generalmerchandise manager of womens apparel Soon it had enlisted other brands including Rag amp Bone and Theory which added sizes 14 and 16 Nordstrom is adding sizes at the lower end too down to 00 And like Target it isnt eliminating its plussize departments though that is something Ms Smith said she would consider if she could get enough brands to produce largersize clothes There is still a lot of work to be done she said For instance the largersize mannequins had to be custom made because the standard mannequin size is a 2 Not all plussize shoppers want their clothes integrated with regular sizes Id prefer to have a separate department because it makes it easier to find what Im looking for said Veronica Miranda who lives in San Francisco and is studying earlychildhood education She said she would welcome any moves that added more stylish clothing in her size Its really hard to find current styles she added With the pickings slim some retailers have begun producing the clothes themselves Target introduced Ava amp Viv in 2015 an inhouse plussize brand whose spring lineup includes offthe shoulder tops and floral dresses Since then it has increased its privatelabel plussize offerings by 50 with the launch of new lines that sell both large and regular sizes according to a spokeswoman REI started working with outdoor brand Khl to produce plus sizes about a year ago The brand previously hadnt made plussize clothing but added sizes up to XXXL It also began buying plussize performance apparel from Shebeest and other brands To lend authenticity to its marketing the company reached out to plussize influencers such as Jenny Bruso who writes a blog REI sponsors some of her blog posts and group hikes that she hosts around Portland Ore Ms Bruso said she started hiking six years ago but had trouble finding the appropriate wardrobe The outdoor brands werent making plussize clothes or else they were matronly and unflattering Ms Bruso said Or they were only available online which sends the message that they dont want us shopping in their stores Write to Suzanne Kapner at SuzanneKapnerwsjcom

223,224,Cooperman: Two changes that could help fix what is wrong with our regulatory process,"Billionaire hedge fund manager Leon Cooperman addresses the SEC case against his firm, which he settled last year.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/22/leon-cooperman-two-changes-that-could-help-fix-what-is-wrong-with-our-regulatory-process.html,2018-05-22 11:02:00,First and foremost I am neither soliciting nor deserve anyones pity I have lived and prospered from the American Dream A firstgeneration American I was raised in a South Bronx walkup by my Polish immigrant parents attended New York City public schools through college and graduated from Columbia Business School in 1967 with a negative net worth and a young child at home div gt divgroup gt pfirstchildgt I rose through the ranks at Goldman Sachs amp Co which I left in late 1991 to launch Omega Advisors Inc the hedge fund firm where I together with 32 colleagues still work Fortunate beyond my wildest expectations I am a signatory to the BuffettGates Giving Pledge and I expect to donate not half but substantially all of my financial wealth to charity upon my death One of my guiding principles has long been that as generally attributed to Andrew Carnegie a man who dies rich dies disgraced and I have tried to arrange my affairs so that this can never be said of me As you may know last spring Omega and I settled a case brought by the SEC against us in September 2016 alleging various violations of federal securities laws We settled because doing so saved us what were projected to be enormous legal costs and a substantial diversion of time and attention over possibly years more of legal wrangling had we gone to trial I am still conflicted over that decision but it is water under the bridge I am writing this to express my indignation at the egregious manner in which the agency conducted its investigation of my firm and me As part of our settlement we entered into no admit no deny consents that prohibit us from publicly contesting the basis of the SECs case or the legitimacy of those allegations and from commenting on the specific facts of the case or on the merits of our defenses The outcome more below will have to speak for itself But I am free to express my views on how the agency handled this matter without violating those prohibitions Just to be clear I acknowledge the vital role that the SEC plays in policing the public securities markets in the United States and ensuring their integrity Without the vigorous discharge of that oversight function public faith in those markets would suffer and they could not operate smoothly My issue is not with the principle but with its application When the agency issued broad subpoenas to Omega and me in March 2015 I promptly offered through our lawyers that if the subpoenas were withdrawn I would meet voluntarily with the Commission staff and attempt to address all their questions about the trading and filings at issue The subpoenas could always be reinstated if I could not satisfy them that nothing illicit was going on In that context I would have voluntarily tolled all relevant statutes of limitations so that the governments claims regarding Atlas Pipeline Partners APL the company at the heart of the case they later filed in particular would not run in the interim They refused my offer We commenced voluminous document production in response to the subpoenas running up millions of dollars in legal and datawarehousing costs That rolling production was substantially completed by the end of 2015 and the Wells notice followed in midMarch of the following year In September 2016 the SECs director of enforcement advised our counsel that the agency would not agree to settle without among other things an industry bar He must have realized that this would have been tantamount to an admission of wrongdoing effectively ending my otherwise spotless 50year career on Wall Street in disgrace That was a nonstarter for me and I rejected their offer The Commission promptly filed suit alleging most notably that we had traded in the securities of APL on the basis of material nonpublic information and less sensationally that we had failed to make timely filings of certain securities holdings but notably not in APL When we informed our investors capital outflows which ultimately aggregated to billions of dollars in assets under management accelerated Even after announcing in May 2017 the settlement terms to which both sides finally agreed  which included no industry or officeranddirector suspension or bar no admission of wrongdoing a financial payment that was roughly half the original ask an obeythelaw injunction and various compliance enhancements  we continued to bleed assets due in large part to the pall cast on us by the governments unproven allegations It seems that such damage once inflicted cannot be undone Adding salt to the wound while no admit no deny materially circumscribes what I can say about the case and its disposition it apparently doesnt tie the SECs hands to quite the same degree In a statement released to the press shortly after our settlement the agencys acting director of enforcement characterized the financial payment to which Omega and I had agreed as having been levied for our misconduct gratuitously omitting the word alleged even though since the case was settled the complaints allegations never had to be and were never proven in court I guess that allimportant distinction didnt mesh well with the agencys narrative At various points along the course of this saga our lawyers informed the agencys staff of the harm that these allegations were inflicting  on my business and on the professional prospects and earning opportunities of scores of honest innocent hardworking Omega employees  and of the protracted investigations potential implications for Omegas continued viability as a going concern Their entreaties fell on deaf ears Had the staff offered back in September 2016 to settle on the terms we ultimately agreed upon I would have accepted if only to preserve what then remained of my business and avoid the distraction and outsized expense of longdrawnout litigation but that deal was not then on the table Instead after the needless expenditure by both sides of financial and human resources of substantial magnitude my business is a fraction the size and profitability it was and the government got what it could have had for the asking eight or nine months earlier Is this any way to manage the affairs of an ostensibly preeminent US regulatory agency It seems logically manifest to me that something transpired between September 2016 and March 2017 that led to the Commissions dramatically downwardlyrevised settlement offer Despite numerous attempts to ferret it out I have been unsuccessful in getting a response either from the current chairman or from his predecessor who oversaw my case and who told me when I saw her at a conference after she left office that even innocent people often find settling with the government preferable to hazarding the system As an American taxpayer I believe that I deserve an answer to my question And as an analytical person it is hard for me to reconcile the significant bloodsport destruction of my business that this matter has occasioned without understanding the dynamics behind the resolution from the Commissions perspective But equally to the point now that its all over where do I go for redress My colleagues and I are left to pick up the pieces but as we do the words of Raymond Donovan Ronald Reagans former Labor Secretary and the first sitting cabinet officer to be indicted resonate with me Although his was a state criminal matter and mine a federal civil one the sentiment he expressed rings just as true here When he and his codefendants were acquitted at trial of all charges he said Its a cruel thing they did to me The question is should this indictment have ever been brought What office do I go to to get my reputation back Who will reimburse my company for the economic jail it has been in for twoandahalf years Different office of a different government but his questions are just as relevant today as they were 30 years ago Powerless to force an answer to my question it appears that Im expected like so many before me to just suck it up and move on Chalk up one more to regulatory unaccountability I wish I were wired that way Given the vast resources of the federal government and the prospect of potentially ruinous legal costs and collateral damage that confront any defendant it is little wonder that so many opt to throw in the towel and settle rather than risk the vagaries and expense of extended litigation In the end the regulators taxpayerfunded and shielded for the most part by sovereign immunity not meaningfully accountable to anyone but themselves pay no price for overreaching  a classic case of moral hazard On the civil side at least that is a deplorable situation that cries out for remediation My suggestions first that when the government sues an individual or firm and loses in court or before a regulatory tribunal the government reimburse its targets legal expenses to the extent not covered by insurance just as we as taxpayers already foot the governments bills and second that in cases like mine once the dust has settled and the jockeying for position has ended the government show its hand privately to its target and demonstrate why it thought it had a case to begin with These two changes  the first a matter of costshifting the second a matter of the salutary benefits of sunshine  might not solve all that is wrong with our regulatory process but they would be a good start

235,236,A Supreme Court Ruling Could Make Your Online Purchases More Expensive,It's a big win for brick-and-mortar retailers.,http://fortune.com/2018/06/21/supreme-court-sales-tax/,2018-06-21 15:59:20,In a close decision the Supreme Court on Thursday determined that states can force internet retailers to collect sales taxes from shoppers even in states where they have no physical presence handing traditional retailers and state governments a major victory For years brickandmortar chains have complained of an uneven battlefield in the ecommerce wars saying they had to charge and collect sales taxes everywhere while ecommerce rivals did not except in states where they had a physical presence such as a distribution center or a store The issue has also been an irritant to state governments deprived of billions of dollars a year at a time many are struggling to balance budgets The retail industry hailed the decision This ruling clears the way for a fair and level playing field where all retailers compete under the same sales tax rules whether they sell merchandise online instore or both National Retail Federation CEO Matt Shay said in a statement Shares in online retailers like Amazoncom amzn Wayfair w Etsy etsy Overstockcom ostk and eBay ebay all fell in the wake of the decision The Supreme Courts 54 decision overruled a 1992 ruling that found the Constitution didnt allow states to require businesses to collect sales taxes unless they have a substantial connection to the state But in recent years several Supreme Court justices suggested the moment was ripe to review the 1992 decision prompting South Dakota to pass a law forcing online stores to collect a 45 sales tax if sales and employee count hit a certain threshold And it sued Wayfair Overstockcom and Newegg which won in lower court decisions Rejecting the physical presence rule is necessary to ensure that artificial competitive advantages are not created by this courts precedents Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the courts decision in the case South Dakota v Wayfair The Court also found that the expansion of ecommerce has also increased the revenue shortfall faced by States seeking to collect their sales and use taxes One federal report estimated the shortfall in the aggregate to about 13 billion a year By and large traditional retailers have adjusted to the rise of Amazon and many such as Macys m Kohls kss and Nordstrom jwn get 20 of revenues online The likes of Walmart wmt and Target tgt have invested heavily in ecommerce and now garner billions of dollars in sales online But for a number of years during which Amazon built up its mammoth lead the different tax requirements gave online retailers an edge Amazon a frequent target of President Trumps over sales tax collection was not involved in the Supreme Court case It collects sales taxes on purchases made on its site from its own inventory but does not do so on behalf of thirdparty sellers selling products on its marketplaces platform In recent years Amazon has built distribution centers in many states and last year bought Whole Foods giving it a physical presence in many states anyway

107,108,Worried About Your Data Privacy? Blockchain Could Help,"Today, we give away our data to companies like Facebook for free.",http://fortune.com/2018/06/27/facebook-data-privacy-blockchain/,2018-06-27 15:14:56,Facebook FB could unwittingly be the worlds best advertisement for blockchain Even as the social media giant tries to shore up its privacy regime after data securities issues exposed the data of about 3 million users privacy and security are likely to dog italong with every other Internetbased company The good news is there may be a silver lining The constant drumbeat of highprofile hacks of companies like Facebook Target TGT and Equifax could accelerate the tipping point when the public embraces the notion that the Internet we depend on is truly broken and when alternatives like blockchain gain greater acceptance And the sooner that happens the better The problem with the public Internet is that its architecture and our desire for privacy are utterly incompatible With every highprofile hack that becomes more obvious The network of computers we call the Internet operates as a giant copyandpaste machinecopying information from one computer and pasting it to another when transferring data When we share vital information such as our name date of birth address and social security number that sensitive data is passed to thirdparty companies that require it This creates two additional problems We have to repeatedly fill out forms every time we interact with a new organization and the firms that make copies and store our information in centralized databases are easy targets for hackers With data proliferating rapidly it seems unlikely that the problem will improve without a new approach The Internet generates 25 quintillion bytes of data each day and 90 of all the data in the world was created in the last two years alone A new approach that could help is distributed ledger technology DLT A distributed ledger or a public blockchain such as Ethereum acts very differently from the Internet Rather than making copies from one computer and pasting them to another when transferring information with the blockchain there is a transfer of ownership of the original information The publicprivate architecture of a blockchain clearly defines and improves the privacy of data in a digital format online Blockchain technology creates counterfeitproof information on a network we can trust Instead of sharing our date of birth again and again we have one permanent record of this information on the blockchain and then give temporary permission to access the official record when needed In this system public information such as tax records government records and local school budgets can remain public while the private data of citizens and corporations can be private and secure This approach turns our current digital economy on its head Today we give away our data to companies like Facebook for free and they monetize that information without sharing their revenues In a blockchain system your data is your own and only you have the private keys and ability to access this information Then you can share and monetize that data as you wish For example a bank might ask customers for access to their data to learn more about shopping and payment patterns perhaps offering an incentive to share that information such as loyalty program points or a lower credit card interest rate Today questions of privacy often come down to a blanket request of agreeing or disagreeing to sharing data In a blockchain environment sharing our data will become more granular specific and secure A study by Doug Galen of the Stanford Graduate School of Business says the promise of blockchain is based on four attributes its ability to enable transparency of data to ensure that data is tamperproof to mitigate counterparty risk in transactions and to create and manage digital identities It will take time to realize this promise but with billions of dollars deployed to develop blockchainfor instance at least 13 billion had been invested by venture capitalists in just the first few months of 2018theres much to look forward to even in the next two years Were already seeing

YouTube star to draw in gaggles of other pintsized shoppers clamoring for bubble pets Tshirts and capsules full of limegreen slime On Monday the store chain will debut Ryans World a toy and Tshirt line created by the firstgrader whose YouTube channel Ryan ToysReview gets roughly 950 million views a month Among kids clearly whats emerged in the last few years is theyre watching an influencer like Ryan on YouTube and hes their authority says Anne Marie Kehoe Walmarts vice president and divisional merchandise manager of toys Thats why we thought this was something to really move fast on More from USA Today How social media has shaped Black Lives Matter five years later Instagram testing feature that lets users remove followers YouTuber Liza Koshy gets her own series At a time when traditional retailers are struggling to woo shoppers established brands and chains such as Walmart Nordstrom and Target are increasingly collaborating with social media stars to create collections build buzz and get realtime feedback on what shoppers think is  and isnt  cool Theyre not just going with a big celebrity face anymore says Priyanka Dayal senior content marketing manager for Celebrity Intelligence which connects businesses to social media influencers and celebrities Were seeing that retailers are adopting new tactics to reach out to the younger generation Starting this fall Nordstrom will carry a new clothing line created by Arielle Charnas the popular lifestyle influencer behind the Something Navy blog who is checking with her millionplus followers to finetune details ranging from fabrics to colors Target looked for input from Gen Z trendsetters for its clothing line Art Class which launched last year And Kohls works with wellness influencers through the site mindbodygreen The growing clout of influencers is on vivid display through the growth of Beautycon which showcases the latest in beauty products and trends Since its first meeting five years ago when a group of YouTube personalities gathered to trade favorite products and beauty tips Beautycon has grown to include events in New York and London as well as Los Angeles This years twoday gathering in California which featured a chat between CEO Moj Mahdara and social media queen Kim Kardashian was Beautycons largest Some 500 influencers took part among the 32000 attendees and more than 200 brands were represented Beautycon spokeswoman Emily Taylor says Now is the first time ever that your nextdoor neighbor could have a million followers on Instagram says Justin Kline founder of Markerly an influencer research company that acts as a matchmaker for brands and social media trendsetters Its opened up this whole new world of people who have access to this huge following which is really great for brands because it allows them to harness all this clout Initially it was mostly smaller brands eager to make their mark in the world of ecommerce that tended to turn to personalities on YouTube and Instagram for attention But oldschool retailers are also recognizing that when it comes to connecting with Generations Y and Z whose household spending is in the billions of dollars a recommendation from someone they relate to can have far more sway than that of an actor or pop star Research conducted in 2016 by influencer marketing firm Collective Bias which is now owned by tech company Inmar found 30 percent of shoppers were more inclined to buy a product endorsed by a blogger they viewed as a peer than a celebrity And among those 18 to 34 years old 70 percent preferred the noncelebrity Additionally nearly six out of 10 shoppers had taken a social media or blog review into account while browsing in a store Someone who is a teacher is looking for what other teachers have in their classrooms says Allison Stone consumer markets manager with consultancy PwC This is their lifestyle what they do every day It comes from pure experience and it feels more authentic The legions of kids who click onto Ryan ToysReview are able to have what amounts to a virtual play date with its namesake tagging along as he treks through Legoland Japan meets Sponge Bob and tries out assorted toys and activities Last year Ryanwhose family will not share his last name  was the youngest on Forbes list of the highestpaid YouTube personalities generating an estimated 11 million in 2017 Now starting in August kids will have a chance to buy toys and Tshirts that Ryan picked or helped design Its the first time that a child YouTube star has created their own line of clothing and toys Walmart says Nordstrom is also putting an influencercreated collection on its shelves Last September the retailer collaborated with popular lifestyle and fashion blog Something Navy to offer a capsule collection of clothing shoes and accessories The line Treasure amp Bond x SomethingNavy sold so well that the upscale department store chain says it will now offer a new Something Navy brand this fall Charnas the woman behind Something Navy has more than 1 million followers on Instagram alone and Nordstrom is counting on learning a lot from the readymade focus group that she has at her fingertips Arielle has been sharing different elements of the brand including fabric swatches color inspiration and sketches with her followers for feedback Nordstrom said in a statement Were listening to what theyre saying and are referencing their responses as we design the brand Arielle has developed a strong following and were hoping the synergy between both our brand and the Something Navy audience will introduce new customers to Nordstrom In addition to driving traffic toward a particular store or brand influencers also create content whether its photos on Instagram a video on YouTube or musings on a blog that companies can reuse Kline says This content is quite valuable to a retailer or other company he says Youre getting these eyeballs but also content which you can repurpose in other marketing materials And it might be easier to assess the value of an influencers impact than that of a celebrity ambassador who lends their face to a TV ad One thing for sure is that influencers provide statistics and evidence of clickthroughs sales likes and engagement rates says Louise Roe a TV host and lifestyle blogger who has worked with a mix of brands and retailers including Macys and Jimmy Choo So a company can really track their investment The impact of a star on a billboard is harder to measure with such accuracy Paid posts may be suspect to some shoppers who increasingly want to see a real connection between influencers and the products they promote Roe says that she discloses such arrangements and tries to keep a balance between sponsored and nonsponsored content Last year Target turned to a group of young teens and tweens to help it design its Gen Z focused clothing line Art Class The retailer also works with social media mavens to build connections with shoppers Influencers are an important part of how we reach our guests but our focus is on investing in relationships not transactions says Rick Gomez Targets chief marketing officer That means working directly with influencers who understand and love our brand and who can connect authentically with our guests on Targets behalf We also closely measure the work we do with influencers to ensure its effective in helping achieve the goals we establish

246,247,How Target Keeps Its ‘Tar-zhay’ Luster,Its own brands are the key.,http://fortune.com/2018/08/22/target-private-label/,2018-08-22 04:01:21,At a hip event space in downtown Manhattan Target tgt in early August Chief Merchant Mark Tritton was marveling at the merchandise from its three newly launched brands From electronics to apparel designed and manufactured by the retailer the items ran a wide spectrum of categories aimed at a whole new cohort of potential customers They were Heydey its first proprietary electronics brand Wild Fable a lowcost clothing and accessories brand for teenage and young adult women and Original Use a malefocused brand with an urban feel Tritton who came to Target from Nordstrom jwn two years ago with a mandate from CEO Brian Cornell to overhaul Targets private brand business a key ingredient in what sets it apart from Walmart and Amazon has now overseen the genesis and launch of 12 Target brands with more to come an unprecedented pace for that chain Its core to who we are Tritton tells Fortune at Targets Design Center in Manhattans Chelsea district The company had let a number of its brands grow tired in recent years and getting the part of the business that makes Target Tarzhay back on track was key Luckily for Target its always been quite good at creating a lineup of brands that are instantly recognizable by shoppers even those who dont frequent Target In just one year after launch in 2016 its kids apparel line Cat amp Jack was a mammoth 2 billion brand roughly as big as Lululemon Athletica It has enjoyed similar success in home goods like Pillowfort mens clothes such as Goodfellow amp Co which has an unmistakable JCrew feeling and Opalhouse an eclectic brand of home decor items Theyve always been very good at understanding trend and being able to tailor the trend to their broad audience says Wendy Liebmann CEO of WSL Strategic Retail That has always been Targets secret sauce borrowing the best elements of department stores and applying it to a discount big box Having unique products that have a strong enough identity for shoppers is essential to keep Target on the comeback trail the retailer has reported a number of quarter of sales increases and more importantly store visit growth is picking up thanks in large part to its store brands Those recognizable names help a shopper who can buy Tide detergent at any number of store chains to choose Target because they can get something there they cant elsewhere Now there is additional urgency to succeeding here with Amazoncom amzn going all in with its own brands and Walmart entering the fray with purpose Research by Coresite Research in December found that Amazon Fashion has grown to the point it now tied with Target as the second largest US apparel seller with 373 of Americans having shopped for clothes at there in the last month just a few percentage points behind Walmart There was no data for home goods another core part of Targets private brand strategy Others are doubling down too seeing the need to have more exclusive product and more control over what they sell and when Macys wants its private brands and other exclusive products to generate 40 of sales in a few years up from 29 last year while JC Penney wants to take that up to 70 from about half now And this past winter Walmart long known for the most basic flairfree clothes dramatically updated its apparel lines with items like polo pique shirts and shorts with lobster logos going well beyond the cheap basics and showcasing these brands at an event in Manhattans fashion district in an unusually high profile event for the chain As Deanah Baker Walmarts senior vice president of apparel for Walmarts US division quipped to Fortune at the time I cant make an outfit out of underwear socks and tees Of course private brands for the sake of private brands is not a winning strategy Shoppers have to want the items and therefore retailers have to treat them like brands and not just items they sell When Tritton got started he found brands that were adrift that encompassed too many items and themes and therefore didnt stand out in shoppers minds Take Merona and Mossimo those enormous and once very popular brands felt dated Rather than try to update them Target decided to start from scratch and junk them potentially losing billions in sales but giving itself a clean slate We took a long hard look at our portfolio and said This feels old that feels dated says Tritton And its hard to revitalize brands look at how much JC Penney and Kohls have had to work to rejig their St Johns Bay and Sonoma lines respectively Indeed Kohls found a few years ago that it had gone too far in the direction of its own brands versus socalled national brands like Nike nke and Levis after years of ramping up the percentage of sales from its own products lured by the higher margins This week it reported that its own brands had enjoyed their best quarter in five years Kohls has reversed course in the last two years and found great success in focusing on national brands drawing in new ones for the chain like Under Armour and finding the sweet spot in the breakdown of its brands and national brands was about halfhalf Changing up the merchandise is not enough on its own To jazz up instore shopping Target has hired so called visual merchandisers to give an almost department store caliber presentation of its own brands with mannequins that showcase an outfit rather than just stacking products in tall piles And lest we forget Target and others have erased layers of bureaucracy to facilitate all this Target as well as others have sped up production time something easier to do with their own brands so they can jump into or out of trends more quickly Streamlining brands also helps so their identity doesnt get muffled Macys reduced its assortment within its private brands last year to focus on making the items that remain more remarkable and eliminated duplication in different brands adding embellishments and better fabrics Macys CEO Jeff Gennette recently told Fortune The gold standard is for a customer not to know a private brand is not a national brand It might seem like splitting hairs to explain the difference between a private brand and a mere private label But with the carnage in retail particularly on the apparel side there is ample opportunity for Tritton to grab for more market share And entails focusing on giving its products true personality and not just pale imitations of national brands We want to be great storytellers as retailers and thats where retail is going says Tritton

22,23,Tiffany's $250 Million Bet on a 78-Year-Old Store,"In an internet age, why are companies pouring so much money into brick-and-mortar shops? Because the customers are still coming.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiffanys-250-million-bet-on-a-78-year-old-store-1535774938,2018-09-01 04:09:00,The famous Tiffany building on the corner of 5th Avenue and 57th Street where Audrey Hepburns Holly Golightly mused nothing very bad could happen to you in 1961 may be the most enduring example of what retailing looked like before the Internet arrived So its striking that the Tiffany TIF 037 amp Co of 2018 faced with an onslaught of online commerce is responding by making a big bet on that old store Its investing as much as 250 million in the 78yearold flagship It turns out that all over the ravaged retailing sector companies are rethinking the mantra that the future is digital and pouring money into actual brickandmortar stores Target Corp TGT 022 for instance has committed 7 billion to upgrade operations and while the Minneapolis retailer hasnt disclosed how much of that will go to improving physical locations a spokeswoman said stores are an incredibly important linchpin Why Because the bulk of Americas retail is still done the oldfashioned way Target has consistently increased online sales but ecommerce represents less than 6 of its revenues Online sales are closer to 7 at Home Depot but under 4 at Walmart The fading relevance of onetime icons like Kmart RadioShack and Toys R Us has taught executives that starving stores of investment is a recipe for obsolescence Tiffany amp Co Chief Executive Alessandro Bogliolo hired to run the jewelry giant in October is selling investors on his storerenovation message Representing as much as 10 of the companys 42 billion in annual net sales the flagship pulls in as much revenue as Pinterest Hes also working on the brands image and appeal to younger buyers Hes overseen fresh launches like the new Paper Flowers line a highend fine jewelry collection Tiffany commissioned rapper AAP Ferg and Elle Fanning to remix Moon River the song featured in Ms Hepburns film Breakfast at Tiffanys And Mr Bogliolo is aiming to improve the companys online presence Tiffany products are now available via Alibabas Tmall Netaportercom and Farfetchcom in addition to Tiffanycom But ultimately Tiffany lives and dies by the performance of 320 stores that deliver more than 90 of the companys revenue Its a magic place where as a customer you want to have an experience that is extraordinary Mr Bogliolo said Wednesday sitting beneath a portrait of Charles Lewis Tiffany at the companys flagship To be sure Mr Bogliolo is not selling paper towels Tshirts or other commodities that can easily be grabbed at the corner store or online But Tiffany faces the same challenge confronting any of the traditional companies trying to better appeal to customers with changing tastes and a fickle appetite when it comes to how and when they want to shop Executives are coming at the problem in various ways including acting more like Amazon Walmart Inc for instance has bought up a bunch of online retailers and Indias biggest online marketplace Home Depot Inc and Target have bought companies recently that enhance their shipping or digital retailing capabilities Still these companies remain as tied to physical stores as Tiffany is PricewaterhouseCoopers annual Consumer Insights survey indicates store investments are justified The firm started researching online buying habits in 2010 at a time when it seemed people were buying from physical stores less often In 2014 only 36 of respondents said they shopped at a bricksandmortar store at least once a week That is changing By 2015 40 of respondents reported visiting a physical store at least weekly In this years survey the number was up to 44 Retailers are smart to better integrate the physical shopping experience with peoples online habits but now is not the time to give up on making stores better For proof look no further than a new cafe that Tiffany opened at the flagship which is painted in the familiar blue hue that dresses jewelry boxes It accommodates about 40 people at a time On Wednesday more than 1000 people sat on a internal waiting list hoping that a reservation would open up Mr Bogliolo is committing between 1 and 2 of revenues to the Fifth Avenue remake over three years The redesign had been proposed before he joined the company but he put the decision on ice until he found his footing It was the decision that was most worrisome because a product or campaign you can correct but if you do something like this wrong its wrong he said He finally took the issue to the board this summer and has now deployed designers to update the store so it can better adapt to how shoppers will behave five or 10 years from now Among the benchmarks for the redesign are airports and theaters both of which must excel at moving large groups of people through limited spaces As part of the renovation Mr Bogliolo would like to address the amount of time a visitor waits to look at an engagement ring in the store Queues are not part of the dream he said Write to John D Stoll at johnstollwsjcom

Apple Inc AAPL 006 to become the second US company to reach 1 trillion in market value reflecting the online retailers striking transformation from a profitless bookseller into a disruptive force of commerce Shares of Amazon climbed 19 in midday trading Tuesday topping the 205027 needed to push the companys value above 1 trillion The stock has surged 75 in 2018 and added more than 435 billion to the companys market capitalizationroughly the size of Walmart Inc Costco Wholesale Corp COST 041 and Target Corp TGT 087 combined Investors have rewarded the Seattlebased company as it demonstrated better financial discipline in recent quarters reporting record profits because of lucrative businesses such as cloud computing despite aggressively spending on industries from health care to grocery delivery Theyve proven they can make it work said Michael Lippert who manages the Baron Capital BCAP 9800 Opportunity Fund that counts Amazon as its largest holding Theyre spending a lot on all these things to build and enforce their competitive advantages Amazon and Apple which hit the trilliondollar milestone on Aug 2 symbolize the growing influence of tech companies on markets and the economy The industry is amassing wealth and power creating a new order in business where the most valuable resource is no longer oil but data Not far behind in market value are Google owner Alphabet Inc and Microsoft Corp both approaching 900 billion while Facebook Inc which crossed 500 billion in July 2017 a day after Amazonhas stalled at those levels amid a dataprivacy scandal and growth concerns The companies increasing clout have prompted lawmakers to scrutinize the tech sector more closely Amazon which captures nearly half of all US dollars spent online is simultaneously drawing the ire of President Trump over its effect on traditional retail and its use of the US Postal Service Sen Bernie Sanders has also criticized the company for the way it pays and treats its warehouse workers something Amazon has said is an inaccurate portrayal Investors also worry about the tech companies outsize impact on the stock market Amazon Apple and Microsoft have accounted for more than 35 of the SampP 500s total return this year according to SampP Dow Jones Indices data through Aug 28 One of the biggest beneficiaries of Amazons growth is its 54yearold leader Jeff Bezos who has surpassed Bill Gates to become the richest man in the world according to multiple indices that track the worlds wealthiest people Mr Bezos owned roughly 16 of Amazon as of an August regulatory filing and is worth about 166 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index Amazon has expanded rapidly since its humble founding as an online bookstore in Mr Bezoss garage in 1994 The internet then was just becoming a viable platform and the most valuable companies at the time included industrial conglomerate General Electric Co oil giant Exxon Inc and telecommunications power ATampT Inc Amazon was valued at less than 500 million when it went public in 1997 A 1000 investment in the IPO would be worth roughly 14 million today adjusted for stock splits Tom Alberg founding managing director for Madrona Venture Group invested in Mr Bezoss initial 1 million round of funding in 1995 and has served on the board since the beginning At the time I dont think that any of us saw that the internet or Amazon would become as significant as theyve become Mr Alberg said He preferred to buy his books in stores and many believed consumers would balk at paying with a credit card online Mr Bezos and Amazon have been successful by staying intensely focused on customers working to retain top talent innovating and taking big risks on projectseven if they fail Mr Alberg said People have asked me Whats Amazons secret to success he said There are no secrets Mr Bezos has built his business by keeping prices low and expanding quickly Opening the companys site to millions of small businesses retailers and manufacturers accelerated growth helping capturing sales from other retail chains Last year the companys online store sales topped 108 billion and the services it sold other merchants added to that total Amazon along the way has created popular electronic devices produced awardwinning films and shows and built a cash cow by renting computer power on its servers to other companies Amazon Web Services made more than 17 billion in revenue last year and has become the companys biggest profit driver In recent months Amazon has acquired grocery chain Whole Foods Market giving it roughly 470 brickandmortar locationsand online pharmacy PillPack It has enabled logistics drivers to deliver inside consumers homes and cars and is working on a delivery service expected to one day compete with FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc As the company expanded Amazons influence on markets also grew It has inspired exchangetraded funds that bet against brickandmortar retailers and even socalled value investors that tend to avoid large tech and internet firms say they study the company to understand other sectors The tentacles of Amazon are so long and reach so many industries that you have to have an understanding of that business and where theyre going said Matt Lockridge portfolio manager of the Westwood Large Cap Value Fund It took Amazon just 165 trading days to grow its market value from 600 billion in January to 1 trillion pushing it past the more established Microsoft and Alphabet By comparison Apple needed 183 sessions to hit 1 trillion after piercing 900 billion in November Amazon is more expensive than many of its peers It trades at about 90 times projected earnings for the next 12 months compared with valuations of roughly 25 for Alphabet and Microsoft and 17 for Apple and the broader SampP 500 Part of the discrepancy is because Amazons record secondquarter earnings of 253 billion are still billions below the profits generated by Apple Alphabet and Microsoft The higher market multiple is a reminder of how much investors have embraced Mr Bezos strategy of heavy spending in the past 20 years Some analysts expect Amazon to soon overtake Apple as the largest US company which would mark the first such change since 2016 when Alphabet briefly passed the iPhone maker Mr Bezos initial shareholder letter in 1997which he resends every yeartouted the companys indifference to shortterm Wall Street reactions At allhands meetings with employees Mr Bezos has quoted legendary investor Benjamin Graham In the short run the market is

brand also nods to the companys new tagline Wellness that works WW CEO Mindy Grossman tells Fortune that the branding and strategy change was necessary to keep the company primed to win more of the booming health and wellness market and positioned to hit its target announced in February of hitting 2 billion in revenue by 2020 up from 13 billion last year We will never abdicate our authority and

people who can share tips and provide support so you dont cheat Community is essential Grossman says People want purpose Indeed technology has played a big part in WWs efforts to reinvent itself The company is betatesting the integration of its services with Amazon s Alexa personal assistant and Google s Assistant to let a member say verbally ask how many points a given food count for or track what they eat Its also adjusting its signature point system which assigns points to individual items so a person can use WWs mobile app to budget their caloric intake based on his or her height weight age sex and activity If were really going to be about holistic wellness we have to provide people with the tools for all parts of wellness Grossman says That means what they put in their body how they move their body how they think whats going to make them feel accountable to themselves Getting to 2 billion in sales by 2020 which means 15 growth per year might seem a tad ambitious In reality its where WW should have been by now Revenue peaked at 184 billion six years ago and fell all the way to 116 billion in 2014 before starting to rebound It was a stunning decline given the companys reputation for effectiveness not to mention the ongoing obesity epidemic But more Americans were eschewing subscriptions to services that assigned points to different foods in a bid for them to gauge overall leanness and healthfulness Instead consumers were opting to download any of a multitude of free fitness apps many of which linked their diet to their exercise regimen Suddenly WW found itself

thats clear its that a focus on dieting seems increasingly out of step with society If you look at how weve moved from this age of dieting to this age of wellness the weight in the name is holding us back says Tifford Or as Grossman likes to put it Healthy is the new skinny If WW succeeds in its new positioning the upside could be huge For example the company thinks its new WellnessWins rewards

10 of WWs membership despite efforts over the years to increase that figure Whats more WW hopes that it can improve its customer retention rate of nine monthsan alltime high for the companyas its rewards program makes its app and therefore WW programs stickier But there are hurdles A Morgan Stanley analyst recently published a note warning that investors were overestimating how much market share WW could grab given its stiff competition WW shares trade at about 70 now well above the roughly 6 that Winfrey bought in for but well below the 10573 price reached not long ago Others believe WW is making all the right moves A JP Morgan analyst wrote last month that there is a clear pathway for WW to hit its 2 billion sales target and lifted the target price on the stock to 120 The analyst also wrote that WWs digital push would boost profitability noting that online membership profit margins are 40 higher than those from members who go to any of the approximately 31000 meetings that WW holds each week The more digital users WW has the more attractive it will be to potential partners which could include businesses like fitness centers WW on Monday also announced a partnership with Headspace to have the meditation companys services embedded in the WW app Sixteen months into her tenure its clear Grossman aims to reinvent WW with the same sense of urgency with which she modernized HSN where she was CEO for nine years and turned the television shopping network into an ecommerce powerhouse that generates half its sales online Weight Watchers is an incredible legacy brand and we want to recognize that she says But we have to move forward and we have to recognize what the world is today

the target price on the stock to 120 The analyst also wrote that WWs digital push would boost profitability noting that online membership profit margins are 40 higher than those from members who go to any of the approximately 31000 meetings that WW holds each week The more digital users WW has the more attractive it will be to potential partners which could include businesses like fitness centers

204,205,Online Orders Force Supermarkets to Rethink Their Stores,"New layouts, curbside pickup zones, round-the-clock restocking help retailers handle new shopping patterns.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/online-orders-force-supermarkets-to-rethink-their-stores-1538532420,2018-10-03 02:07:06,Smart amp Final Inc has made some changes lately that would seem like nearheresy for a supermarket The Californiabased chain ripped out racks of snacks and other profitable impulse purchases near the doors of some stores and instead installed freezers there But grocery executives say the seemingly irrational move is simply one of many signs that the supermarket business is radically changing The freezers will serve as pickup points for customers who order their groceries online and may never go any farther into the store Such online sales says Smart and Final Chief Executive David Hirz is becoming a meaningful piece of our business After years of inertia US supermarket chains are racing to add online options such as home delivery and instore and curbside pickup to keep shoppers from shifting more of the 800 billion in annual food and beverage spending to ecommerce firms such as Amazoncom Inc The process is spurring retailers and major food brands to change fundamental aspects of their operationsfrom staffing and supply networks to the way they organize their parking lots and stores At the same time the online shift has created complications for the physical stores Bill Bishop cofounder of consulting firm Brick Meets Click calls it the biggest change to supermarket operations since the introduction of bar codes to consumers goods There really hasnt been anything this sweeping operationally since Mr Bishop says Expected growth Ecommerce represents less than 5 of US grocery sales currently but food and beverage sales are growing far faster online than in traditional supermarkets Forrester Analytics predicts that by 2022 the US online grocery market will total 365 billion up from an estimated 267 billion this year Walmart Incs purchase of ecommerce site Jetcom in 2016 and Amazons acquisition of Whole Foods last year have pushed grocers to accelerate their online expansions Ecommerce was by far the fastestgrowing groceryshopping channel in 2017 Change in sales from 2016 Ecommerce 260 Limited assortment store 67 Dollar store 66 Fresh format 62 Supercenter 35 32 Super warehouse 30 Small grocery 28 Wholesale club 17 Convenience store 13 Traditional supermarket 15 Massmarket retailer 19 Drug 60 Military Looking not to be left behind grocers are remodeling their stores and designing new locations to better accommodate online ordering Smart amp Final plans to make the front of some of its new stores wider to allow for more racks and refrigerators Mr Hirz says Many supermarkets are reserving parking spaces where customers and delivery services can quickly pick up online orders bagged at stores Some stores have designated checkout lines to ring up larger orders from thirdparty online grocerydelivery services such as Instacart while others have created separate entrances for delivery pickups Food makers meanwhile are beefing up ecommerce units to make sure customers can find their goods online and to track their flow from retailers to customers homes We have to all be careful to think this through says John Carroll general manager of ecommerce for CocaCola Co which has 50 employees working in its online division The beverage and snack company now replenishes stocks at some stores around the clock Mr Carroll says after finding that nearly 50 of online orders are placed at night and retailers tend to package pickup orders during off hours It also has changed some of its packaging to make it lighter and less prone to damage for its online sales Food retailers such as Walmart WMT 079 and Kroger Co KR 115 are spending tens of millions of dollars to acquire digitalordering technologies implement homedelivery systems and build thousands of store pickup points for online orders Kroger the USs largest supermarket chain has hired or assigned nearly 19000 workers to run an estimated 1400 pickup sites for online orders covering roughly half of the companys stores It is expanding sameday delivery through Instacart to 75 additional markets this fall and launched its own mailorder service for shelfstable goods this summer Target Corp TGT 209 is introducing a new inventory system to replenish its stores and fill online orders faster as part of a 7 billion overhaul Retailers also are adding online more of the bulk items that ecommerce shoppers prefer Larger packages of cookies and other foods tend to be more economic to ship online helping to offset delivery costs says Carmela Cugini vice president of operations and curation at Jetcom Snack brands meanwhile are trying to figure out how to boost impulse purchases when customers increasingly arent walking by their items at checkout Hershey Co HSY 104 pays for promotions and better retailersearch results to encourage online shoppers to add its candies and snacks to their online baskets and uses its data to tailor those promotions based on past purchases says Doug Straton the companys chief digital commerce officer You cannot think about impulse purchases the same way as in the physical world says Mr Straton Many customers have come to love services they say save them time and hassle I dont physically shop in grocery stores anymore unless it is out of absolute necessity says Shelby Allen a 23yearold healthcare worker from Hunt County Texas who uses Walmarts grocery pickup service for most of her supermarket shopping It has simplified my life so much The online push however poses risks for grocers as it requires upfront investment and can detract from the instore experience for customers who still generate most of grocers sales Because most US grocers fulfill online orders from physical stores rather than warehouses like Amazon keeping goods in stock can be tricky given different ordering patterns and limited backroom space Grocers tend to fulfill online orders from their back inventories but thirdparty delivery services such as Instacart send couriers into stores to grab products off store shelves Clerks fulfilling online orders can clog aisles and checkout lanes or pick over the best produce customers and grocery consultants say The last thing I need while getting groceries is more frustration says Kristyn Booth a 48yearold teacher from Austin Texas who resents the lines that online grocery pickers create at the stores where she shops Trained pickers Instacart says it is trying to lighten its impact on stores by running tight staging areas in supermarket backrooms batching orders and using dedicated checkout lanes The company which contracts with 50000 shoppers says it does train pickers to select the best produce though that varies by personal preferences Kroger is trying to combat congestion in its aisles by having clerks picking produce for online orders wear portable scales to speed up the process says Matt Thompson vice president of digital Grocers and food makers also are scrutinizing their supply systems to keep from running out of stock as ecommerce orders swell The Grocery Manufacturers Association was stunned to discover in August that online grocery outofstock rates hover at 15 nearly double instore averages When customers dont immediately find the items they want 70 switch to another brand or store or stop their order the trade association found Kroger has fined suppliers who dont deliver on time and in full and Walmart has given more business to those consistently delivering on time Smart amp Final is getting more frequent delivery of goods executives say Walmart also is working on integrating its supply chain with its Jetcom division It aims to get more goods to customers more quickly by using algorithms to determine which fulfillment centers can best fulfill a customers order says Ms Cugini In the future grocers may need to build separate warehouses for fulfilling online orders given the pressure the business creates on their existing supermarkets says Nick Hernandez managing director of retail services at realestate services firm Transwestern Retail locations can shrink while the warehouses could be rented for a fraction of the cost of a storefront supermarket he says Through it all grocers are struggling to find a balance between encouraging customers to place orders online and drawing customers into their stores The stores have to improve says Mr Bishop who advises supermarkets on how to build online operations We havent found the secret sauce to get shoppers to routinely go to the store Ms

221,222,Here's how Target plans to beat Amazon and Walmart in the shipping wars this holiday season,"Target just had one of its strongest quarters in its history, but competition is only heating up with rivals like Walmart and Amazon.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/04/target-hopes-to-pass-amazon-walmart-in-shipping-wars-during-holidays.html,2018-10-04 14:00:00,Target has been busy upgrading its supply chain and this holiday season marks its biggest test yet div gt divgroup gt pfirstchildgt Early last year the retailer said it would pour 7 billion into investments to turn around its business over the next three years A portion went into bulking up its delivery options making it more convenient for people to shop in Target stores and online While Target declined to say exactly how much it spent on those efforts its easy to see the results It has rolled out free twoday shipping for some customers acquired a transportation company and is adding services like curbside pickup and sameday delivery in major metro areas Theres a huge opportunity for Target as it competes with rivals like Walmart and Amazon this holiday season These new convenient options may make the difference in where a shopper goes to stock up on holiday treats and gifts US shoppers are poised to give retailers another strong holiday but it may not be as robust as last year according to some forecasts From my perspective I think Target has a more differentiated product assortment than Walmart today Stacey Widlitz president of consulting group SW Retail Advisors told CNBC They have the product to win and now they are putting the tools in customers hands like twoday shipping Customers are now like Wait a minute Target behaves like Amazon and they have strong privatelabel categories Why would I not add some extra stuff in my basket she said Last holiday season Target said its stores fulfilled 70 percent of all digital orders This year that percentage will be even higher Thats a big reason why the company is hiring 120000 temporary workers or 20 percent more people than it did a year ago About 7500 of those workers are expected to help pack boxes in warehouses Target said Overall Target said it will double the number of people fulfilling online orders in stores and distribution centers this year Our stores are at the center of our digital growth CEO Brian Cornell told CNBC last month They are fulfilling the majority of our online orders They are center to everything we are doing at Target The company just had one of its strongest quarters ever This holiday season Target will have to prove it can keep the momentum going One way to do that is to prove that its network of distribution centers and delivery services can handle what could turn out to be an unprecedented surge in traffic in stores and digital orders Last August I ordered a bunch of stuff from Target and it took so long to get it Widlitz said This year I ordered stuff and I got it next day and some of it was even flown in That is a game changer One improvement was free twoday shipping for Target credit card holders which launched earlier this year For everyone else twoday shipping is free with a minimum order of 35 That compares with Amazon which offers free twoday shipping for Prime members who pay 119 annually and Walmart which offers free twoday shipping on orders totaling more than 35 but doesnt have the credit card perk For Target the perks for freeday shipping serve as another way to lure more shoppers to sign up for its REDcard which also takes 5 percent off purchases Target said 90 percent of its orders for twoday delivery are now fulfilled from the back of its stores The company said it uses about 1400 of its roughly 1800 stores in the US today to do this For those customers who are still choosing to visit Target stores the retailer has been rolling out options like order online pick up in store along with curbside pickup From the time orders associated with these services are placed Target said it has the majority of items ready within an hour for customers The driveup service in particular has grown from a trial at one store to more than 800 locations across the US today And Target said roughly onethird of customers who come inside a store to pick up an online order end up making other purchases while they are there Once you are in one of our stores you might come in for a toy and walk out with something for your home Cornell told CNBC We are making sure that whole offering is readily available To become a bigger force with sameday delivery Target acquired Instacart rival Shipt for 550 million late last year The deal brought with it a network of Shipts personal shoppers that pick items off of shelves and deliver them to customers homes The service which is also available at other retailers including Costco and Publix retails for 99 per year Target said Shipts membership has tripled since it was acquired Shipt currently delivers a wide variety of items that Target sells the company chose to start with groceries home decor and electronics primarily All major product categories including apparel are expected to be available on the service by the end of 2019 By comparison Walmart has been using its Jetcom business to make a sameday delivery push in New York And Amazons Fresh which serves select ZIP codes in many major US cities offers sameday delivery of groceries so long as shoppers place their orders that morning Before Shipt Target last August acquired transportation service Grand Junction which now helps the company deliver items purchased within the store to shoppers homes within two hours This is being tested in New York San Francisco Washington DC Chicago and Boston The company said the average basket size of these customers is 200 the most of any fulfillment service Thats primarily because shoppers use it for bulkier and likely more expensive items like coffee tables and flatscreen TVs Target also has an offering similar to Amazon Now called Restock Customers can pack a box full of household items like dish soap and cereal until the box reaches 45 pounds Again this is free for Target credit card members with other customers paying a 299 fee for shipping Its also possible these services could expand or be supplemented with other offers during the holiday period This has happened in the recent years Zooming out as we think about Targets supply chain and inventory management in the context of Walmart we believe Target does need to catch up to its competitor but also acknowledge progress is being made behind the scenes Cowen amp Cos Oliver Chen said in a research note We do believe Target has demonstrated the retailer can very quickly scale initiatives and acquire differentiated assets to drive growth he said

delivery in a direct challenge to Amazoncom Inc Retailers from Walmart Inc WMT 186 to Nordstrom Inc JWN 1366 say the burgeoning number of choices are designed to allow shoppers to get their purchases in whatever way is most convenient for them But the new services particularly those that encourage shoppers to retrieve online orders in stores also are aimed at defraying shipping costs reducing returns and boosting sales Fulfillment years ago was done in bulk and just from a store point of view said Blake Nordstrom copresident of the eponymous chain And now its about niches Its about anywhere the customer wants to be able to buy it or return it Research from consulting firm AlixPartners says the most profitable transaction for retailers is when shoppers make purchases the oldfashioned way by visiting a store That is no longer the preferred option for many people This holiday US online sales are expected to increase 15 from last year to 1241 billion according to Adobe Analytics which analyzes visits to retail websites Overall holiday sales are expected to rise as much as 48 to 721 billion according to the National Retail Federation a trade group Retailers reap some benefits from the new methods Macys Inc M 319 says shoppers who pick up online orders in stores spend an additional 25 while they are there Shipping online orders from stores rather than from a distribution center saves money Target Corp TGT 134 says because the stores are closer to peoples homes And Walmart says the fulfillment options have helped it compete with online rivals which have fewer such choices One catch for shoppers The method they choose often determines whether they have access to a retailers full selection or a more limited offering At Macys for instance shoppers who elect to buy online and pick up in store are choosing just from the merchandise available in that particular location But if they buy online and have the goods shipped to a store all the offerings in the Macys system are available to them The myriad choices each have their own shorthandthere is Skip the Line Drive Up and Get It Fast to name a fewwhich can be confusing Many consumers say they arent aware of all the options Its so overwhelming and they dont do a good job of explaining them said Melissa Bergsteinsson a 28yearold teacher in San Ramon Calif Even though she searches for deals and products on the web before visiting stores pickup options for online orders dont appeal to her If youre driving all the way to the store she said you might as well go in and look around That hasnt stopped retailers from rolling out more choices Target is making no fewer than six fulfillment options available this holiday season including free curbside pickup which it calls Drive Up and free instore pickup branded as Order Pickup Target shoppers in some urban markets also can have instore purchases delivered home the same day for a 7 fee a service the company calls Delivery From Store Or

for certain of its privatelabel products that because of tariffs it can no longer sell profitably if priced below competitors according to a person familiar with the matter The person declined to comment on specific product lines but added that Amazon sources the bulk of its consumer electronics from China Dollar Tree Inc DLTR 183 said in an emailed statement it has negotiated price concessions from vendors canceled orders and changed its product mix Target Corp TGT 070 said in an emailed statement it has many levers it can pull to remain pricecompetitive but didnt elaborate In China manufacturers of handbags lighting footwear and other products say they are feeling the strain Many are trying to find new customers outside the US and some have resorted to offering discounts in a bid to halt a slide in orders Last year the US imported 14 billion worth of handbags and 147 billion in footwear from China while imports of lighting equipment reached 711 million according to the United Nations Comtrade Database Both sides are hoping that trade talks between President Trump and Chinas Xi Jinping at the G20 summit this week in Buenos Aires will reduce trade tensions and stave off another round of import duties US levies of 10 on 200 billion in Chinese goods took effect Sept 24 and are slated to rise to 25 at the beginning of next year Mr Trump also has threatened to expand the list to more than 250 billion worth of additional products covering almost all other goods imported from China In an interview with The Wall Street Journal this week President Trump said he expects to move ahead with the 25 tariff saying it is highly unlikely that he would accept Beijings request to hold off on the increase Walmart the worlds biggest retailer said in an emailed answer to questions submitted before the interview that it hopes the meeting in Buenos Aires will produce a constructive framework to resolve the trade tensions US companies have stressed to investors that they are trying to mitigate the impact of tariffs on their marginsfor example by passing cost increases along to customers when concessions cant be squeezed out of suppliers Retailers in particular say that although tariffs so far havent had a huge impact on their operations that could change if the levies get steeper or are applied to more products While last months trade data from China showed an increase in shipments to the US manufacturers have said that is partly due to buyers frontloading orders to move batches to the US before Januarys expected tariff increase In interviews dozens of Chinese manufacturers reported constricted sales Sunshine Leisure Products a maker of camping chairs in the eastern province of Zhejiang said orders are down about 30 even as it lowered prices by as much as 7 A supplier of LED decoration lights in the eastern province of Shandong said orders for next yeartypically settled by Novemberwere still in abeyance as American customers have been asking it to bear the 10 tariff In the southern city of Shenzhen a sales manager for furniture maker Homegard International said orders have fallen by half Extended haggling over orders is throwing supplychain negotiations into disarray Typically in the final quarter of the year merchants begin discussions about new products models and orders for the following year But many say that hasnt happened Order negotiations have dragged on says Andy Li sales manager for a company in the southern province of Fujian that supplies backpacks and other assorted textile merchandise for companies such as Walmart Usually negotiations take about two weeks but it has been at least a month with no resolution with some customers Mr Li said declining to identify them Taizhou Shilin Shoes based in the eastern province of Zhejiang reported that its two American customers have said because of price pressures they need to turn to suppliers of lowerpriced shoes made with inferior materials At a recent trade fair in Guangzhou exhibitors reported fewer American buyers That is spurring Chinese suppliers to look for other sources of revenue they said such as more aggressively targeting European customers The impact has extended to products not yet on the US tariff listsuch as toysfor fear that they will be hit if trade relations worsen One toy maker said buyers are asking for orders to be ready for shipping in a much shorter time than the customary sixtoeightweek turnaround period If levies do expand to toysand 82 of toys sold in the US are imported from China according to the US Department of

ecigarette startup Juul Labs Inc at a roughly 38 billion valuation according to people familiar with the matter an investment that would make Juul one of the most valuable private companiesThe 128 billion cash injection could be announced as soon as this week the people said It would more than double what Juul was valued at just a few months ago a sign of how quickly the startup has been growing and Altrias desire to find growth outside its shrinking cigarette business The Wall Street Journal earlier reported on the discussionsAt 38 billion threeyearold Juul would be worth more than several wellknown Silicon Valley startups including Airbnb the homesharing service Elon Musks space venture SpaceX and three times as much as Pinterest Juuls valuation would be on par with the market capitalization of public companies such asDelta Air Lines Inc DAL 193Target Corp TGT 380andFord Motor CoThe rich valuation comes at a time that the San Francisco company is under fire from regulators educators and public health officials over its popularity among children and teens Juul says its products are designed to help adult cigarette smokers switch to a lessharmful way to inhale nicotine but the companys own research shows its sleek device has hooked many people who had never smoked or had quit smoking Juul which has about 1500 employees was on track for 2 billion in annual revenue It has outperformed its internal forecasts from its last funding round according to a person familiar with the matter The company has profit margins as high as 75 the person added which is much higher than traditional tobaccoThe investment would give the Marlboro maker greater access to a rapidly growing but increasingly controversial segment of the nicotine market It would also expand Altrias reach beyond the US CurrentlyPhilip Morris International Incsells Marlboro and other Altria brands outside the US Juul products are sold in Canada the UK Israel and Russia and the company has expansion plans in Europe and AsiaSome Juul employees have been upset by their companys talks with Altria saying it is a betrayal of the startups mission to help cigarette smokers switch to lessharmful products In an allhands meeting after the Journal first reported the discussions Juul Chief Executive Kevin Burns told staff that any deal would have to meet criteria including Juul maintaining full control of the company employees having the option to cash out shares and the new investor taking actions to support Juuls mission according to a person familiar with the matterA deal with Altria would give Juul access to better shelf space at retailers and marketing access to millions of cigarette smokers Youth use of ecigarettes has soared over the past year thanks largely to Juuls thumbdrive shaped vaporizers whose sales have skyrocketed since mid2017 One out of every five highschool studentsmore than three million teensreported using ecigarettes recently according to a federal survey conducted this past spring Altrias stock had declined nearly 30 over the past year as the company grappled with declines in traditional smokers and a potential US ban on menthol cigarettesThe Richmond Vabased company is now pivoting to areas of growth in the market Earlier this month Altria made a 18 billion investment in Canadian cannabis company Cronos That deal will give Altria access to a growing part of the industry as marijuana becomes legalized in more markets Altrias pursuit of Juul signals a lack of confidence in a heatnotburn device called IQOS that it hopes to market in the US in a partnership with Philip Morris International The product which heats tobacco but doesnt burn it has gained traction in Japan and other countries but its prospects in the US are unclear In January an advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration said scientific evidence was insufficient to support an ambitious marketing claim proposed by Philip Morris that switching to IQOS from cigarettes reduces the risks of tobaccorelated disease Juul like many other ecigarette devices is sold without formal FDA approval and has been able to advertise on social media unlike traditional cigarette brands The FDA has given ecigarettes already on the market several years before they must apply for approval To combat underage use the FDA recently imposed restrictions on the sale of certain flavors of ecigarettes that it says appeal to teens Juul refills with nontobacco flavors such as mango and cucumber account for a sizable chunk of its sales according to analystsJuul has taken steps to restrict sales to minors including pulling all but its mint menthol and tobaccoflavored products from bricksandmortar stores It continues to sell all its flavors on its website which it says has age verification technology The company has discontinued its use of US social mediaAltria recently discontinued its own ecigarette products sold under the MarkTen and Green Smoke

this week as they hunt for hot gifts during the years busiest days for toy sales and retailers scramble to keep shelves stockedAbout 10 of annual US toy sales or nearly 3 billion occur in the week before Christmas according to the research firm NPD Group Inc and this year the industry is expected to be strained by the absence of around 800 Toys R Us stores which liquidated over the summerThe bigbox toy retailer was most valuable in the final days of the season when it kept its stores stocked with toys including many of the topselling items analysts and toy companies said It also offered a far broader selection of Barbie dolls Lego sets and Nerf blasters thanTarget Corp TGT 092Walmart Inc WMT 017and other retailers carried in their designated toy spaceRetailers have picked up some of the slack this year with added floor space to sell toys and deeper inventories Some have opened popup stores for the holiday season to capture some of the displaced sales from Toys R Us which logged more than 14 billion in sales last December Retailers and toy makers have worked all year to settle on the right mix and quantity of toys they plan to sell That prep work now comes down to having shelves stocked and more inventory readyAlready Walmart and Target have had large pockets of indemand toys missing from their stores an ominous sign for the final days said Jim Silver editor at TTPMcom a toy review website Its about replenishment restocking quickly getting product onto shelves said Mr SilverA spokesman for Target said the chain has deepened its selection and is wellprepared for the late rush for toys We have never been in a better position with our toy inventory in the days before Christmas including our supply of the hottest toys he said EvenAmazoncom Inc AMZN 571is scrambling to keep up with demand for certain toys The ecommerce giant mailed out a toy catalog to homes this holiday season for the first time and some items it featured are now only available on its site from thirdparty merchants at elevated pricesToy shoppers are coming to stores later in the holiday season and this years calendar with Christmas falling on Tuesday portends for a bigger lastminute shopping window than normal Last year when Christmas fell on a Monday sales rose 65 in the final week from the previous year Its really given consumers permission to wait until the last minute NPD toy analyst Juli Lennett said Carol Saparnis said she misses having Toys R Us around for a broader selection of gifts including educational toys that other retailers didnt carry Last year I could go to Toys R Us and pretty much get something unique for everyone the 63year old New England resident said This year she has found retailers only carry a few Paw Patrol play sets and she had to return the one she bought because someone had already gotten it for her intended recipient I picked the wrong one Anne Marie Kehoe Walmarts vice president of toys said the retailer continues to receive shipments of some of the topselling toys including Ryans World Giant Mystery Egg LOL Bigger Surprise Hot Wheels sets and Nerf blasters She said its inventory levels are strong and that customers can shop with confidence that they will have the toys they are looking for all the way through ChristmasTargets toy inventory is up by a doubledigit percentage from last year and the retailer said its assortment and array of purchasing options including buying online and picking up in stores will help it handle the final holiday surge The company spokesman said Targets inventory levels will be useful during the week after Christmas for giftcard redemptions Amazon also has options for shoppers who wait A spokeswoman said free sameday delivery on some products allows orders to be placed on Christmas Eve and the retailer has kiosks in Chicago Los Angeles and San Francisco that feature toys Smaller retailers aim to fill in if larger ones run out of hot products Barnes amp Noble Incs chief merchant Tim Mantel said the bookstore chain placed large orders of more popular products We focus our assortment and buy deep in the best toys while not overinvesting in a breadth of products that other retailers are forced to carry Mr Mantel saidToy makers are trying to adjust as well  Jeremy Padawer copresident of Wicked Cool Toys which makes Pokmon toys and Cabbage Patch Kids dolls said retailers have been willing to take orders later in the year to capture more sales and the company had kept more inventory in the US to react quickly You have a bit more responsibility to carry more domestic stock under these circumstances Mr Padawer said Otherwise you say Its all on them and thats not a fair way to operate when theres such disruption in the marketWrite to Paul Ziobro
