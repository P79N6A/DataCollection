9,India puts the squeeze on Walmart and Amazon,Stringent new ecommerce rules send unfortunate signal to international investors,https://www.ft.com/content/d1a2510a-261a-11e9-8ce6-5db4543da632,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-04T10:39:45Z,"Walmart’s $16bn purchase last year of India’s ecommerce platform Flipkart seemed to show the country rolling out the red carpet for foreign investors. Now the US retailer and its compatriot Amazon — which has spent $5bn on its Indian operations since 2012 — have found the carpet pulled from under their feet. New rules that New Delhi brought into force last Friday, unveiled five weeks earlier, will upend their business models and squeeze the returns on their investments.
Though the Walmart deal — which made it India’s biggest foreign investor — provided nearly $2bn in tax revenues to New Delhi, in reality India has long been ambivalent about foreign direct investment in retail. Ostensibly, it is concerned about the impact on millions of small, family-run stores that dominate Indian retailing. 
Prime minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata party is sensitive, too, to the powerful traders who control the wholesale and distribution business. They fear being squeezed by any modernisation of India’s fragmented and inefficient supply chain. They also happen to be traditional BJP supporters.
New Delhi’s convoluted policies allow full foreign ownership of “single-brand” retailers, such as Gap or Ikea, but restrict it in “multi-brand” retail — keeping out foreign supermarket chains. India also allows foreign ownership of multi-brand wholesalers selling to businesses, but not to individuals.
Many ecommerce start-ups, often backed by foreign venture capital, paid little heed to these distinctions. In 2016, New Delhi clarified the rules. It allowed foreign-backed companies to run online marketplaces — connecting independent sellers with customers — but not to hold inventory or sell goods directly to consumers themselves.
Foreign-backed retailers found workarounds that seemed to comply with the letter of the rules, though traders complained they violated the spirit. Flipkart set up a wholesale distributor, Flipkart India, which supplies affiliated sellers. Amazon took 49 per cent of a joint venture that owns Cloudtail India — now the largest seller on Amazon’s Indian marketplace.
But with elections looming, Mr Modi has dramatically altered, or in the government’s words, clarified the rules. No seller on a foreign-funded online marketplace can source more than 25 per cent of its inventory from a wholesaler linked to the marketplace, or have any of its equity owned by the marketplace or associated companies. 
Amazon and Flipkart must hurriedly restructure their operations. Traders are jubilant, but the biggest winner may be Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Retail, which is planning its own ecommerce portal and is not affected by the regulations.
Critics say Flipkart and Amazon have aggressively exploited ambiguities in the vaguely worded previous rules, that enabled them to build up wholesale operations — engaged in what local competitors charge was predatory pricing — earning far greater revenues than the marketplaces that are supposedly their main businesses. 
Yet New Delhi never challenged such arrangements; officials assured Walmart they had no issues with Flipkart’s operations. India’s competition authority approved the takeover in August. 
Making sudden changes, and rules restricting foreign but not domestic players, sends unfortunate signals to international investors. Pricing practices are best controlled by effective competition regulation, not ownership restrictions. The new ecommerce rules may help protect India’s small retailers. But they will reinforce the country’s reputation, not for red-carpet treatment of investors, but as a risky and unpredictable place to do business."

The company clinched a $218m deal to take over Maxwell Technologies, a California-based developer of electric batteries that has counted Volvo-owner Geely, Lamborghini and General Motors among its customers. 
Maxwell is a maker of ultracapacitors, which can be integrated into regenerative braking systems and used to help lengthen the life of a vehicle’s existing battery for start-stop engine technology. The company also makes power storage systems for electric utilities.
The takeover comes at a testing time for Tesla, as the company accelerates the production of its lower cost Model 3 and tries to move past a scandal last year that saw the Securities and Exchange Commission force Mr Musk to give up his role as chairman of the automaker. Tesla shares have been volatile to start the year, as investors balance an improving balance sheet with news the company’s chief financial officer Deepak Ahuja would step down. 
The deal comes less than a year since US securities regulators charged Maxwell and one of its former sales executives with fraudulently inflating the company’s revenues. Maxwell and the executive settled the charges by paying $2.8m and $500,000 in fines respectively, without admitting or denying guilt. 
The fine was the second time the company had settled charges with US regulators, having been charged in 2011 with repeatedly paying bribes to government officials in China. It also settled those charges with a fine and did not admit or deny the charges.
The sale of Maxwell was approved unanimously by the company’s board of directors, who expect the deal to be completed in the second quarter of 2019. Maxwell Technologies stockholders will receive fractional shares in Tesla worth $4.75 for each share of Maxwell they currently hold, a 55 per cent premium to Friday’s closing price.
“We believe this transaction is in the best interests of Maxwell stockholders and offers investors the opportunity to participate in Tesla’s mission of accelerating the advent of sustainable transport and energy,” said Franz Fink, the chief executive of Maxwell.
The sale of Maxwell was approved unanimously by the company’s board of directors, who expect the deal to be completed in the second quarter of 2019.
Tesla shares slid 2 per cent in early morning trading on Monday to $306.78, while Maxwell stock climbed nearly 50 per cent to $4.59."
14,India’s ecommerce law forces Amazon and Flipkart to pull products,Several lines are now unavailable to comply with new regulations,https://www.ft.com/content/29a96ff6-2615-11e9-8ce6-5db4543da632,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-01T13:04:28Z,"Amazon pulled products from its Indian website, while Walmart said it was “disappointed”, as New Delhi’s new ecommerce rules took effect on Friday, disrupting operations and putting pressure on the retail giants. 
Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart, the two biggest players in India’s fast-growing ecommerce sector, are being forced to overhaul their business models to comply with new rules introduced in late December, after complaints from traders that the US companies were violating India’s ban on foreign direct investment in “multi-brand retailing”.
Amazon and Flipkart had both urged New Delhi to extend the deadline for complying with the new rules for three to six months to give them more time to prepare. But on Thursday night the government said it had decided to enforce its original February 1 deadline. 
In a statement on Friday, Walmart, which spent $16bn to buy Flipkart last year, expressed its dismay. “We are disappointed that the government has decided to implement the regulation changes at such haste,” said Rajneesh Kumar, the company’s chief of corporate affairs in India, citing the “significant work” needed to overhaul its supply chains and systems.
On Friday afternoon, numerous items on Amazon were listed as “currently unavailable”, including the company’s private-label brands such as Amazon Basics, home and kitchen entity Solimo and household line Presto. Clothing items from Indian fashion label Shoppers Stop — a business in which Amazon holds a small stake — were also listed as unavailable. 
“We are beginning to see customers reaching out to us because there are quite a few products that are not available on the website,” said Minari Shah, Amazon spokesperson. 
The Indian government unveiled the new rules on December 26, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi intensifies his efforts to court small businesses ahead of an upcoming general election. 
India has long restricted foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail, ostensibly to protect small shops. But in 2016 New Delhi decided foreign-owned ecommerce platforms could operate as marketplaces — facilitating transactions between sellers and consumers — but could not sell directly to consumers. 
As they grew, Flipkart and Amazon established wholesale distributors to better reach their customers. But the new rules target this workaround, banning foreign ecommerce sites from selling goods from companies in which they own a stake. 
As a result, Amazon and Flipkart face a significant restructuring of their supply chains, according to Anuj Sethi, senior director at the credit rating agency CRISIL. He estimated the changes would affect “nearly 40 per cent” of Amazon and Flipkart’s retail sales — a possible $5.5bn — while bricks-and-mortar retailers would experience a bump in growth.
“I think they will negotiate with the government and try and get some of these rules eased a bit, but it will take some time,” said Mr Sethi. 
Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries has announced that it now planned to launch a new ecommerce platform, which would not be subject to the same restrictions imposed on Amazon or Flipkart. 
Last year, Reliance was part of the government consultations for the new rules, while the foreign ecommerce companies say they were shut out. “We believe that policy should be created in a consultative, market-driven manner,” Walmart’s Mr Kumar said. 
Amazon, which has invested $5bn in India, this week gave a cautious first-quarter sales forecast, citing India’s regulatory turmoil as an impediment to growth. “The situation in India is a bit fluid right now,” chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky told analysts.
Shoppers in India are already hit. Chinmay Dhumal, an 18-year-old engineering student in Mumbai, is annoyed that he cannot find his favourite cut-price items on Amazon any more. 
“They provided really good products at a very good price but now they are taken out of the equation. A good number of items have reduced [in number],” said Mr Dhumal. “I guess I may have to change my habits and walk into a store.”"

Amazon.com Inc. boss Jeff Bezos really wants his company’s movie production division to create a blockbuster hit, he might want to let them focus on his own life.
In the past two days alone, the biography of the world’s richest man has taken more plot twists than a M. Night Shyamalan flick and includes a superstar cast complete with President Donald Trump and a cameo by political sensation Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Threats by a tabloid to publish graphic images sent to a new flame. A private investigator hired to unearth leaks. Conspiracy theories of a connection to the killing of a Saudi dissident journalist. Plea deals with federal prosecutors under pressure. Political intrigue swirling around a proposed $2.5 billion investment on a New York City waterfront. Martin Scorsese is salivating.
The saga began last month when the e-commerce pioneer used Twitter to announce he and Mackenzie, his wife of 25 years, planned to 
divorce. Within hours, the National Enquirer exposed Bezos’s relationship with former TV anchor Lauren Sanchez. That sounds pretty pedestrian now.
The story took on hard-to-believe Hollywood proportions on Thursday. In a lengthy 
blog post, Bezos accused the National Enquirer and its publisher, Trump-ally David Pecker, of blackmail and extortion, publishing email exchanges to back it up. The Enquirer threatened to publish graphic selfies of a scantily clad and sometimes exposed Bezos, saying the images are newsworthy because they reveal poor judgment by the leader of the world’s biggest online retailer.
Bezos representatives argued publication of his private images would violate copyright laws. The Enquirer said it would not publish the photos if Bezos agreed to issue a statement saying the magazine’s reporting isn’t politically motivated. The tabloid also wants to stop Bezos investigating how the photos leaked. The billionaire has hired Gavin de Becker, a private investigator to the stars, to find out what happened.
The blog laid bare the tactics of a tabloid that years ago ended John Edwards’s presidential run by exposing an extramarital affair, and more recently protected then-candidate Trump by buying the stories of women who allegedly were sexually involved with him and then never publishing a word.
The post also highlighted the shrewd public-relations tactics of a billionaire who refuses to be cornered. Forget the portrait painted by the Enquirer of a moneyed philanderer in a mid-life crisis. Bezos cast himself as a hero, protecting the First Amendment at his own risk. His ownership of The Washington Post, which has published stories critical of Trump as well as investigations into the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, is a “complexifier” in his situation, he said. Bezos decided to expose the correspondence with the Enquirer, and risk photos of himself being shared with the world, to stand up against blackmail and extortion and ensure the integrity of the Washington Post, he said.
“It’s unavoidable that certain powerful people who experience Washington Post news coverage will wrongly conclude I am their enemy,” Bezos wrote. “President Trump is one of those people, obvious by his many tweets. Also, The Post’s essential and unrelenting coverage of the murder of its columnist Jamal Khashoggi is undoubtedly unpopular in certain circles.”
The feud between Trump and Bezos is well known, but the suggestion of a potential connection between the Enquirer’s expose and the assassination of Khashoggi was a bizarre twist. Khashoggi was a leading critic of Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whom Trump regards as an important ally. A Saudi Arabian envoy 
said the kingdom wasn’t involved in the fight between Bezos and the National Enquirer, calling it a ""soap opera.""
Bezos’s accusations quickly took on 
far-reaching ramifications. Federal prosecutors are reportedly reviewing the National Enquirer’s dealings with Bezos given the company’s earlier cooperation deal with prosecutors. American Media Inc., owner of the National Enquirer, agreed not to commit crimes to avoid prosecution over hush-money payments to women who claimed relationships with Trump. AMI 
said it acted lawfully in reporting Bezos’s affair, but will investigate claims by the CEO that it was politically motivated.
Bezos’s bombshell allegations were followed Friday by a new revelation. The Washington Post said Amazon was considering withdrawing plans to expand in the Long Island City neighborhood of New York City due to an unrelenting political backlash.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and city mayor Bill de Blasio both celebrated Amazon’s decision to invest $2.5 billion in the city and hire 25,000 people over the next two decades. But several local politicians who were shut out of the negotiations have criticized tax breaks offered to Amazon, questioning the company’s anti-union stance and worrying about low- and middle-income residents getting squeezed out by rent hikes as highly paid tech workers move in.
The news, later confirmed by Bloomberg, shows how Bezos has become a prime target of populist politicians highlighting growing wealth disparity. The idea of tax breaks benefiting the world’s wealthiest man have taken on a life of their own. And the suggestion that Amazon’s response to public scrutiny is to threaten to move its project elsewhere isn’t sitting well.
U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, an outspoken critic of the deal, took to Twitter to 
celebrate the possibility that Amazon would pack it in, saying it proved people could “come together and effectively organize against creeping overreach of one of the world’s biggest corporations.”

23,The supply ship reborn as Edinburgh’s newest luxury hotel,A night on the Fingal is as close as you’ll get to a superyacht without chartering one,https://www.ft.com/content/839de380-2623-11e9-b20d-5376ca5216eb,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-08T05:01:01Z,"There’s nothing new about repurposing old cruise liners and barges as hotels, but they tend to be budget options. Cross the gangway and step aboard Fingal, however, and beyond the fact that you won’t have had to remove your shoes as is the convention on most superyachts, you might feel you’ve alighted on one.
Viewed from the quayside at Edinburgh’s Port of Leith, she bears more than a passing resemblance to the likes of Sir James Dyson’s 91-metre historic motoryacht Nahlin, TalkTalk telecom chairman Sir Charles Dunstone’s Shemara or hedge-fund tycoon Ian Wace’s Alicia. Her livery may be navy and red (most vintage superyachts are a shade of white), but Fingal’s profile (two masts and a central cream-and-black funnel) and proportions (she measures 72 metres from the golden trident on her prow to her stern) more or less accord with theirs. And as is immediately striking from the immaculate marine-grade finish on the caulked reclaimed teak floor, iroko doors, rippled sycamore reception desk and multi-faceted circular glass lift, designed to recall the multiple lenses in the lantern of a lighthouse, no expense has been spared in her refit, a four-year process that cost £5m. Beyond the fact that you won’t actually sail anywhere, a night or two at Edinburgh’s newest hotel is probably the closest you will get to staying on a superyacht without actually chartering one.
Not that Fingal was made for leisure. Launched in 1963, she was (like Nahlin) built on the river Clyde, the last-ever vessel to slip from the dry dock at Glasgow’s once-hallowed Blythswood Shipbuilding Company. She was commissioned by the Northern Lighthouse Board as a steam tender to ferry supplies to lighthouses between the Isle of Man and the west coast of Scotland. But with increasing automation, it became more practical to service them by helicopter, and by the 21st century she was redundant.
She might well then have been turned into a yacht. But in 2014 she was bought by Royal Yacht Enterprises, the trading arm of the Leith-based Royal Yacht Britannia Trust, the heritage charity that maintains as a tourist attraction the yacht used by the British royal family until 1997. Other vessels of historical significance and royal provenance are also under its care, among them the former royal racing yacht, Bloodhound (itself available for charters in the Western Isles), two smaller sailing boats, which the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh had received as wedding presents, and the Royal Nore, a motor launch or “barge” used to entertain heads of state.
Without an obvious royal connection beyond the fact that as patron of the Northern Lighthouse Board, the Princess Royal has spent time aboard, Fingal’s purpose within the fleet is to generate revenue with which to support the trust’s other work. The conversion from working boat to hotel was no little undertaking.
Almost 170 tonnes of steel were removed, not least the cranes; two new decks were added; and its 40 cramped cabins were reconfigured as 23 more spacious ones.
But it does still feel palpably as though you’re on a boat. Stay in one of the four duplexes, the largest cabin options, and you approach via a glass walkway that leads through the magnificent engine room, which has been admirably cleaned up but still smells faintly of engine oil.
Once inside, there’s a little sitting room from which an open-tread brass spiral staircase descends to a bedroom and bathroom in the bowels of the boat, a space defined by the steep contours of the steel hull and a distinctly cambered floor, a curvature that meant every bed had to be individually fitted to ensure the mattresses lie horizontally. Down here you can feel and hear some movement in the water, which froze the night I slept there. So I was glad of the handsome plaid throw on the bed, designed by a young Leith-based weaver, Araminta Campbell, to evoke a stormy Scottish seascape faintly illuminated by a lighthouse. Her waterfront studio is visible from the deck.
I don’t know that I’d give house room to the patterned carpet, but that apart I loved the boat. As you’d expect on an ocean-going vessel built for treacherous seas, almost all the furniture is, if not built-in, then fixed, with no angles or sharp corners. The cabinetry — not least in the leather-faced wardrobe and minibar — was a construction of wonder, with a place for everything and everything in its place, right down to the haggis-flavoured crisps and blonde ale from Oban, gateway to the Hebrides, where the boat was based for much of her active life. (Latterly she worked out of Stromness in Orkney.) There is a certain arch Scottishness to the provisions — shortbread and Tunnock’s Teacakes on the tea tray; “whisky-and-water” scented shower gel from the Dufftown Distillery (as well as a more conventionally fragrant alternative) — but there is no tartan in the decor.
There are abundant nautical references, though. The swivel chair by each desk is based on the boat’s original radio operator’s seat. And brass light fittings and wheel-handled taps call to mind those you would find in a chandlery. Not that there’s anything utilitarian about the bathrooms: there was underfloor heating and a capacious roll-top bath in the one in my quarters, Ornsay, named, as all the cabins are, after a Scottish lighthouse. Above every bed a chart of the contours of the marine area around the relevant beacon (Ornsay is an islet off Skye) has been stitched into a leather panel, just as a compass has been embroidered on to the suede that lines the ceiling above the pillows. There is further lighthouse imagery to be found in the corridors, which are hung with superb photographs by Ian Cowe, who spent more than seven years documenting those managed by the Northern Lighthouse Board.
If such details speak of local artistry and craftsmanship, there are also the usual mod cons: a smart TV, coffee machine and automated Venetian blinds on the portholes. (If you want windows, you need to be on the upper deck or in the main-deck Skerryvore Suite, the fanciest cabin, complete with a secret door disguised as a bookcase to the adjoining room, as well as direct access to the promenade deck.)
Ascend to the top deck, and you’ll come to the original bridge from which the ship was steered, now a private dining-room-cum-library of multiple volumes of the ship’s log, meticulously recorded in commendably neat handwriting. The original ship’s wheel is in there too. Behind it, you’ll find the Lighthouse Bar, a large, light lounge opening on to a spacious deck that is open to non-residents as long as you reserve a table. Here they also serve a hearty cooked breakfast and a lavish £40-a-head afternoon tea, a very big deal in smart Edinburgh hotels, and this one should come to rival those at the Balmoral and the Caledonian. The chorizo-and-olive palmier and assorted titivated-for-Instagram fancy eclairs, macaroons and roulades were exemplary, but it was the lightness of the buttermilk scones and the outstanding smoked-salmon sandwiches I remember it for.
There is also a short unpretentious supper menu (more smoked salmon, Scottish langoustines, local charcuterie, terrines, pasta and tempura). For a proper dinner, however, they suggest you go ashore: Leith has two Michelin-starred restaurants, The Kitchin and Restaurant Martin Wishart, as well as a host of recommended if less exalted places within five or 10 minutes’ walk of the boat. Or if you want to entertain, private dinners can be arranged on the bridge or in the triple-height ballroom that has been converted from what was the hold, while the state of the art galley, large enough to cater for 80, occupies what were the fuel tanks.
In truth the views — over Ocean Drive and across the water towards the unlovely Ocean Terminal shopping mall, beyond which Britannia is berthed — are a little dispiriting. Some visitors will consider the location, two miles north of the Royal Mile and the main attractions, inconvenient. But for anyone who loves boats and lighthouses, Fingal has her own allure both as a vessel with a distinguished heritage and as a glorious evocation of a glamorous yacht.

29,Australian dollar sinks on prospect of rate cuts,RBA cites rising global economic risks as it opens door to reducing rates,https://www.ft.com/content/94ec47e6-29c8-11e9-a5ab-ff8ef2b976c7,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-06T13:19:30Z,"Australia’s central bank has become the latest to open the door to cutting interest rates, sending the country’s currency to its steepest one-day drop since August and underlining how rapidly expectations for global monetary policy are being upended.
Philip Lowe, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, on Wednesday held out the prospect that the next move in its key interest rate could be lower as risks from the global economy increased and the domestic housing market slowed. The RBA has held its cash rate steady at 1.5 per cent since August 2016.
In a speech in Sydney, Mr Lowe said: “There are now scenarios where the next move in the cash rate is up and other scenarios where it is down” adding that now “the probabilities appear to be more evenly balanced”.
Last week the US Federal Reserve made one of its sharpest pivots in recent memory, distancing itself from December’s projection of another two interest-rate rises this year, as chairman Jay Powell blamed “cross-currents” from China and Europe, trade tensions and the risks of a hard Brexit. Investors are also expecting the European Central Bank to push back its timing of any interest rate increases as the eurozone economy loses momentum.
“Clearly, there was a general desire by central banks last year to join the Fed to try and normalise monetary policy,” said Philip Saunders, co-head of multi-asset at investment firm Investec. However, “you’ve definitely seen a shift in growth expectations, inflation has been more benign than anticipated and people have a better appreciation of the extent to which global demand has depended on China”.
While Mr Lowe said he did not see a “strong case” for a “near-term change” in interest rates, merely putting a cut in borrowing costs on the horizon was enough to send the Australian dollar down 1.4 per cent to 71.34 US cents. The yield on the 10-year Australian government bond dropped 6 basis points to 2.18 per cent, outperforming every other major sovereign debt market.
Paul Brennan, an economist with Citi, said Mr Lowe had called time on the RBA’s bias towards lifting rates with a shift to a neutral bias, but said the central bank was in “no hurry to make judgments about how the economic outlook will unfold this year”. Key to this will be if house prices continue to fall, how that affects the domestic economy and the state of the broader global economy.
The central bank revised down its forecasts for Australian economic growth for 2019 and 2020 by a quarter of a percentage point. Australian house prices fell at their sharpest rate in 35 years in December, bringing the annual decline to 6.1 per cent in December. 
Craig James, chief economist at CommSec, said the significance of the speech was that RBA “now acknowledges that there are risks, that if manifest, could lead to the Reserve Bank cutting rates”. Beyond domestic risks, the health of the Chinese economy was an important factor for Australia, he added. China was a big trading partner for Australia but the US-China trade war had piled on pressure on the Chinese economy."
30,"Consumers Remain Skeptical of Grocery Delivery, While Companies Eye Growth in the Business",A new survey found that American consumers are not adopting online grocery delivery—just 3% of grocery spending takes place online.,http://fortune.com/2019/02/05/grocery-delivery-services-us-adoption/,"{'id': 'fortune', 'name': 'Fortune'}",2019-02-05T16:19:47Z,"Retailers from Walmart to Kroger now offer grocery delivery, angling to compete with Amazon since it acquired Whole Foods in 2017. 
But it doesnt mean consumers are rushing to order groceries online.
According to a new Bain &amp; Co. survey completed in collaboration with Google, just 3% of grocery spending in the U.S. takes place online, compared to much higher levels of e-commerce penetration in areas such as footwear (20%) and consumer electronics (40%). Only 25% of those surveyed tried an online grocery service in the last year and just 6% have consistently ordered groceries online monthly.
Part of the problem is shoppers perception. Some are concerned about being able to determine the best prices when shopping online, while others complain about items being out of stock or delivery drivers being late. 
But perhaps the biggest problem of all? Grocery delivery is intended to save time for the consumer, yet only 42% of those surveyed said the service saved them time.
 With converting shoppers habits already so difficult, the type of experience a consumer has can be the difference between a repeat customer and someone who swears off grocery delivery, according to Bain.
Despite these challenges, Bain expects that groceries will be part of e-commerce growth, which in total is expected to at least triple in the next decade. In order to be part of this boom, online grocery retailers will need to become even more convenient and incorporate features such as shopping lists and price comparison to convert consumers."

But do consumers perceive McDonalds as a socially or environmentally responsible company? If they do not, it is in spite of the best efforts of Bob Langert. In 1988, he took a temporary assignment managing a furore over polystyrene clamshells in which the companys burgers were served, and which were being damned for their contribution to Americas litter problem. That turned into a 25-year career (he has since left the firm) dealing with the chains various negative external effects.
It was a Herculean task, akin to being fashion consultant to Steve Bannon. Apart from litter, he had to deal with animal welfare, environmental destruction, obesity and workers rights. When he began, the companys mascot was being dubbed Ronald McToxic because of the clamshell problem. But he had more success than outsiders might think. His book The Battle to Do Good: Inside McDonalds Sustainability Journey is a must-read even for those who are cynical about the business of corporate social responsibility.
At times, the fast-food chain did not help itself. In the 1990s, it sued two Greenpeace activists for producing leaflets about its practices. The ensuing McLibel trial gave the claims worldwide publicity and was described as the worlds biggest corporate-PR disaster. Mr Langert tried to reduce the damage. The company consulted panels of independent experts and engaged with campaigning groups. On occasion it aimed to keep one step ahead of the activistsMcDonalds took action even when there was little sign of public concern. Shaving one inch off the napkins saved 3m lbs of paper annually, for example, but few consumers noticed.
Environmentalists did attack the firm for its impact on the Amazon rainforest, saying trees were being cut down to make room for cattle pasture or the expansion of soy farming for cattle feed. In 1989 the company announced that it never has and never will buy beef from recently deforested rainforests and it has also worked to limit the expansion of soy farming in the region. The rise of veganism amid doubts about the health effects of eating meat have given McDonalds new worries.
Accomplishing change is not just a matter of the company snapping its fingers. Most McDonalds restaurants are operated by franchisees and its goods are bought from a wide range of suppliers, so three or four layers may separate the McDonalds head office and the cattle-rancher who supplies the firms beef.
In the late 1990s, after complaints from campaign groups about the living conditions of hens, Mr Langert visited an egg facility to find that conditions were indeed terrible. In August 2000 the firm said it would buy eggs only from suppliers that gave hens 72 square inches of space, compared with an industry average of 48 square inches. Suppliers resisted so strongly that McDonalds had to find new sources for its eggs. But those who complied found that the mortality rates of hens decreased and egg-laying rates increased, offsetting the extra costs.
Mr Langert found it took a long time to get agreement within the company on a particular subject and then to persuade suppliers to comply. But once he reached that stage, he had enormous clout; McDonalds is the largest purchaser of beef and pork in America, as well as the second-largest buyer of chicken. Another victory was persuading a supplier to phase out the use of gestation stalls for sows which make it impossible for the animals to move.
Human working conditions also caused the company trouble. One day Mr Langert got a call from a Catholic bishop who was concerned about the low wages paid to tomato-pickers. Another issue was the use of trans fats to cook the restaurants fries, which were deemed to increase the risk of heart disease; it took six years for the chain to phase out the practice. But the company has also added more salads and healthy options.
Was all the effort worth it? It seems likely that many of the people who care a lot about these issues would never eat a fast-food burger in the first place. But Mr Langert did more than most to reduce environmental waste and animal cruelty. A decent career record for an obviously decent man.

BB&amp;T Corp.
and
SunTrust Banks Inc.,
both dominant banks in the South, would be more competitive with a bigger tech budget.The all-stock, $28.2 billion deal, announced Thursday, is expected to help the rivals close a widening digital gap that is fueling one of the biggest threats to their business: losing relevance among younger customers.The deal, which would create the sixth-largest regional bank and a financial powerhouse in the South, underscores the urgency facing regional banks to invest heavily in client-facing and back-end technology to continue attracting consumer and corporate customers.
Whats the largest strategic risk facing the banking industry? Its technology, said Todd Baker, a senior fellow at the Richard Paul Richman Center for Business, Law and Public Policy at Columbia University. How are they going to be more nimble and effective?
The transactionthe biggest bank deal since the financial crisiswill allow the former rivals to develop better technology together than they could on their own. They plan to reinvest $1.6 billion in projected cost savings from the merger into technology and innovation. 
The companies also plan to create an innovation and technology center at the merged entitys new headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., to drive digital transformation, including the adoption of automation and an improved customer experience online.
This is the early innings of an enormous transformation of all of financial services, Mr. Baker said. 
In recent years, big banks such as
JPMorgan Chase
&amp; Co. and
Bank of America Corp.
have invested heavily in developing consumer-facing technology such as artificial intelligence-powered chatbots and digital investing apps. In the process, they also have added deposits at a faster clip than smaller peers.
To understand the challenges regional banks face, consider: BB&amp;T disclosed in November that its technology budget for 2018 was $1.1 billion. BofA, meanwhile, disclosed a total technology budget of about $10 billion. 
The world is changing and we have to change, BB&amp;T Chief Executive Kelly King said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.
The deal also presents an opportunity for cost savings. During a conference call with analysts, executives from both companies said that some of the cuts could come from redundant systems and branch closures. Together, the companies have roughly 740 locations within two miles of each other, according to a presentation. 
Those savings could bolster the tech budget. One of the most powerful benefits of this merger, BB&amp;T Chief Financial Officer Daryl Bible said during the call, is that we are able to take significant costs out of redundant areas and reinvest them into innovation, technology and our talent, ensuring we are better positioned for the future.
Scott Case, currently the chief information officer at SunTrust, is expected to lead technology at the combined company, while Donta Wilson, chief digital officer at BB&amp;T, would lead the companys digital transformation.

34,National Enquirer parent to investigate Bezos allegations,Amazon founder claimed the tabloid attempted to blackmail him,https://www.ft.com/content/5544fb74-2bad-11e9-a5ab-ff8ef2b976c7,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-08T14:59:05Z,"The parent company of National Enquirer on Friday said it “fervently” believes it acted “lawfully” in reporting about Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ personal life and said it would investigate his blackmail allegations. 
American Media Inc’s statement came after Mr Bezos late on Thursday wrote a post on Medium, in which he claimed National Enquirer threatened to publish intimate photos and text messages between him and Lauren Sanchez, the woman he has been dating, unless he called off an investigation into how it obtained the messages. 
The Amazon chief executive also said AMI wanted him to publish a statement denying his claims that the coverage was “influenced by political forces”. 
AMI said on Friday that at the time “of the recent allegations . . . it was in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him.” 
Mr Bezos’ comments marked a sharp escalation of tensions between him and America’s biggest tabloid publisher, which has close connections to President Donald Trump, a frequent and scathing critic of Mr Bezos.
AMI said on Friday that given the “nature of the allegations published by Mr Bezos, the board has convened and determined that it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims. Upon completion of that investigation, the board will take whatever appropriate action is necessary.”"
35,J.C. Penney Will Stop Selling Appliances in Latest Strategy Lurch,"J.C. Penney said on Wednesday it will stop selling appliances, reversing a cornerstone of its strategy since 2016 amid a sales slump.",http://fortune.com/2019/02/06/jcpenney-appliances/,"{'id': 'fortune', 'name': 'Fortune'}",2019-02-06T16:48:14Z,"J.C. Penney(jcp)said on Wednesday it will stop selling appliances in its latest strategy shift aimed at stanching a worsening sales decline.
Penney resumed selling appliances in 2016 for the first time since 1983, as former CEO Marvin Ellison, who had earlier in his career been a senior executive at The Home Depot, sought to take advantage of the ongoing implosion at its mall neighbor, Sears. His bet was that appliances like dishwashers, washing machines, and dryers would reduce Penney’s heavy reliance on apparel and that the big-ticket items would lift margins and sales more quickly than $5 towels. He also tested ideas like home remodeling services and flooring.
But appliance shoppers did not leave Sears, for decades the biggest appliance seller in the country, for Penney; instead they continued to defect to Home Depot, Lowe’s (where Ellison is now CEO after leaving Penney last spring), and Best Buy. (bby) What’s more, shoppers need appliances only every few years, so Ellison’s move, the cornerstone of his strategy, failed to drum up shopper traffic. Penney, which has lurched between strategies frequently in the last decade, will now double down on home goods and clothing. In 1983, when Penney was much more of a general merchandise chain (and the No. 3 U.S. retailer), it ditched appliances to focus on apparel, a much less competitive area than it is today.
“Optimizing the allocation of store space will enable us to prioritize and focus on the Companys legacy strengths in apparel and soft home furnishings, which represent higher margin opportunities,” Penney said in a statement. The news was first reported by Bloomberg.
Penney will continue to sell appliances in stores and online until Feb. 28 and offer free basic delivery and installation on new model purchases over $299. The department store chain will also remove furniture (except mattresses) from its stores but continue to sell it online.
During the key holiday season, Penney saw comparable sales fell 3.5% in a continuation of a poor performance in the fall, all despite a strong consumer spending environment that has lifted its main rivals, notably Macy’s, Target, and Kohl’s. The chain said in January it would close more stores, with a more exact number being disclosed later this month, adding to the 140 stores it closed two years ago. There are also a number of c-suite positions Jill Soltau, CEO since October, has to fix.
J.C. Penney, for decades a leader in home goods, has been trying to figure out how to optimize that key part of the store. In the last seven years, it has conducted two major remodeling programs of the area. In 2006, the category was 20% of Penney sales, but in 2013, that had fallen to 12%. Rivals such as Kohl’s, Target, and TJX’s Home Goods have swooped in to take Penney’s once dominant market share."
36,Tabloid attack sees Jeff Bezos take on Trump,Washington Post owner accuses National Enquirer of blackmail after finding himself in the political crosshairs,https://www.ft.com/content/888a2346-2bc2-11e9-a5ab-ff8ef2b976c7,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-08T19:22:50Z,"The world’s richest man is facing off against the US president. 
Jeff Bezos, the 55-year-old founder of Amazon, has said he is being blackmailed over a series of embarrassing personal photos, and he claimed the motivation was clear. 
In a blog, Mr Bezos accused the National Enquirer, America’s best-known tabloid, of carrying out a political attack, and linked it to President Donald Trump and the Saudi government.
The allegations amplified what began as salacious gossip about how Mr Bezos had left his wife for a new relationship into a story about Washington politics, money, and dirty tricks. 
They also highlighted how Mr Bezos has progressed from an ecommerce billionaire who kept a low profile in Seattle to a target for Mr Trump, as his ambitions, and those of Amazon, put him in the political crosshairs. 
Amazon, now the world’s second most valuable company, has elevated Mr Bezos’ net worth past $130bn. His ownership of the Washington Post, one of the US’s most venerable newspapers, has made him a favourite target of Mr Trump, who regularly rails against the title when it publishes stories that are critical of him.
Mr Bezos acknowledged the tension this week, writing: “My ownership of the Washington Post is a complexifier for me. It’s unavoidable that certain powerful people who experience Washington Post news coverage will wrongly conclude I am their enemy.”
So sorry to hear about Jeff Bozo [sic] being taken down by a competitor
President Trump, January 2019
Chris Allieri, founder of public relations consultancy Mulberry &amp; Astor, said: “Trump and Bezos are two sides of the same coin — extremely rich, very confident, not particularly charitable and love the spotlight. Bezos is playing into Trump’s game of taking feuds online and doing so very publicly.” 
He added that Amazon’s market strength — and its low rates of pay for many workers — had intensified public scrutiny of the company. “Amazon and Bezos specifically have made tons of money and with that comes scrutiny. In the court of public opinion, when some of your workers are on food stamps and you buy $10m Super Bowl ads extolling the virtues of a free press, that won’t land well with many people.” 
In recent years Amazon has had to dramatically increase the size of its lobbying team in Washington to deal with a growing array of problems, over taxation, wages and its effect on American retail. 
And in what may be its most politically sensitive manoeuvring, Amazon is competing for a $10bn US defence contract as the Pentagon plans a shift in data storage and processing power to the cloud. The Pentagon has said it will award the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure project, known as JEDI, in April to a single bidder — a decision seen to favour Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud computing arm, which is vying with Microsoft and Oracle for the deal. 
Mr Trump’s elevation to the White House — thanks in part to the support of AMI and its chief executive David Pecker — has added a new dimension. The president blames Amazon for the budget woes of the US Postal Service and has threatened antitrust action.
When news of Mr Bezos’s affair with Lauren Sanchez broke last month, following an investigation by the National Enquirer, Mr Trump responded on Twitter in typical — and insulting — fashion.“So sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo [sic] being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post,” he wrote, adding that he hoped “the paper will soon be placed in better &amp; more responsible hands!”
Being criticised by Mr Trump does not appear to have hurt the Post, which was acquired by Mr Bezos in 2013 — and which has added more subscribers in the two years since Mr Trump became president. In its last publicly available numbers in 2017 the title said it had passed the 1m mark for digital-only subscribers; in November 2018 the company said its subscriber base had tripled in the past two years but did not provide a number.
Mr Bezos’s backing has been a big factor in recent editorial successes, according to Ken Doctor of Newsonomics, a news industry analyst. “He has brought the Post back to its previous impact and importance in American society which is no small feat in only five-and-a-half years.”
The newsroom has expanded from an editorial staff of 500 when he bought the paper to more than 800 and although Mr Bezos is interested in the paper’s operations he has been careful not to stray into influencing its editorial coverage, Mr Doctor said.
“The way he exercises his ownership is with three people: the editor, publisher and chief technology officer. But that is about how the business is moving forward and not about editorial or editorial page content.”
In contrast to the Post’s coverage, the National Enquirer has been a staunch supporter of Mr Trump, publishing laudatory stories with headlines such as “Donald Trump’s The One!” during the presidential campaign. Mr Trump and Mr Pecker are longtime friends having met decades ago through friends in Florida, where both men have homes. 
In the 1990s Mr Pecker published a magazine called Trump Style — based on the real estate developer’s gold-plated sensibilities. The president has been as effusive in his praise of Mr Pecker as he has been critical of Mr Bezos: six years ago he tweeted that he would be a “brilliant choice” to become chief executive of Time magazine, saying “no one could bring it back like David!”
As well as publishing flattering stories about Mr Trump during his presidential campaign, Mr Pecker offered to find, buy and suppress negative stories, an arrangement known as “catch and kill”. This attracted the interest of the US justice department and in December, AMI reached an agreement with the department to avoid prosecution for paying off the former playboy model Karen McDougal to prevent her from making “damaging allegations” about Mr Trump before the 2016 election.
In his blog post Mr Bezos also speculated that AMI had worked “on behalf of the 
Saudi government”. He linked to a New York Times report that Mr Pecker had pursued business and financing from Saudi Arabia and an Associated Press story about a glossy magazine AMI produced about the kingdom. AMI said it would investigate the allegations. 
The Amazon chief said he was making public correspondence he had received from AMI’s chief content officer and lawyer to push back against their “extortionate proposal”. He said the tabloid was threatening to publish intimate photos and text messages between him and Ms Sanchez unless he called off an investigation into how they had obtained the material and disavowed claims that AMI’s coverage was politically motivated.
“These communications cement AMI’s long-earned reputation for weaponising journalistic privileges, hiding behind important protections, and ignoring the tenets and purpose of true journalism,” he wrote. 
“Of course I don’t want personal photos published, but I also won’t participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks and corruption.”
He added: “Any personal embarrassment AMI could cause me takes a back seat because there’s a much more important matter involved here. If in my position I can’t stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can?”"
37,A 25-year battle to improve the image of McDonald’s,Do you want ethics with that?,https://www.economist.com/business/2019/02/05/a-25-year-battle-to-improve-the-image-of-mcdonalds,"{'id': 'the-economist', 'name': 'The Economist'}",2019-02-05T00:00:00Z,"EVERY DAY McDonalds serves 69m customers, more than the population of Britain or France. The company has what is estimated to be the most valuable fast-food brand in the world, cherished as a cheap dining option for families.
But do consumers perceive McDonalds as a socially or environmentally responsible company? If they do not, it is in spite of the best efforts of Bob Langert. In 1988, he took a temporary assignment managing a furore over polystyrene clamshells in which the companys burgers were served, and which were being damned for their contribution to Americas litter problem. That turned into a 25-year career (he has since left the firm) dealing with the chains negative external effects.

It was a Herculean task, akin to being fashion consultant to Steve Bannon. Apart from litter, he had to deal with animal welfare, environmental destruction, obesity and workers rights. When he began, the companys mascot was being dubbed Ronald McToxic because of the clamshell problem. But he had more success than outsiders might think. His book The Battle to Do Good: Inside McDonalds Sustainability Journey is a must-read even for those who are cynical about the business of corporate social responsibility (CSR).
At times, the fast-food chain did not help itself. In the 1990s, it sued two Greenpeace activists for producing leaflets about its practices. The ensuing McLibel trial gave the claims worldwide publicity and was described as the worlds biggest corporate PR disaster. Mr Langert tried to reduce the damage. The company consulted panels of independent experts and engaged with campaigning groups. On occasion it aimed to keep one step ahead of the activistsMcDonalds took action even when there was little sign of public concern. Shaving one inch off the napkins saved 3m lbs of paper annually, for example, but few consumers noticed. 
Environmentalists did attack the firm for its impact on the Amazon rainforest, saying trees were being cut down to make room for cattle pasture or the expansion of soy farming for cattle feed. In 1989 the company announced that it never has and never will buy beef from recently deforested rainforests and it has also worked to limit the expansion of soy farming in the region. The rise of veganism amid doubts about the health effects of eating meat have given the company new worries.
Accomplishing change is not just a matter of the company snapping its fingers. Most McDonalds restaurants are operated by franchisees and its goods are bought from a wide range of suppliers, so three or four layers may separate the McDonalds head office and the cattle rancher who supplies the firms beef.
In the late 1990s, after complaints from campaign groups about the living conditions of hens, Mr Langert visited an egg facility and found that conditions were indeed terrible. In August 2000 the company said it would buy eggs only from suppliers that gave hens 72 square inches of space, compared with an industry average of 48 square inches. Suppliers resisted so strongly that the company had to find new sources for its eggs. But the suppliers who complied found that the mortality rates of hens decreased and egg-laying rates increased, offsetting the extra costs. 
Mr Langert found it took a long time to get agreement within the company on a particular subject and then to persuade suppliers to comply. But once he reached that stage, he had enormous clout; McDonalds is the largest purchaser of beef and pork in America, as well as the second-largest buyer of chicken. He persuaded a supplier to phase out the use of gestation stalls for sows which make it impossible for the animals to move.
Human conditions also caused the company trouble. One day Mr Langert got a call from a Catholic bishop who was concerned about the low wages paid to tomato-pickers. Another issue was the use of trans fats to cook the restaurants fries, which were deemed to increase the risk of heart disease; it took six years for the chain to phase out the practice. But the company has also added more salads and healthy options.
Was all the effort worth it? It seems likely that people who care a lot about these issues would never eat a fast-food burger in the first place. But Mr Langert did more than most to reduce environmental waste and animal cruelty. A decent career record for an obviously decent man."

Hulu Chief Marketing Officer Kelly Campbell said in a statement that the ad for The Handmaids Tale reflects the shows focus on the relationship between those in charge and those who arent, which happens to reflect conversations taking place in todays environment.
Two-thirds of consumers consider the Super Bowl an inappropriate place for advertisers to make political statements, according to a poll conducted online last month by survey tech company Morning Consult for CMO Today.

39,U.S. Says Americans Can Buy Venezuelan Oil Until April 28,"The U.S. will allow Americans to buy oil and oil products from Venezuela’s state oil company until April 28, the Treasury Department said Friday.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-says-americans-can-buy-venezuelan-oil-until-april-28-11549060333,"{'id': 'the-wall-street-journal', 'name': 'The Wall Street Journal'}",2019-02-01T22:32:15Z,"The U.S. will allow Americans to buy oil and oil products from Venezuelas state oil company until April 28, the Treasury Department said Friday. The authorization came as part of guidance released after the U.S. imposed sanctions Monday on Petróleos de Venezuela SA, or PdVSA. The sanctions are the culmination of a two-year U.S. campaign to pressure the Venezuelan government led by President Nicolás Maduro to leave power and to exert greater influence over Latin America. Complying with the sanctions, however, may pose a challenge for companies and individuals, sanctions attorneys said, citing how interconnected PdVSA is with the U.S. economy.The Treasurys guidance, which came in the form of a frequently-asked-questions document, addressed a range of complicated issues that have arisen since the sanctions were imposed.
Among them: How to properly handle the trading of bonds issued by PdVSA, authorizations for which are complex. We recommend caution, Glen Kelley, a partner at the international trade-focused law firm Jacobson Burton Kelley PLLC, said in an email.
The 90-day clock on purchases by Americans of oil and oil products from PdVSA, or any entity majority owned by the company, is more straightforward. They can buy the oil, so long as the payments are made into a blocked, interest-bearing account in the U.S., until April 28. After that, such purchases are prohibited without authorization from the Treasury.
That authorization also covers Citgo Petroleum Corp., one of the largest oil refiners in the U.S. and a subsidiary of PdVSA-owned holding company. Citgo is considering bankruptcy as one way to protect its operations. U.S. officials have said they are working to ensure Citgo stays in business.
Despite the authorizations, PdVSA is unlikely to sell any crude to Americans because of the requirement for the buyer to pay into a blocked account the Venezuelan company doesnt control, according to Vera de Gyarfas, a partner at law firm King &amp; Spalding LLP, whose practice focuses on energy project-related transactions in Latin America and Africa.
PdVSA couldnt be reached for comment. A person familiar with Citgos operations said the companys outlook is positive and the Treasurys licenses permit normal operations. There has been no effect thus far on the companys cash position or liquidity, the person added.
PdVSA is a critical revenue source for Venezuela. U.S. officials said Monday when imposing the sanctions that the company also has been a vehicle for embezzlement and corruption by Venezuelan business leaders and politicians. When imposing the sanctions, U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said the move would block $7 billion in assets.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday the path to sanctions relief for PdVSA is to transfer control of the company to opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who the U.S. recognizes as the rightful president of Venezuela, or to a subsequent democratically elected government.
The sanctions on PdVSA may best be viewed as a protective measure designed to safeguard Venezuelan state assets until they can be delivered to a government not led by Mr. Maduro, according to a client note issued Thursday by law firm Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP.
The Treasury appears to be following a playbook it developed years ago when imposing sanctions on Iraq and Libya to preserve assets in the grasp of a dictator, the note said.
The challenge in Venezuela is that PdVSA is much bigger and far more intertwined in the U.S., giving rise to potential domestic collateral consequences in the United States that were far more limited in the case of Libya and Kuwait, the note said.

The first strike is expected on Thursday, when Germany’s Federal Cartel office, the country’s antitrust watchdog, publishes its findings from a three-year-long investigation into whether Facebook’s ability to collect huge amounts of data harms competition.
In an interim ruling in 2017, the German authorities said Facebook had been allowed to “limitlessly amass every kind of data generated by using third-party websites and merge it with the user’s Facebook account [including] WhatsApp or Instagram”. Last week, Facebook announced it plans to unify the messaging services of the three apps into one system by 2020. 
The German regulator is expected to lay down new rules about how Facebook should process third-party data, and the report is seen as a harbinger of broader European plans to overhaul competition law to acknowledge the power of the Silicon Valley tech companies. 
By February 14 at the latest we need to complete this process. They way things are it is looking a bit tough”, 
Axel Voss, a centre-right MEP
“We are blazing a trail in this case,” said Andreas Mundt, head of the Federal Cartel Office to the FT last year. “We are looking very closely at the connection between data and market dominance, data and market power, and the possible abuse of data collection.” 
He added at the time that the agency could even “ban [Facebook] from collecting and processing certain third-party user data”.
EU competition regulators have said data hoarding could be considered anti-competitive and EU commissioner Margrethe Vestager has put together a task force of academics to produce a report on the topic by the end of March.
“We’re already looking very closely at whether companies are using their control of data to harm competition. We need to be sure that the competition rules are ready for a world where data becomes even more vital,” said Ms Vestager at a lecture in Cambridge on Monday. 
“We can choose products from millions of sellers, find news from every country in the world. But all those sites are funnelled to us through just a handful of platforms — the search engines that [help] us find different offers for a product, the online marketplaces where buyers meet sellers, the news aggregators that collect stories from around the web,” she added, in a loosely veiled reference to Google, Amazon and Facebook.
She has also stated that she is looking at how Amazon uses third-party data, and whether that leads to unfair competition. On Monday, she said the probe was at a “very early stage” and that there had been no decision yet on whether Amazon had done anything wrong.
Mirroring the Facebook probe, the German antitrust watchdog has launched its own investigation into Amazon’s “double role” as a retailer and marketplace for sellers, on whether the company abused its market power to set illegal contract terms. German officials have said their probe supplements the EU’s work.
EU governments in Brussels on Friday will try to reach a deal on how to update Europe’s copyright rules, paving the way for an agreement with EU parliament members next week.
The directive, the first update of EU copyright law in nearly 20 years, is designed to level the playing field between content creators, such as publishers and artists, and the platforms they are increasingly reliant on in the digital age.
The current draft version holds internet companies directly responsible for any copyright infringement in the content shared on their platforms.
This would leave YouTube responsible for negotiating licenses with all the copyright holders of all its content, while Google News would have to buy licenses to host newspaper articles or be unable to show excerpts. 
Susan Wojcicki, YouTube’s chief executive, has said the introduction of the liability regime in Europe would mean “EU residents are at risk of being cut off from videos that, in just the past month, they viewed more than 90bn times”.
Richard Gingras, vice-president of Google News, has warned that “the possibility of us shutting down the Google News service in the EU is very real” if the copyright directive is agreed.
After nearly two years of negotiations, the copyright rules are still being fought over by member states. On Friday, they will make a last-ditch attempt to agree on a compromise text — and whether it should apply to smaller tech companies — to get a final agreement by next week. Should negotiations break down, there is a chance the directive cannot be passed before European Parliament elections in May.
“By February 14 at the latest we need to complete this process. They way things are it is looking a bit tough,” Axel Voss, the centre-right MEP in charge of agreeing a deal said earlier this week.

Funds that target a specific level of market movement automatically change their exposure according to the ebb and flow of financial turbulence. Last year’s turmoil caused many to dump equities, and fuel the sell-off, critics argue.
However, with the benchmark S&amp;P 500 recording its best January since 1987, these “volatility control” strategies are buying once again. Deutsche Bank estimates that funds following these strategies have already bought $45bn of US stocks in January. A further $45bn of buying could come in the next three months as long as markets remain calm, according to the bank.
“It’s quite a big chunk of assets,” said Hallie Martin, a US equity strategist at Deutsche Bank, reversing selling seen during December’s market turmoil. “When volatility increases they de-allocate from equities, which is what we saw in the fourth quarter.”
Wells Fargo’s analysts estimate volatility-targeting strategies will buy $10bn to $20bn in US equities monthly, and as much as $160bn could come back into stocks over the year, should the volatility remain muted.
“If the current status quo persists and the high volatility of December fades into the background you’ll see these strategies allocate into equities,” Pravit Chintawongvanich, equity derivatives strategist for Wells Fargo, pointed out.
There are three primary types of volatility-sensitive strategies: risk parity funds, such as the likes of Bridgewater’s All-Weather fund; trend-following hedge funds that attempt to surf market momentum up and down; and “variable annuity” insurance accounts with a fixed volatility target.
The trend-following hedge fund industry manages about $300bn, and the volatility-sensitive variable annuity side is roughly similar in size. Estimates for the size of the risk parity industry vary wildly, but are generally in the $200bn to $600bn range.
Their systematic, volatility-sensitive trading has become controversial, with critics arguing that their automated selling when markets are already tumbling can accentuate vicious swings. Several fund managers blamed managed-volatility funds for aggravating the turmoil that struck markets at the end of last year, and in several other flashes of turmoil in recent years, such as in February 2018 and August 2015.
In practice, there is tremendous variety in just how sensitive these strategies are to volatility, ranging from quicker-responding variable annuity products to more ponderous risk parity funds. Industry insiders argue that critics also overestimate how much trading they actually do.
But many volatility-targeting strategies calculate volatility based on one-month and three-month windows, meaning that the longer the market edges away from December’s ructions, the more buying will occur, analysts say.
One-month realised volatility nudged higher in January than any point in 2018 as December’s stock market woes pushed the figure to 29.7 per cent. The figure has since softened to under 25 per cent.
This burst of volatility-sensitive buying, coupled with a still-rosy outlook for corporate share buybacks, will inject more money into the equity market and keep the rally going, according to Ms Martin.
However, Mr Chintawongvanich warned that this will not be enough to stem a renewed stock market tumble, should corporate or economic data disappoint.
“We’re at the point where it doesn’t look like we’re going to enter a recession soon, but the likelihood has increased,” he said. “If economic data gets worse then markets will turn down.”"

45,How one London wine bar helped Brazil to cut crime,Facial recognition system in Rio’s biggest mall was developed in Gordon’s Wine Bar,https://www.ft.com/content/605de54a-1e90-11e9-b126-46fc3ad87c65,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-08T04:00:26Z,"Cameras scan the faces of shoppers in the biggest mall in Rio de Janeiro, pinging alerts to the mobile phones of shop assistants if they recognise known shoplifters. 
If it spots anyone wanted for a serious crime, the system calls the police. 
The facial recognition program is being rolled out across Brazil this year, including in football stadiums, other shopping centres and gyms, but it began life in Gordon’s Wine Bar, a Victorian drinking cellar on the north bank of the Thames in London.
When 62-year-old Simon Gordon inherited the bar from his father in 2003, he was struck by the rampant pickpocketing that took place in its candlelit interior. 
“We had 15 crimes every month, two of my friends had their wallets stolen while I was having lunch with them,” he said. “They came in spates and the police could not deal with them, they just did not have the resources.” So, in 2010, he decided he would take action himself. 
Today the company he set up, Facewatch, is being tested by a major UK supermarket chain, several major events venues and even a prison. It uses off-the-shelf facial recognition software to match criminals against police watch lists, and against watch lists compiled by its customers. 
In Brazil, it has been used by three commercial centres since last May and was lauded by Wilson Witzel, the governor of Rio de Janeiro who was an early supporter of Jair Bolsonaro and echoes the president’s tough-on-crime rhetoric. Mr Witzel said in January that he plans to allow the police to share their watch lists of members of organised crime suspects with facial recognition companies.

“In December alone, we captured 2.75m faces [in Brazil] and reduced crime overall by 70 per cent. We even caught one of the top 10 criminals from Interpol’s Most Wanted list, which had been uploaded to our watch lists,” said Mr Gordon. 
The first incarnation of Facewatch was a tool that allowed customers to upload footage of crimes captured on CCTV and send it to the police. 
Mr Gordon, who trained as an accountant, built the system with three friends from his village in Hampshire and launched it with 50 retailers in the area around London’s Victoria railway station, including Co-op Food. 
By 2016, more than 20 police forces were working with Facewatch, but cuts to their budgets meant they had few resources to investigate the incidents being uploaded. “There was no point reporting low-level crime, if the police weren’t responding,” said Mr Gordon. 
But at that point, facial recognition software was starting to become widely available, thanks to advances in artificial intelligence, and Mr Gordon decided to try it out on the £3,000 camera system installed in his wine bar. 
“When we first started, faces were really technically difficult to identify in real time, and very expensive to do, you needed powerful processors that most people couldn’t afford,” Mr Gordon said. “Our idea has coincided beautifully with facial recognition technology becoming market-ready, it’s 20 times faster than it was three years ago.”
Simon Gordon: 'We have so little crime now, that we hardly have anyone left on our watchlist' © Charlie Bibby/FT
In 2017, the company, which has just raised £2.5m in seed funding, brought on a new chief executive, Nick Fisher, to sell its alert system across the UK and Brazil. 
Start-ups like Facewatch, and others such as US companies StopLift and FaceFirst, which supply to large retailers including Walmart and Saks Fifth Avenue, have benefited from the huge recent strides in machine learning, the technology by which computers can learn to recognise faces or objects by training on large data sets. Consumer giants such as Amazon and Microsoft sell their own facial recognition tools to developers to integrate into new apps. 
Facewatch’s system uses an algorithm from US company RankOne to match faces seen in real time by in-store cameras with watch lists of known criminals. 
The process takes a few seconds, and if a match is found, the business owner is notified by a mobile alert. Facewatch is about to sign data-sharing deals with the Metropolitan Police and the City of London police, and is in talks with Hampshire police and Sussex police. 
“The deal with police is they give us face data of low-level criminals and they can have a separate watchlist for more serious criminals that they plug in,” said Mr Gordon. If the systems spots a serious criminal, the alert is sent directly to the police, rather than to retailers. 
Facewatch plans to charge roughly £2,000 per camera for a three-year licence, but said it is in “beta” mode, with most of its customers trialling its products. 
Humber prison, in north-east England, is using the system to spot prolific drug smugglers, said Mr Gordon. 
“Rory Stewart, minister for prisons, allocated £10m to 10 prisons in the north and said he would resign in 12 months if he didn’t reduce drugs in those prisons. Our trial in Humber ends this month and then they’ll test it at the others. You put this in multiple prisons and you can spot the same people going round all the time,” said Mr Gordon. 
Today, he does not spend much time running his wine bar, which he only visits twice a week, he said. 
“We are, of course, using Facewatch there, and we now have one crime a month maximum, it’s dramatic,” he said. Stuck up behind the bar is a poster of five faces. “We have so little crime now, that we hardly have anyone left on our watchlist.”"

""We know Target is such a core part of [our core customer's] weekly shopping experience,"" Allie Melnick, general manager of Flamingo, told CNBC. She said the brand completed survey work before it determined this would be a ""natural collaboration."" In many big-box stores, the heavily trafficked aisles that sell razors and other body care for women ""haven't been touched"" by old-school brands in a really long time, presenting an opportunity for Flamingo to move into retail, Melnick added.
Target has inked a handful of similar deals with so-called digitally native brands including Casper for mattresses, Native for deodorant, Harry's for men's shaving essentials, Quip for electronic toothbrushes and Bark for dog toys. The approach is somewhat different than that of one of Target's biggest competitors, Walmart, which has gone the way of outright buying some of these digitally native brands, like Bonobos and Moosejaw. (Walmart did start selling Harry's razors in its stores last year, after Target.)
Another retailer going the same route as Target is Nordstrom. The department store chain has lined up a series of brands in recent months including sneaker maker Allbirds, luggage retailer Away and Casper to sell in its stores, often for a limited period of time. The news has helped generate buzz and pull shoppers in who want to test out those products offline. Unlike Flamingo and Harry's, though, Allbirds, Away and Casper already have their own stores and are growing that network today.
Tie-ups between traditional retailers and these up-and-comers make sense for a number of reasons, including the fact that the collaboration can help young brands decide if they should open their own standalone stores as a next step, according to Jake Mendel, of Silicon Valley Bank's Early Stage Practice in New York. Many of these brands born on the internet bring with them cult-like followings huge Instagram audiences that legacy retailers like Target and Walmart can potentially piggyback on, Mendel added.
""Big retailers are acutely aware that direct-to-consumer brands are building close and authentic relationships with their customers, which seems to be driving a willingness to be more flexible on terms than they have historically,"" he said.
It's also worth noting a lot of these tie-ups thus far have been in the consumer-packaged-goods space for things like razors, toothbrushes and deodorant.
""If you're selling a product with a low absolute dollar margin, even if your gross margins are insane, you still need to move a lot of volume to build a large scale business,"" Mendel said. ""With [the large majority] of consumer sales still happening through retail channels, these partnerships are a great way to reach large volumes very quickly."""
47,Jeff Bezos alleges blackmail threat from National Enquirer,Amazon chief accuses tabloid’s American Media parent company of extortion,https://www.ft.com/content/ce08d542-2b2d-11e9-a5ab-ff8ef2b976c7,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-08T00:03:39Z,"Jeff Bezos has accused the National Enquirer and its parent company, American Media Inc, of “extortion and blackmail” in its reporting over his personal life.
The Amazon founder and chief executive wrote in an extraordinary post, on the Medium website, that the tabloid had threatened to publish intimate photos and text messages between him and Lauren Sanchez, the woman he has been dating, unless he put out a statement denying AMI’s coverage “was politically motivated or influenced by political forces”.
After Mr Bezos announced last month that he was divorcing his wife of 25 years, MacKenzie Bezos, the National Enquirer published a series of stories revealing his relationship with Ms Sanchez, a former news presenter, including text messages between the couple.
The tabloid claimed Mr Bezos had only made his divorce public after learning it was preparing to publish its story, which it said was the product of months of tracking Mr Bezos and Ms Sanchez. Mr Bezos hired investigators to look into how the Enquirer had obtained the texts.
The involvement of AMI had raised suspicions of political motivations. David Pecker, AMI’s chief executive, is a longtime friend and supporter of President Donald Trump, a frequent critic of Mr Bezos.
In December, American Media reached an agreement with the US justice department enabling it to avoid prosecution for paying off a woman to prevent her from making “damaging allegations” about Mr Trump before the 2016 election.
In his post, Mr Bezos included what he said were emails from Dylan Howard, AMI’s chief content officer, and Jon Fine, AMI’s deputy general counsel. The message from Mr Howard described the photos the tabloid had obtained. 
Mr Fine’s message was a list of “proposed terms” between AMI, Mr Bezos and Gavin de Becker, his investigator, to reach “a full and complete mutual release of all claims”.
It included a provision that Mr Bezos and Mr de Becker would issue “a public, mutually-agreed upon acknowledgment from the Bezos Parties, released through a mutually-agreeable news outlet, affirming that they have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that AM’s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces, and an agreement that they will cease referring to such a possibility.”
Mr Bezos said he was making the correspondence public to defy AMI’s tactics. “Of course I don’t want personal photos published, but I also won’t participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks, and corruption. I prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out,” he wrote.
An Amazon spokesman confirmed Mr Bezos had written the post. Mr Howard, Mr Fine, and a representative for AMI did not respond to requests for comment."

49,Analysis | The U.S. Cut Taxes. Why Will Fewer Folks Get Refunds? - Washington Post,U.S. taxpayers are filing their first returns under the 2017 tax code overhaul that lowered rates for most people. What makes the paperwork headaches tolerable for many is the promise of a tax refund at the finish line. Yet more taxpayers will end up with no …,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-09/the-u-s-cut-taxes-why-will-fewer-folks-get-refunds-quicktake,"{'id': 'bloomberg', 'name': 'Bloomberg'}",2019-02-09T08:01:18Z,"U.S. taxpayers are filing their first returns under the 2017 tax code overhaul that lowered rates for most people. What makes the paperwork headaches tolerable for many is the promise of a tax refund at the finish line. Yet more taxpayers will end up with no refund, or a smaller one, compared with a year ago, before the lower rates fully took effect. How could that be? The explanation rests with the many other changes that made it into the revised tax code. Some Americans are venting their surprise and anger.
1. What were the other changes?
The overhaul pushed through by Trumps fellow Republicans in Congress did much more than lower rates for individuals and companies. It also eliminated some valuable tax breaks used by taxpayers to trim their bills, enhanced a tax credit bestowed on families with children and created brand-new benefits for certain taxpayers, such as business owners. Many people who live in high tax states, such as New York, New Jersey and California, will be able to write off only a fraction of what they pay in state and local taxes. Someone who travels frequently for work, but doesnt have mileage covered, could owe more in taxes because theres no longer a deduction for non-reimbursed business expenses. Everything considered, though, a clear majority of Americans -- four out of five, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington -- were supposed to see a reduction in taxes.
2. Then why arent there lots more refunds?
The Internal Revenue Service offers ongoing guidance to help employees and employers decide how much money to withhold from paychecks so that most income taxes are paid automatically and gradually throughout the year. The shifting tax brackets -- they now start at 10 percent and top out at 37 percent for income about $500,000 -- plus changes to exemptions, deductions and credits meant that many taxpayers needed to adjust their withholding. But most taxpayers were confused how to do so, according to tax adviser H&amp;R Block Inc. (The IRS reworked its calculations, but the updated tables didnt translate precisely from the old law.) Home Depot Inc. found that only 1 percent of its employees had altered their withholding.
3. Whats the outlook for tax refunds?
The IRS expects to issue 105.8 million refunds this year, down 2 percent from last years 108.3 million. According to Ernie Tedeschi, a former Treasury Department economist who analyzed the topic for research firm Evercore ISI, many taxpayers with incomes below $100,000 will get their tax cut in the form of a bigger refund, while those with higher incomes got the tax cut in the form of higher paychecks throughout 2018 -- and therefore might be expecting refunds that arent coming. Analysts anticipate the total dollar amount refunded to be slightly higher, meaning some people will get bigger refunds than in the past. Among them are couples with children, since the standard deductions for filing as a couple, as well as the child tax credit, both almost doubled in the revised tax code.
4. Who wont be getting a refund at all?
More than 30 million Americans -- 21 percent of taxpayers -- didnt have enough taken out of their paychecks throughout the year, meaning they will owe the IRS will they file their returns this year, according to a study from the Government Accountability Office. Thats an increase from 18 percent of taxpayers who were under-withheld last year. That means about 5 million people who got a refund last year wont be getting one this year.
5. Whos angry?
Some taxpayers have turned to Twitter to vent their unhappiness after completing their tax returns and seeing the bottom line. A representative sample: I filed my 2018 tax return today as a substitute teacher. My refund will be 40% less than the refund I got last year.
6. What does this mean for consumer spending?
Despite fewer tax refunds overall, Wall Street analysts are expecting to see a boost in spending from the lower-income consumers who will benefit from the expansion of the child tax credit. Middle-income households, those earning from $55,000 to $75,000 a year, will also see benefits, with as much as half of their tax-cut bounty showing up in refunds, Wells Fargo said. The tax-cut sugar high could be short lived, however, the Congressional Budget Office said the effects of the tax cuts are set to wane in the coming quarters.
7. What are the political ramifications of this?
Fewer people getting refunds will give U.S. Democrats, who now hold a majority in the House of Representatives, an opening to question how much the tax law benefited the middle class. Only about 45 percent of voters approve of the tax cut, according to recent polls, and many Republicans in high-tax states already lost their seats in the 2018 midterm elections due to the changes in the deductibility of state and local taxes. Looking ahead to the 2020 presidential election, dissatisfaction with the tax law gives Democrats an opening to promise tax changes of their own, ones that favor the middle class at the expense of the wealthy.

Andrew Cuomo was responding to a Washington Post report that the ecommerce group was reconsidering the New York investment it announced with great fanfare only three months ago because of local hostility to its plans.
“I understand politics very well. But I’ve never seen a more absurd situation where political pandering and obvious pandering so defeats a bona fide economic development project,” Mr Cuomo said, lacerating his opponents as irresponsible opportunists guilty of “governmental malpractice”.
Andrew Cuomo’s typical behaviour involves lobbing personal attacks when he can’t get his way
Michael Gianaris, Democratic state senator who has criticised the Amazon agreement
Amazon did not directly address the report. In a statement, the company said it was “focused on engaging with our new neighbours” and — through its community investments — “working hard to demonstrate what kind of neighbour we will be”.
Some people familiar with the negotiations expressed surprise at the report — although they suggested it might be helpful in refocusing what has become a heated debate in New York.
While Amazon has been warmly embraced in Virginia, the other destination it chose for a new second headquarters after a highly public nationwide search, it has prompted a backlash in Queens that the company and its local advisers had not anticipated.
Amazon executives have been publicly lambasted in a series of recent city council meetings, where officials have seized on the new helipad demanded by the company — presumably for the use of its billionaire founder, Jeff Bezos.
Complaints about the deal have ranged from the $3bn in tax incentives promised by city and state officials to lure a company that many believe would have come to New York anyway to the disruption to a neighbourhood already strained by gentrification. Leftwing activists, many affiliated with the Democratic Socialists of America, have mounted an energetic ground campaign.
People close to Mr Cuomo, who championed the deal as “the largest economic development transaction in the state’s history”, initially dismissed the opposition as local politicians seeking their share of the limelight. 
But they have grown more alarmed after a turn of events this week in which they were outflanked by members of their own party and the deal appeared to be put in real jeopardy.
The Democratic-controlled New York Senate appointed a Queens representative, Michael Gianaris, who has been an outspoken critic of the agreement, to a seat on a state board that would give him effective veto power over the pact.
Mr Gianaris then proposed legislation that would prevent Amazon from taking advantage of new “opportunity zone” tax benefits for investments in deprived neighbourhoods. The rapidly gentrifying Long Island City area of Queens where Amazon is planning to build its new second headquarters was decreed such a neighbourhood by the governor even though it does not otherwise fit the socio-economic criteria.
“Andrew Cuomo’s typical behaviour involves lobbing personal attacks when he can’t get his way,” Mr Gianaris told the Financial Times. “He should stop throwing tantrums and focus on the fact that he cut a secretive deal that’s bad for New York.” 
A recent poll commissioned by Amazon found that more than 70 per cent of Queens residents supported the deal, which promises to bring 25,000 new jobs to the area over the next 10 years.
Mr Cuomo’s aides believe there is time to win the public argument before the state is scheduled to give final approval to the deal in 2020. They are convinced that Mr Gianaris and other Democratic opponents are seeking to protect themselves against a challenge from the party’s ascendant progressive wing, led by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the recently elected US representative.
Ms Ocasio-Cortez, whose congressional district takes in part of Queens, was critical of the deal soon after it was announced, noting Amazon’s opposition to labour unions.
Mr Cuomo allowed that some Queens residents had “valid, bona fide concerns” about escalating rents and other Amazon effects. But other opponents, he said, were “ideologically based. Amazon is rich, Jeff Bezos is rich, we shouldn’t offer them any incentives”.
The governor added: “It is a very small nucleus and it’s a very small group of politicians who are pandering to the local politics. The problem is the state Senate has adopted that position. And that’s what could stop Amazon. And if they do, I would not want to be a Democratic senator coming back to my district to explain why Amazon left.”"

58,Ocado shares fall further after warehouse fire ignites investor angst,Blaze at flagship facility prompts officials to evacuate ‘immediate area’ overnight,https://www.ft.com/content/433dbc0a-2ac1-11e9-88a4-c32129756dd8,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-07T10:38:59Z,"Shares in Ocado fell 7 per cent on Thursday as firefighters continued to battle the effects of a fire that broke out at the online retailer and technology provider’s flagship robot-powered warehouse on Tuesday. 
Ocado, whose share price has fallen 15 per cent since Tuesday morning, when the fire broke out at the site in Andover where it showcases the proprietary automated warehouse technology that it sells to retailers across the globe, said the Hampshire police had evacuated the “immediate area” on Wednesday evening. 
The evacuation had now been lifted, the Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service said. This followed an evening where people living around the Andover warehouse had been sent to hotels.
Images shared on Twitter by local residents and emergency services on Wednesday showed smoke billowing out of the entire roof area of the warehouse. The site’s roof has now mostly collapsed. 
Ocado’s Andover site is one of its four main depots, which it calls customer fulfilment centres, that send food for delivery to its hubs across the UK. The group delivers food for supermarket groups Waitrose and Wm Morrison, and has also developed proprietary technology at Andover where robots travel on grids to pick food items out of boxes. Based partially on the success of Andover, Ocado has won contracts to build similar facilities for Casino of France, Sobeys of Canada and Kroger of the US, with the deals contributing to a major run-up in its stock market valuation over the past year. 
Since Tuesday, however, the shares have dropped from £10.40 to £9.01 as investors took fright at the scale of the blaze. Because Andover handles around a tenth of Ocado’s orders, the online grocer warned on Wednesday that being forced to close the site would hit its sales as it became potentially unable to serve all of its customers. Ocado is, however, working to increase capacity at its other sites. 
The online retail group said on Thursday that police had evacuated the area around its Andover site because of “concerns over the presence of pressurised refrigerants on site”. 
The group added that it had also sent Ocado vans with “food, drink, nappies and other essentials” to local residents affected by the evacuation."
59,Ocado warns fire at key facility will hit sales growth,More than 200 firefighters tackled the blaze in Hampshire overnight,https://www.ft.com/content/ba55f476-29ed-11e9-a5ab-ff8ef2b976c7,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-06T09:41:20Z,"Ocado has reported serious fire damage, including a collapsed roof, at its flagship automated warehouse in Hampshire that it developed to sell its online retailing technology to customers around the globe. 
The group — which has been transforming itself from a food delivery service to a company that builds robot-operated food depots for customers including Kroger of the US and Casino in France — said on Wednesday morning that a fire it reported the previous afternoon as having “affected a proportion” of its mechanical handling equipment was now “not as contained as we believed.” 
The group also warned of a “reduction in sales growth” because of the fire at the Andover site and said it would need to “assess the damage” before restarting operations there. 
Shares in the FTSE 100 member dropped around 6 per cent in London trading on Wednesday after the announcement. 
Not only had the roof collapsed at the automated warehouse, where hundreds of robots whizz around on rails to pick groceries out of boxes and pack them for Ocado’s customers. There had also been “sustained damage to the majority of the building and its contents.”
The Andover warehouse fulfils around 10 per cent of Ocado’s orders. Because of the fire “there will be a constraint on our ability to meet our growing customer demand,” Ocado explained. Ocado said it had been informed by the Fire Brigade that the incident was now “under control”. 
“Ocado has comprehensive insurance for the property, stock and equipment on site, and for business interruption losses,” the group added. 
James Lockyer, Peel Hunt analyst, said that “given the damage has been worse than first reported . . . this is likely to have a substantial impact on its Ocado.com customer experience and, whilst it is covered by insurance, could do lasting damage over at least the next 12 months”. 
On its Twitter feed, Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service said more than 200 firefighters had been tackling the blaze overnight and had also warned people living near the Andover warehouse to keep their windows and doors closed to protect themselves from the smoke.

The UK-listed and Irish based company issued options for 10m shares to Mr O’Leary at a strike price of €11.12, which he can buy should he increase the company’s profitability to €2bn and/or its share price to €21 over the next five years.
The difference between 10m shares at €21 each and the same number at €11.12, their closing price on Friday, is €99m. 
If Mr O’Leary increases profitability but the share price does not hit €21, his bonus would be smaller. 
Alan MacDougall, managing director of Pirc, which works with the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum that holds about 1 per cent of Ryanair stock, said: “I would have thought he would be a bit sheepish accepting that, given the current state of the company. But I don't think pay matters much to him — it's more about power.” 
Ryanair’s 11 non-executive directors have received options of 50,000 shares each under the same terms, meaning their bonus could be as much as €500,000. 
Ryanair, which announced a third-quarter loss of €22m on Monday, reaffirmed its warning that full-year profit would be in the range of €1.0bn-€1.1bn. 
The range had been €1.25bn-€1.35bn before two profit warnings in the past four months, but Mr O’Leary said a fall in ticket prices, as well as the cost of staff strikes and the high price of oil, had hurt the airline. 
Royal London Asset Management, another large Ryanair shareholder, has said it does not consider the remuneration committee to be “wholly independent”, since it includes a former executive, “which is contrary to best practice”. 
On the day of the results Mr O’Leary announced he would remain at the top of Ryanair for another five years, but would step down as chief executive of the airline itself as the company overhauled its structure. 
The airline said it would move in the next year “to a group structure not dissimilar to that of IAG”, owner of British Airways and Iberia, with a small senior management team overseeing Ryanair, Laudamotion, based in Austria, Ryanair Sun, in Poland, and Ryanair UK. 
Mr O’Leary will be chief executive of Ryanair Holdings until at least 2024 and the Ryanair airline itself will appoint a new chief executive later this year. 
In his new role, Mr O’Leary will still be responsible for some of the most important decisions affecting Ryanair, including merger and acquisition opportunities, reducing costs and acquiring aircraft.
Ryanair could not be reached for comment."
61,"Stocks just had their best January in 32 years, but technical analyst warns about these two factors","After the worst December in 87 years, stocks just had their best January in 32 years, but one technical analyst is worried about a possible slowdown in small caps and a surge in gold.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/01/stocks-have-best-start-in-30-years-but-beware-2-factors-says-technician.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-01T12:24:00Z,"It seems that December and its dramatic drop for stocks it was the S&amp;P's worst December since 1931 is firmly in the rear-view mirror.
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
The S&amp;P just posted its best January since 1987. While the market's whipsaws may leave some investors exhausted and wanting to stick to the sidelines, one market watcher says there's more upside ahead and now's the time to buy.
""A lot of what happened in the fourth quarter of last year was just massive fear, and so we've seen that sort of being flushed slowly out of the market. So far this recovery makes sense to us and we do see potential for further appreciation,"" S&amp;P Global's Erin Gibbs said Thursday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""
The S&amp;P rose nearly 8 percent in January, lifted by better-than-expected earnings and a dovish tone from Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell.
Gibbs believes investors once again have an appetite for stocks, but she's not predicting an outsized gain for the year.
""Certainly not what we may have seen in the past couple of years,"" she said, referring to her expectations for the S&amp;P this year. ""Even when you've got mid-single digits on both your top and bottom lines it tends to be a nice, healthy year, and so we see this as continuing.""
Instinet's Frank Cappelleri, on the other hand, is more skeptical. He believes two key factors could spell trouble ahead: a slowdown in small caps and a surge in gold.
The S&amp;P 600, which tracks small-cap U.S. companies, outperformed the S&amp;P 500 last month, but Cappelleri points out that this isn't the whole story. The small caps' advance/decline line is still 18 percent from its recent high level, compared with 9 percent for the S&amp;P 500.
The advance/decline line can be useful as a technical indicator, since it can show if a market's overall breadth is positive or negative. In this instance, Cappelleri uses it to show that while the more speculative small-cap index is outpacing its larger counterpart for the year, its rally since its lows hasn't been as strong.
Buying in small caps can indicate that investors have a higher tolerance for risk, so a slowdown in overall performance could mean investors might be looking to rotate out of stocks and into ""safer"" trades.
Along that line, Cappelleri suggests that gold's move higher could be another warning sign for stocks.
""Since August of last year, it has really been the most persistent asset class out there,"" said Cappelleri. ""Think about what's happened during that time. Gold started rallying before the market crash, during, and now after. It really hasn't lost a step. So it's kind of something we haven't seen in a long time, when you have both equities and gold going up together.""
The commodity, often considered a safety trade, surged to its highest level since April during Thursday's trading session. It closed out January with a 3 percent gain and its fourth-straight positive month.
""Could be an isolated event, could mean something more,"" Cappelleri said of the asset classes moving in lockstep, adding that it's something to ""focus on"" going forward."
62,Better-Than-Feared Rally Has Some Scratching Heads: Taking Stock,"The Super Bowl and the Lunar New Year (China, Taiwan, South Korea and Vietnam closed to commemorate the Year of the Pig) are tag-teaming equity markets to suppress any real early action this morning, with S&P futures effectively unchanged, a situation that it…",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-04/better-than-feared-rally-has-some-scratching-heads-taking-stock,"{'id': 'bloomberg', 'name': 'Bloomberg'}",2019-02-04T12:20:01Z,"Crude is the notable actor early, with European majors (Shell, BP) accounting for much of the gains in the FTSE 100. 
The Super Bowl and the Lunar New Year (China, Taiwan, South Korea and Vietnam closed to commemorate the Year of the Pig) are tag-teaming equity markets to suppress any real early action this morning, with S&amp;P futures effectively unchanged, a situation that it feels like has been the case for the better part of a week or two.
It was understandable last week when one would be justified in laying off risk until major catalysts were fully digested, but this week should shape up to be notably less volatile on that front. Crude is the notable actor early, with European majors (Shell, BP) accounting for much of the gains in the FTSE 100. WTI is holding above $55, which may help the U.S. energy names that led the S&amp;P Friday.
But earnings are still in focus for the week, with Alphabet the first major report on the docket after the close today. We’ll see if their results too, can come in ""better than feared,"" to help recover some of the losses seen in late 2018. Though a player in the cloud segment like AMZN and MSFT, advertising is still king, and analysts are looking at Facebook’s better-than-expected result last week as a positive read through for the search engine.
BTF
About half of the S&amp;P 500 has reported results for the season, and there’s a little bit for the bulls and the bears to take home, whether you’re in the ""
better than feared"" camp, or just looking at the magnitude of the beats. Sixty percent of companies have beat on the top line, while nearly 3/4 have beat on earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The aggregate sales surprise is less than 1%, and while many companies are beating estimates, allaying worst case scenarios (though estimates have come in markedly over the past few weeks), less than 1% can’t be inspiring.
Defensive sectors take back seat in 2019
Deutsche Bank strategists say earnings have ""disappointed significantly so far with the lowest beats in 7 years,"" but with that in mind, the S&amp;P is up 8% for January with the most defensive of names lagging. Some analysts have called some of the volatility we’ve seen post earnings (like GE last week) ""head scratching."" And Citi analysts led by Tobias Levkovich write that they still see a preference from investors for growth instead of value. Its hard to argue with that preference after the payrolls figure Friday appeared to hit the sweet spot (allaying growth slowdown fears while keeping inflation (and the Fed) at bay). The next question will be whether the 10-year yield continues its rally after Friday’s gains were some of the largest in nearly a month, potentially adding pressure to stocks.

Internet services names ANGI, MTCH, IAC, GRPN, SFLY, YELP and GRPN got initiated at Goldman Sachs, which is bullish on names with runway for growth, potential market leadership and those with ""reasonable"" valuations. Goldman is now buy rated on ANGI, YELP, neutral rated on IAC, GRPN, and adopts a sell rating for MTCH, SFLY.
Analysts see MTCH’s valuation as ""high"" when compared to its growth, with an expectation for net adds at Tinder to slow (shares indicated down pre-market). SFLY is now sell rated due to the now ""high market expectations"" for the name; Goldman sees the risk-reward as ""unfavorable.""
Buy-rated ANGI should benefit from new demand from millennial home buyers and a shift toward online home services lead generation from offline. YELP’s new products like Nowait, Request a Quote may ""unlock"" the value from reviews and traffic.

63,India takes aim at popular Chinese social media apps,Bid to make platforms take responsibility for all content posted to their sites,https://www.ft.com/content/eb58dd30-23ea-11e9-b329-c7e6ceb5ffdf,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-04T04:00:25Z,"The Indian government is targeting the Chinese social media apps that have become hugely popular with draft regulations designed to force them to moderate content. 
Until now, Indian officials have primarily focused on regulating US technology giants such as Amazon and Facebook as they enter the Indian market, in an effort to help the country’s own start-ups. 
But the meteoric popularity of Chinese apps has now ruffled feathers. 
In 2018, Chinese apps including short video apps TikTok, Like and Helo took over the Android app store in India, with five out of the top 10 apps being Chinese-owned, compared to two in 2017. 
TikTok, a social video app, has 39 per cent of its users in India, making the country its biggest foreign market. Like, which was the third-most downloaded app in India, counts 64 per cent of its users as Indian.
The Indian Ministry of electronics and IT has proposed rules for “intermediary” apps, those that rely on users to create their content. The rules require any that have more than 5m users need to set up a local office and have a senior executive in India who can be held responsible for any legal issues. 
The draft law also calls for apps to deploy “automated tools . . . for proactively identifying and removing or disabling public access to unlawful information or content.” 
“When the potential is there for misuse, it would be naive to imagine [these apps] can’t be misused,” said S Gopalakrishnan, a senior official at the electronics ministry. 
“What prompted our proposals is the problem with risky and criminal content. The things that worry us are who takes responsibility for the content? Who moderates it? Do we want those apps to be a vehicle for terrorism or pornography? No.” 
Last July, Indonesia banned TikTok for containing “pornography, inappropriate content and blasphemy”. 
“The spread of fake news, this is happening on these platforms and it is a matter of concern and I will be looking into it,” said Rakesh Maheshwari, an official at the IT Ministry in charge of cyber law and cyber security. “Also, if there is any security malware or snooping, then definitely that is an issue of concern to us and we will be taking action.”
The Indian ministry has held talks with ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok, to discuss moderation and the Chinese company is expected to shortly publish its own response to the draft rules. It did not respond to a request for comment. 
The proposed Indian laws are similar to newly introduced guidelines in China, where short video apps such as TikTok are expected to review every piece of content that goes online and be held responsible for any “harmful” content posted by their users.
There are also plans to force Chinese apps to store their data on Indian citizens within the country, rather than routing it back to China. 
Similar rules are also being discussed for foreign payment and e-commerce providers. “In my view, unless we are very sure there is no security threat from Chinese apps, we shouldn’t allow them to operate at all,” said Ashwani Mahajan, national co-convener of Swadeshi Jagaran Manch, the economic lobbying wing of far-right political organisation Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. “In fact, in days to come, the government is contemplating strict rules on Chinese social media apps too.” 
As Chinese apps face increasing regulation at home, many have turned to India for growth. “India is the final frontier for them, because they haven’t been allowed widespread growth and access in other markets, but they are really getting it right here,” said Ananth Padmanabhan, tech policy expert at the Centre for Policy Research based in New Delhi. 
“Chinese apps can really give incumbents a run for their money, so Indian players are trying to use the regulatory route to beat them,” he added. Local apps such as ShareChat have both increased lobbying and launched legal action to defend their turf. 
Lobbyists like Mr Mahajan are also concerned that Chinese companies flush with cash will hurt the Indian start-up ecosystem. “We have seen how companies like Amazon and Walmart burn cash and kill our smaller e-commerce businesses, we need to be cautious about them,” Mr Mahajan said. “It’s been about six months since the government has started studying [Chinese social media apps], and debating what rules and regulations they can make.”"

65,Investors push for access to dual-listed shares after hard Brexit,European funds want to retain ability to trade London shares of Shell and Unilever,https://www.ft.com/content/3c19e572-256f-11e9-b329-c7e6ceb5ffdf,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-04T04:00:25Z,"European investors are urging regulators to protect their ability to buy the London-listed shares of several major companies, including Royal Dutch Shell, Unilever and Ryanair, should the UK leave the EU abruptly at the end of next month.
The concern of asset managers is focused on the dozens of companies whose shares trade both in London, which is typically a bigger and more liquid market, and at another stock exchange elsewhere in the EU. 
Britain’s departure from the EU on March 29 without a deal would mean European fund managers could no longer buy and sell the London-traded shares of companies with dual listings. It has left institutional investors lobbying the European Securities and Markets Authority, a Paris-based regulator, to find a way to give share trading in London an “equivalent” status to that in the rest of the EU.
The tussle is the latest flashpoint for investors over Brexit, which has dominated UK markets since the 2016 referendum. Investors’ anxiety over dual listings has intensified given the near paralysis in parliament has kept alive the possibility of the UK leaving the EU without a deal.
“There is a fair amount of industry engagement regarding this topic with more to come in the next few weeks,” said Monica Gogna, a partner with the law firm Dechert, which represents asset managers.
Esma is under political pressure from within the EU to resist granting London-listed shares equal billing in the event of a hard Brexit, according to two people involved in the discussions. In a statement, Esma said that it was “aware of this issue in relation to the trading obligation for shares and are currently looking into it”.
About 90 companies could potentially be ensnared by the problem, with the majority of those having shares that trade both in London and Dublin. Some Amsterdam-listed companies are also affected. The London Stock Exchange has said that EU investors would be forced to use the local listings to buy and sell such shares even if “liquidity is thin and the price is less favourable”.
Shell, Unilever and Ryanair declined to comment.
The picture is further complicated because any restrictions on the ability of EU-based investors to access the London listings could put them in breach of Mifid II regulations that require them to secure the best price for their transactions. The London-listed shares are often the more active and liquid markets.
In a no-deal scenario, the LSE said that EU fund managers would still be able to access stocks that were only listed in London.
Some lawyers worry the dispute may lead some of the companies at risk to scrap their listing outside London, where UK authorities may also be more flexible in implementing some Mifid II requirements. The UK Financial Conduct Authority, which is not party to the discussions, declined to comment.

The U.S. and China moved closer to settling their trade dispute. The next step: President Trump expects to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month to resolve the conflict that has rattled the global economy.  I think we can do it by March 1. Can you get it down on paper by March 1? I dont know, Mr. Trump said.
U.S. and Chinese negotiators made progress in two days of intense talks this week. China's Vice Premier Liu He delivered a package of modest concessions, including more Chinese purchases of U.S. farm and energy products and promises to invite more U.S. capital into the manufacturing and financial-services sectors. But the offer falls short of what Washington has been seeking and the two sides are still far from a deal, Lingling Wei, Bob Davis and Michael C. Bender report.
NEVER LET A SERIOUS CRISIS GO TO WASTE
President Trump still has the upper hand in trade talks. The question is whether he will use itor settle for a face-saving deal to boost markets and shore up his rural constituency. The initial signals arent encouraging, Nathaniel Taplin writes.
The main takeaway from Thursdays meeting: China will buy five million tons of soybeans. China bought nearly 32 million tons in 2017, before trade tensions escalated. If the final result is U.S. tariffs disappearing and Chinese commodity purchases simply rising back to where they were beforealong with a few more highly circumscribed new openings for U.S. companiesit will be difficult to say what all this disruption was for. 
WHAT TO WATCH TODAY
U.S. nonfarm payrolls for January are expected to increase by 170,000 from the prior month, a marked slowdown from December's 312,000 gain. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.9%. (8:30 a.m. ET)

TOP STORIES
RUN THE WORLD (GIRLS)
Heres an interesting subplot for Fridays jobs report. The share of prime-age Americans either working or looking for work matched an eight-and-a-half year high in December. The big driver: young women. This chart looks like a lot of spaghetti until late 2016, when women ages 25 to 34 start to break away.
Why young women? Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics, thinks it's partly because they are having kids later or not at all. The general fertility rate hit a historical low in 2017, and the decline has been especially sharp for 25-to-29-year-olds.
That means young women are less likely to stay home with children and more likely to jump into the labor pool. The trend is especially apparent over the long term.
That's a nice boost to the labor force in the short run. In the long run? ""The good news on participation is coming at the cost of slower population growth, which will become a drag on the economys potential growth rate,"" Mr. Pearce says.
FEEL THE NOISE
The partial government shutdown may distort January's jobs report. Furloughed federal employees will be counted on payrolls, but additional public-sector hiring was likely limited during the month. And there may be a knock-on effect through the private sector. Last year, private employers added an average of 213,700 jobs each month. If the private figure is close to average, that would be a sign most businesses shrugged off the shutdown. A figure below 100,000 could point to more significant negative effects, Eric Morath writes.
PAY DAY
Something else to watch: wages. The monthly jobs report tracks average hourly earnings for private-sector workers. They've risen better than 3% for three straight monthsthe first time that's happened since the recession ended. A separate, broader measure of compensation out Thursday confirms steady pay gains: The employment-cost index for the fourth quarter showed wages and salaries for all civilian workers jumped 3.1% from a year earlier, the biggest increase since 2008.
MARKETS LOVE THE ECONOMY
Banks and smaller companies propelled stocks to their best January in 30 years, a sign that investors are favoring sectors tied to the U.S. economy. Those groups were among the biggest laggards during the fourth quarters steep slide. Their reversal suggests that investors who were bracing for a sharp U.S. slowdown have been soothed by cautious comments from the Federal Reserve, signs of strength in the labor market and data pointing to tepid inflation, Amrith Ramkumar reports.
ADVANTAGE: U.S.A.
Chinas manufacturing sector contracted at the start of 2019, with a private gauge falling to its lowest level in nearly three years. The Caixin China manufacturing purchasing managers index has now stayed below 50, the mark that separates expansion from contraction, for two straight months. Surveys of manufacturers across the eurozone also pointed to fresh areas of weakness. U.S. manufacturing gauges, out Friday, are expected to remain well into positive territory.

Morgan says.",http://fortune.com/2019/02/04/apple-netflix-acquisition/,"{'id': 'fortune', 'name': 'Fortune'}",2019-02-04T14:47:39Z,"Apple has plenty of cash to make big acquisitions. And J.P. Morgan believes it should start with Netflix.
In a note to investors on Monday, J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee said that “Netflix is the best strategic fit” for Apple to acquire, according to CNBC, which obtained a copy of the note. The analyst added that Apple should acquire a company in the entertainment market and buying a company smaller than Netflix to try and compete against the streaming market leader would be a bad idea.
“There is value to acquiring the most successful player in this space, which is hard to replicate with a smaller player in this market,” Chatterjee wrote.
The problem, however, is that Netflix won’t come cheap. Chatterjee said that Apple might be forced to pay a 20% premium to acquire Netflix, placing its purchase price at $189 billion.
Luckily for Apple (aapl), that’s a bill it could paywith cash. The company has nearly $250 billion in cash on hand and could technically write a check for Netflix (nflx). But the company has had boatloads of cash for years and has been loath to make big acquisitions. Instead, Apple has been content to buy smaller companies for feature upgrades in software.
However, with a slumping iPhone business and a Services division, which includes streaming content and apps, soaring, some industry watchers have questioned whether Apple should invest even more heavily in content. Buying Netflix would see it do just that.
In addition to acquiring Netflix, Chatterjee told investors that he believes gaming company Activision Blizzard or home speaker company Sonos could also be good buys for Apple. Both of those companies would likely sell for considerably less."

The privately held London-based currency exchange start-up plans to shut its operations in the US, and reverse plans to enter China. It has good reasons. In the US, it will return all remaining account balances to customers next week, to avoid derailing acquisition plans by Ant Financial, Alibaba’s payment affiliate. Ant’s earlier bid to buy US-based MoneyGram failed after the government blocked the deal on national security concerns. 
WorldFirst has also requested that the Chinese central bank retract its application for a Chinese payment operator licence on “commercial concerns”. That makes sense if Ant does buy it. It would no longer need a licence to operate in China as a foreign payment company if part of the biggest online group in China. 
If this deal goes through, it signals the start of Chinese fintech companies expanding internationally. By size, Chinese fintech companies already dominate the market. Of the global top 100 fintech companies last year, only 11 of them were Chinese, according to KPMG. But the first two were Chinese. 
This would indeed be a good deal for WorldFirst, with Ant said to be valuing the company at £700m. That looks pricey given WorldFirst posted revenues of £86m and a pre-tax profit of £8.5m in 2017, according to the latest set of data available. On the other hand, Ant gains access to markets outside China through WorldFirst’s user base and offices in Europe and Asia. Given that Beijing seems to be considering whether to classify Ant as a financial company, it would be smart to get the deal done before there is more local regulatory scrutiny.
Ant is the world’s most valuable privately owned company, valued at Rmb1,000bn ($148bn). Yet, they are still lossmaking. In the quarter ended September last year, Ant’s net loss was $352m. Meanwhile, WorldFirst is profitable. Those awaiting the Ant Financial IPO can take heart. At least with this deal, some cash may start trickling into Ant Financial.

div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
Amazonshares dropped sharply during its earnings call and are down just around 4 percent in pre-market trading Friday to $1,644. Some analysts did warn choppy trading could be ahead ahead due to uncertainty in India, higher investment spending, slowing growth, and a weaker outlook.
Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry was one of the few standouts, actually raising his 12-month price target to $2100. ""We continue to believe Amazon represents the best risk/reward in Internet given the relatively early-stage shift of workloads to the cloud, the transition of traditional retail online, and share gains in its advertising business, the long-term benefits of each we believe the market continues to underestimate for Amazon,"" Terry wrote.
Barclays analyst Ross Sandler lowered his price target and thought that, ""stepping back, the 20% pullback in Amazon since September 2018 (vs. -7% S&amp;P), in our view, prices in much of the concerns around growth &amp; pace of margin expansion in retail, and we would let the dust settle &amp; add on weakness.""
RBC's Mark Mahaney said in his earnings recap note, ""Amazon traded off 5% in the aftermarket because: a)it was a Modest Beat &amp; Mixed Quarter AND stock was up 14% YTD (3% yesterday), implying high expectations; b) cautious Q&amp;A commentary around impact of potential India regulations; &amp; c) commentary suggesting '19 would see step-up in investment spend...That said, we view the Amazon Long Thesis as Very Well Intact.""
Also commenting on the stock trading lower was Youssef Squali from SunTrust who said, ""We believe the stock is down after-hours on a soft 1Q19 rev/Op.

70,Walmart Accused of Racial Discrimination for Locking Up African-American Beauty Products,A Long Island store removed the glass case surrounding African-American beauty products when a customer complained to the NAACP and others.,http://fortune.com/2019/02/06/walmart-hair-products-discrimination/,"{'id': 'fortune', 'name': 'Fortune'}",2019-02-06T20:07:45Z,"Walmart stores around the country are being accused of racial discrimination for keeping African-American beauty and hair care products in a locked case, but one Long Island store removed the glass after a customer filed complaints.
In a Facebook post on January 26, Patricia Fulford asked, “Why is it that the black hair products are the only ones under lock and key” at her Riverhead, N.Y., Walmart. Most of the items in the case cost less than $5, according to Fulford’s photo.
Walmart said in a statement that the decision to lock up the items was data driven.
“Were sensitive to this situation and also understand, like other retailers, that some products such as electronics, automotive, cosmetics and other personal care products are subject to additional security,” read the statement, according to RiverheadLOCAL. “Those determinations are made on a store-by-store basis using data supporting the need for the heightened measures.”
Fulford took her complaint to Walmart, town officials, and the local National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The glass cases around the products were removed roughly a week later.
This isn’t Walmart’s first run-in with racial discrimination. Other stores around the country have faced similar complaints, with one California woman suing the retail giant over her experience last year. The woman, Essie Grundy, said she had to wait for an employee to unlock the hair product case, and then was told he would have to bring the item to the register for her.
“I felt that I was being treated as a person who might be a thief,” Grundy said in a statement, according to the New York Times."
71,Don’t let your finances default to a bad deal,"Cash savings, mortgages and pensions can all quickly become poor value for money",https://www.ft.com/content/c56c7de6-2572-11e9-b329-c7e6ceb5ffdf,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-01T05:00:26Z,"What happens if you take the default deal in any transaction? I should say, this is not a column about Brexit. But the answer, I’m afraid, is usually that you get screwed. 
It happens with mortgages. Default to the standard variable rate and you’ll pay a good 4 per cent interest at most lenders — at a time when the best remortgaging deals are coming in at well under 2 per cent. You can even get a 10-year fix for not much more than 3 per cent with a little effort and equity. 
It happens with insurance. In FT Money last week, Paul Lewis revealed how he saved over £650 on his home insurance by shopping around — with the cheapest quote coming from his existing supplier. 
And, you won’t be surprised to hear, it happens with pensions. Hargreaves Lansdown, the biggest of the UK investment platforms, has just produced a report comparing the average returns from default pension funds to the average return from the top 10 most popular funds (as measured by the choices of the 19,000 people who have opted out of the default in the HL workplace pension). 
The results will make nervous reading for those running defaults: the actively made choices outperformed the defaults by an average of 4.08 per cent over the past five years. There’s only a couple of percentage points in it and stop with the nit picking, you will say. But this isn’t nit picking. It matters. 
Default funds are supposed to be simple, basic and suitable for everyone. But that’s no reason for them to be systematically awful. And as all mathematically sentient readers will know, one percentage point a year fast compounds into real money. 
Hargreaves assumes that a 22-year-old starts on a salary of £30,000 and saves 8 per cent into their pension until they are 68. They pay charges of 0.75 per cent per year; make a return of 5 per cent and will have £187,000 at the end (in real terms). 
Make the return 6 per cent and they’ll have £243,000 — going on 30 per cent more. It may be that your own scheme’s default doesn’t fit into the same deeply disappointing category as most (mine does). But the lesson is simple: never assume the default is going to be the best, or even a good choice. 
Still, of all the miserable default rip-offs around, cash savings accounts look like the worst. It is not exactly a secret that the UK’s banks operate an apathy model — most people can’t drag up the admin energy to move bank accounts and so the banks can totally get away with paying little to no interest on savings. 
You can, at the moment, choose between getting an effective 0 per cent on your instant access savings account or 1.5 per cent (that sounds like not much, of course, but remember the magic of compounding) if you can find a couple of minutes to open an account with Marcus or ICICI Bank. 
If we were all on top of this stuff, the 0 per cent accounts wouldn’t exist. You might also note that this is a situation I expect to get worse rather than better for too many of us. The banks are getting the hang of data mining. If you aren’t showing up as a proactive customer who’s likely to move, you probably won’t be able to expect much in the way of interest from them in the future. 
There is one thing to be said in the defence of the cash savings industry. It is that part of the actual business model of banks is to arbitrage interest rates — to create as big as possible a gap between what they pay out in interest on the money you save and the price they charge for the money they lend. So you can’t completely blame them for the result. This is how capitalism works. If you shop around you get an OK deal. If you don’t, you don’t. 
Where I get a little crosser is the behaviour of the investment platforms towards our cash. Hargreaves Lansdown does more than just make it easy to buy and sell listed assets. The platform also manages an awful lot of cash. And it makes real money from it. Flick through the most recent interim accounts, and you’ll see £33m of revenue from cash. At the moment, that’s 14 per cent of total revenues. 
Look at the interest rates on offer at Hargreaves and you will fast see how this works. The best you can get on your Isa is 0.15 per cent and the best you can get in a Sipp is 0.35 per cent. The Bank of England’s base rate, just as a little reminder, is 0.75 per cent and CPI inflation is 2 per cent. 
Hargreaves says, absolutely correctly, that its rates are better than those of their competitors (Interactive Investor and The Share Centre pay 0 per cent); that money in Sipps and Isas usually needs to be available for trading immediately and so reflects instant access rates; and that it has a service for actual cash savers — called Active Saving. 
The top eight platforms in the UK currently hold a whopping £17bn in cash
Boring Money
This allows clients to move their money around savings accounts at a variety of banks with no extra admin. It is an excellent service. But you can’t get it for cash in a Sipp or an Isa (even if you want to hold the cash long term). And that matters too. 
Most of us think of cash holdings as part of our asset allocation — something that gives us optionality inside our portfolios. Sure, our aim is to be fully invested the majority of the time. But we also want to hold cash strategically. According to data from Boring Money, a consultancy, the top eight platforms in the UK currently hold a whopping £17bn in cash. 
Investors might perhaps have been waiting for a sign that the US is getting nervous about monetary tightening before investing. If so, now might be time. They might have been sitting out because of Brexit. Now is also perhaps time to get back in — note the yield on the UK market is now up to 4.5 per cent. 
Alternatively, they might believe that we are soon to enter a period of deflation, in which case cash might be the best thing to hold. Or they might just be long-term apathetic. Either way, my point is that cash is a perfectly valid asset class to hold and you are as entitled to receive returns on it as you are to the returns on any of your other assets. 
Imagine if your platform was withholding 75 per cent of your dividend payments. You’d be livid. For the moment, I can’t see much choice but for us Sipp and Isa savers to take the hit on our cash when we have it — and to think of this as the price of optionality. But there is one thing you can do. Write a note to your provider to hurry them along. Or maybe tweet them about this. They are all always saying how much they love feedback. Give it to them.

72,The Best Way to Lower Drug Prices: End the Medicaid Program that Blocks Discounts,The government needs the power to negotiate.,http://fortune.com/2019/02/05/the-best-way-to-lower-drug-prices-end-the-medicaid-program-that-blocks-discounts/,"{'id': 'fortune', 'name': 'Fortune'}",2019-02-05T21:13:02Z,"On January 31, the Trump Administration unveiled a long-awaited plan to outlaw controversial rebates that drugmakers pay to pharmacy benefit managers and plan sponsors that negotiate drug prices on behalf of federal programs. Those rebates are supposed to lower the prices that health plans charge their patientsand the Administration swears that the those tens in billions in cash aren’t benefiting folks who get their prescriptions filled at the corner pharmacy counters or delivered by mail. As part of the announcement, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a “Fact Sheet” that declared in Trumpian rhetoric, “This proposal has the potential to be the most sweeping change to how Americans’ drugs are priced at the pharmacy counter, ever, by delivering discounts directly to patients a the pharmacy counter, and bringing much needed transparency to a broken system.”
The system is indeed broken, but the Administration is ignoring the right prescription. The principal reason that it’s so tough to drive down drug costs is a mostly-overlooked, blatantly anticompetitive regulation that blocks private purchasers from securing the super-deep discounts they’d be garnering in an open market. The barrier is known as the “Medicaid Best Price” policy. In effect, it puts a concrete floor under prices offered to the private plans that purchase over 40% of America’s prescription drugs. The HHS release advertises itself as a daring manifesto for taming drug prices, yet makes no mention of this competition-killer. The best prescription: Let freedom ring, and scuttle Best Price.
To be fair, the Trump reforms contain, as formulated by HHS, contain valuable reforms. Today, patients covered by Medicare Part D, the program for seniors that’s provided mainly through plans administered by the PBMs, pay deductibles and co-pays based on the official “list” price for prescription drugs, which don’t include the big rebates to the PBMs and insurers. The new reform package would eliminate the rebates, and mandate that PBMs replace those rebates with discounts that they’d offer directly to their customers at their neighborhood CVS pharmacy counter, or on the Express Scripts price list. Hence, patients would pay deductibles and co-pays based on the real, net price paid by Medicare and private insurers, not on the much higher list price.
It’s not clear, however, that the new policy of requiring direct discounts to consumers will be any more effective at curbing overall drug inflation than today’s system of rebates.
Substituting discounts for rebates may amount to claiming that you get a better deal when your credit card gives you 3% off on everything you buy instead of 3% cash back on the same purchases. The principal objective should be removing any restrictions that limit the PBMs, HMOs and other purchasers’ ability to wrest the absolute best prices, however they’re packaged. And that’s where the Medicaid Best Price policy poses a roadblock that will prevent the Trump Administration from delivering on one of its most heavily touted goals.
It’s important to understand that the new rules are primarily aimed at Medicare Part D, the program that accounts for around around 30% of the $500 billion the U.S. spent on drugs in 2018. The measure wouldn’t outlaw rebates to PBMs managing private plans. It also leaves the Medicaid Best Price policy precisely in its current form. The 123 page full text of the proposed regulation states, that “the proposed rule would not alter obligations for Medicaid prescription drug rebates…including provisions related to best price.”
The new plan undermines its avowed goal of arresting drug price inflation in two ways, the first in failing to reform Best Price, and the second in risking that its new crusade, by outlawing rebates, will axe the PBMs’ strongest tool for clinching the best deals, an unintended consequence similar to the fallout from Best Price. To be sure, Medicaid is a much smaller program than Part D, accounting for 11% of all prescription drug spending. But as we’ll see, the Best Price provision effectively caps discounts not just for Medicaid, but all private providersand those HMOs, hospitals, and insurance plans comprise over two-fifths of the market, meaning that all told, Best Price handicaps the players that pay more than half of America’s yearly bill for prescription drugs.
Second, the new rules take aim at the PBMs’ policy of trading market share for deep discounts or rebates. That’s how competition is supposed to benefit consumers, whether it’s packaged goods companies offering bargains in return for extra shelf space for their detergents or chipmakers granting special breaks to reign as a PC-maker’s principal supplier. But in its proposal, HHS objects that “manufacturers pay PBMs that meet certain volume-based or market-share criteria,” adding that “the use of rebates creates a financial incentive to make formulary decisions based on rebate potential, not the quality or effectiveness of the drug.” In effect, HHS is arguing that when a PBM offers a manufacturer a 70% market share with a payer in exchange for a deep discount, the beneficiaries actually pay higher prices at the pharmacy because the PBMs favor drugs with super-high list prices, so that the net price their customers pay exceeds the pre-rebate price. According HHS, the PBMs are pocketing a big chunk of the rebates for themselves, and providing no real discounts at all to customers. The new rules call for rebates to be reclassified as illegal “kickbacks.”
The HHS view is highly questionable. The PBMs compete aggressively for market share, and the big plans should be choosing a PBM based on the net prices, or highest rebates, it can wrest from the drug companies. HHS favors discounts that are offered directly to beneficiaries at point-of-sale, but it’s unclear if the PBMs will be able to generate discounts equivalent to the rebates their now getting. That’s because the HHS seems poised to restrict their freedom to trade a top place on a big payer’s formulary for a sharp reductions in price. It’s interesting that the pharmaceutical industry is applauding the new rules.
Susan Cantrell, chief executive of Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy, the industry association that represents PBMs and other health care providers that manage medications for 270 million Americans, makes a telling point: “The Administration’s plan would take away an important lever that health plans use to negotiate rebates, and lower prices,” Cantrell told Fortune. “What would replace the rebates? The assumption seems to be that the manufacturers will automatically lower their costs to consumers.”
The damage inflicted by the Best Price rule should prove a warning to the Administration. This reporter covered how the now 28-year old regulation hobbled competition shortly after it was introduced, and does so to this day. It’s informative to understand the rule was the brainchild of Big Pharma, and was specifically designed by the industry to prevent the deep discounting that was then threatening their profitability.
In the late 1980s, the pharmaceutical industry was getting hit hard by a cast of new power players, pharmacy benefit managers. The PBMs concentrated the purchasing clout of large numbers of private health plans by negotiating prices on their behalf. Manufacturers had launched sundry competing beta blockers, ace inhibitors and other therapies that though patented and based on slightly different chemistry, produced identical results in treating patients. The PBMs capitalized on this multiplication of competing therapies by driving deep discounts. For example, a PBM could get a manufacturer to slice 50% from the list price of its beta blocker (a therapy that lessens stress on the heart) by granting the drug leading place on its plans’ formularies, and steering the vast bulk of its patients’ purchases to that top choice. It was a classic game of handing a producer the lion’s share of the market in exchange for a steep cut in price.
That trend caused widespread alarm in Big Pharma. Around 1990, a industry legendF. Roy Vagelos, CEO of Merckfound what was from his industry’s viewpoint a diabolically clever solution. He proposed that drugmakers grant a large fixed discount to the behemoth that was for many their largest customer, Medicaid. As part of the deal, if a manufacturer offered a deeper reduction than the Medicaid rebate to any private HMO or health plan, it was obligated to provide that super-low price to Medicaid as well. The offer sounded great to lawmakers. Why shouldn’t our government, their biggest customer, get the best deal from Big Pharma?
In 1990, Congress adopted Big Pharma’s prize proposal, what’s now known as the Medicaid “Best Price” policy. In its first phase, Best Price granted a 12.5% flat rebate on the vast bulk of prescription drugs covered by Medicaid. In exchange, Medicaid agreed to offer all of each participating manufacturers’ therapies to enrollees. That meant sacrificing its ability to secure even sharper discounts by directing extra business to bargain-priced drugs. It did require higher copays for pricey therapies when a similar substitute was available at a lower price. Still, Medicaid–the program that provides healthcare to over 70 million low-income and disabled Americansprovides heavy subsidies even for the priciest pharmaceuticals. It current role as a store that provides shelf space for Big Pharma’s every offering is the price it pays for across-the-board discount first proposed by Vagelos.
Shortly after the legislation was enacted, Vagelos boasted publicly that he’d found, and sold, the fix for stopping the deep discounts to private plans that were threatening Big Pharma. The bragging was a rare misstep by Vagelos, and made the PBM managers furiousbut he’d scored an historic success in handcuffing the buyers poised hammer prices for years to come.
The minimum rebate rose to 15.1% in 1995, then jumped again 23.1% when the 2009 Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid coverage to an additional 16 million enrollees. Drug manufacturers serving Medicaid sign national agreements with HHS to provide the minimum rebate to all Medicaid plans, in all 50 states. The major manufacturers have to participate; unless it agrees to the Best Price provision, a drugmaker is banned from selling to Medicare, the VA, or any other government purchaser. (Medicare and other federal health systems are excluded from the best price guarantee. They can negotiate lower prices than Medicaid rates for the same drugs without forcing manufacturers to offer those super-bargains to Medicaid.)
The burden falls on private payers. But if a Merck or Pfizer offers a PBM, HMO or insurer a discount greater than 23.1%, it’s legally obligated to match that rebate for Medicaid. That requirement has effectively frozen reductions-from-list for the private plans that account for 43% of America’s spending on drugs at the Medicaid floor. Here’s how the math works against for Big Pharma, and versus consumers. For virtually every drug, sales to Medicaid are multiples of revenues from even the biggest health plans. Say a manufacturer offers a drug that at full list price would bring $200 million a year from Medicaid. Of course, Medicaid actually pays $155.3 million thanks to the 23.1% discount. Now imagine that the drugmaker’s biggest private customer, a PBM that provides 25% of Medicaid’s volumes, offered to increase its sales by 70% in exchange for a 40% discount. (It’s already discounting 23.1% in line with Medicaid, so its sales to the private plan are $39 million.)
That would be great for the PBM’s customers. They’d get an additional 26.9% reduction in price, and the manufacturer would raise its revenues from the therapy by $12 million or 31%, to $51 million, $30 million from the previous volumes at the lower price, plus an extra $21 million from the 70% increase in units.
It won’t happen. The drugmaker would be forced to hand the same 50% rebate to Medicaid, lowering its sales by $55.3 million to $100 million. That’s more than four times the increase in revenues from the private customer. Put simply, because Medicaid is a Big Gorilla, a far bigger force than any private customer, Big Pharma takes a hit by offering PBMs, insurers or HMOs anything exceeding the Medicaid minimum. “The Medicaid best price policy can set a floor under the price,” says Cantrell. “That’s one of the problems with achieving lower drug costs. Blaming the problem on rebates is keeping us from finding market-based solutions.”
What really matters isn’t the size of the rebate, or the list price, but where prices would settle in the absence of such artificial barriers such as Medicaid Best Price. Medicaid’s getting far from a great deal, in part because Big Pharma can artificially set list prices, and keeps raising them so that discounted rates simply rise in lock-step: In the past six years, Medicaid’s total bill for pharmaceuticals has doubled to an estimated $41 billion for 2019.
So would those deals be even better, a lot better, if prices for private plans weren’t dictated by what are essentially federal price controls, and if Medicaid wasn’t barred by Best Price from establishing formularies that could drive discounts well below the Best Price minimum? The answer can’t be provided by what-if models run by Congressional Committees, industry groups or Big Pharma itself. If the Administration is as daring as it thinks it is, it will embrace the right RX that unshackles America’s big buyers, and entrusts the cure to a newly-vibrant marketplace."

It is bad enough that the US insists on retaining the de facto power to appoint the president of the bank, as if by birthright — the counterpart of the duopoly that allows European governments to select the head of the International Monetary Fund. It is even worse if the White House shows its contempt for the institution by nominating a president who falls well short of the outlook, judgment and experience that the role demands.
Nominating a candidate of sufficient stature can at least damp the legitimate complaints from other countries about the duopoly. Across the road from the World Bank at the IMF, for example, few would doubt that the leadership of Christine Lagarde as managing director has been a success, whatever role her French nationality played in her initial appointment.
From Robert McNamara — the World Bank president from 1968-1981 — onwards the US has generally nominated candidates with leadership experience as well as intellectual and often political heft. The last time it appointed an ideologue — George W Bush’s misguided choice of former deputy defence secretary Paul Wolfowitz — it ended in disaster. The current president, Jim Yong Kim, has too little management expertise and too narrow a field of specialism to have been very effective as the bank’s president, but he has been mainly ineffectual rather than actively damaging.
Mr Malpass has the potential to be considerably worse. His judgment even on economics, his supposed speciality, is wanting. Notoriously, as then chief economist at Bear Stearns, Mr Malpass was blithely confident about the strength of the US economy in 2007 — a year before the global financial crisis hit and his own employer went under. As early as 2011 he suggested tightening monetary policy and driving up the dollar, a hard-money philosophy entirely at odds with the reality that the Fed had averted economic disaster.
Mr Malpass is also deeply sceptical of multilateral institutions. An unpopular president leading a dysfunctional organisation will encourage activity to shift to other development banks, including the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Although dominated by China, the AIIB has many European member governments, though the US has mulishly refused to join. If it is to survive, the World Bank needs to work alongside institutions such as the AIIB, not regard them perforce as threats to US dominance.
With an increasing number of rival sources of development finance — not to mention private capital — the bank needs to think hard about where it can best add value. One of the obvious areas, which it is aware of, is providing global public goods such as managing scarce water supplies, combating pandemics and coping with the effects of climate change. But effecting this shift requires the president to be a critical friend of multilateralism who recognises that its institutions need to be adapted to a changing world, not an instinctive ideological enemy. 
Sadly, the US is likely to get its way on this appointment. Other candidates have put up a reasonably good fight during earlier appointment processes, but many governments will shy away from confronting the Trump administration. If so, the bank will face a difficult time ahead. Its other shareholder governments will need to do their utmost to stand up for the bank’s role in the multilateral system, and the survival of that system itself."

""Even with its massive customer base and dominant share of online sales, Amazon needs to spend heavily on advertising to counteract the expanding focus of traditional retailers on e-commerce,"" he said.
Much of that is going to television. According to Kantar, Amazon spent 37 percent, or $679 million, of its U.S. ad budget last year on TV ads, up from 32 percent in 2015.
That's where Amazon can reach a wider audience, even if targeting and measurement is less sophisticated than on digital channels, said Harikesh Nair, a marketing professor at Stanford University.
""TV still provides high reach, making it good for building awareness rapidly,"" Nair said.
Promoting its brand to mainstream America is important because Amazon has expanded into so many different areas, including hardware, grocery stores and entertainment. Google, Microsoft, Walmart and Hulu are all competitors and require Amazon to broaden its spending, said Carl Mela, a marketing professor at Duke University.
""To build share in these markets requires a substantial marketing investment,"" Mela said.

Tesla will buy the companys 45.9 million shares for $4.75 a share in an all-stock transaction. The deal represents a 55 percent premium over Maxwells closing stock price of $3.07 a share Friday and would value the company at around $218 million.
We are always looking for potential acquisitions that make sense for the business and support Teslas mission to accelerate the worlds transition to sustainable energy, said Tesla in a statement sent to CNBC.
Maxwell makes ultracapacitors, devices that can store and rapidly deliver surges of energy. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is a fan of the technology for electric cars. Musk has said in the past the technology could be a more likely source of a breakthrough in electric vehicle technology than batteries. Musk even once said on Twitter he had planned to conduct research on them at Stanford University.

Maxwell also has a process for making electric battery components that is significantly more efficient than those typically used in the industry. This process could significantly reduce the cost of making electric vehicles, even when compared to the best battery manufacturing methods available today, Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch said in a note sent Monday.
As TSLA works toward lowering EV prices to expand its addressable market while maintaining [gross margins], we view battery cost, weight, and performance as the key drivers, Rusch said in the note. Maxwells intellectual property  in manufacturing plus applications for its ultracapacitor technology seem likely to be integral in evolving TSLAs pack design and performance, particularly in heavier vehicles that rely on regenerative braking for system economics.

79,Does Nintendo deserve a higher valuation?,Investors debate whether the boom-and-bust video games model has changed,https://www.ft.com/content/383b29d4-27c2-11e9-88a4-c32129756dd8,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-04T04:00:25Z,"“The problem with Nintendo,” explained an institutional shareholder last Friday, “is that we’ve got a company haunted by two ghosts: their best ever console and their worst ever console.”
The comment, which refers to the 100m-unit selling Wii console and its acutely disappointing successor, the Wii-U, came during a dire trading session for the Kyoto-based games maker. This is a stock known for volatility, but it ended last week nursing a 9.2 per cent one-day bludgeoning that caught even veterans off guard. 
The wildness of Nintendo’s plunge, say analysts, is no coincidence. Nintendo’s shares and the performance of the almost two-year-old Switch console are the lead examples in a much larger investment debate over the future of console games, how they will be played and where the biggest profits will be generated. 
The traditional cycles of software and hardware profits, some argued, are being smoothed out as online gaming extends the lifespan and provides alternative revenue streams to individual titles. The models the market uses to value Nintendo and other companies in the sector should, in theory, also be changing. 
That does not automatically lead to a rosier rating. Some, including longtime industry analyst Pelham Smithers, argued that the changing models — whereby console revenues are challenged by mobile gaming, PC-based e-sports and gamers watching other gamers play on YouTube — could see the console industry’s numbers plateau in 2019 after what he called an “amazing” year of new games releases in 2018. “The real change to Nintendo’s business model is going to be 5G [mobile] and the ability to stream games,” Mr Smithers said.
As you make the shift to handheld you are looking at more volume, less competition and a much longer life cycle
Jay Defibaugh, CLSA
Console revenue models show signs of improvement. Last month, Sony revealed that it had sold, worldwide, 5.6m units of its Playstation during the 2018 holiday season alone — remarkable for a machine now entering the seventh year of its cycle. Almost more important than the installed base of 91m PS4 machines though, say Sony executives, are the 90m active monthly users of the Playstation’s online network — the customer base most open to the new streams of monetisation.
But the Nintendo plummet last week followed a slide of about 30 per cent since February 2018, which suggests either that proponents of the industry-wide “new model” theory have yet to prevail or that the current success of Nintendo’s Switch is seen as an anomaly that cannot last. A cut to a hardware sales forecast can still mangle the shares, no matter how brilliant the software performance. One of the most consistent Nintendo bulls, Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal, described this as “gross mis-pricing”, and said that “only those investors who understand how the game console cycle works understand how software sales drive profit growth”.
He is not alone in his frustration with the market. Nintendo’s plunge followed word from the company of a solid performance during the 2018 holiday season, a trio of massive hit titles, and third-quarter results that included a 36 per cent year-on-year surge in operating profits. 
Yes, for the 12 months to the end of March the company cut its forecast for sales of its Switch console from 20m to 17m, but very few analysts ever thought 20m was realistic and many now expect 17m to be comfortably beaten. Those include Nomura’s Junko Yamamura, who is forecasting full-year sales of 18.4m, retains a “buy” rating and has share price target 100 per cent higher than their Friday close.
To restore investor confidence, the Switch, the industry’s first example of a hybrid machine that can play games both through a television and as a handheld device, must comprehensively beat its immediate successor, the Wii-U, on every metric and never resemble any part of that cycle. But matching the blockbuster global success of the Wii will not be enough: hardware sales of the Wii were epic, but most people stopped buying games for it after just a few titles.
Memories of Wii’s marked boom-and-bust cycle, said Astris Advisory analyst David Gibson, is what may be spooking the market. Investors should focus, he said, on whether the Switch is quietly shedding all of Nintendo’s previous console cycles and taking on a similar profile to Sony’s PS4, where strong in-house games production drives early hardware sales, which in turn guarantee permanent support from third-party games makers.
As Mr Gibson and others said, that may take time to prove, but the signs are good. Eradicating fears of boom-bust, he said, could be helped if Nintendo launches a rumoured no-frills version of the Switch that will in effect bring down the entry price of the machine without the investor-chilling headline of a price cut.
Jay Defibaugh, an analyst at CLSA, argued that the fundamental shift of market perception may come when investors start to value and model the Switch as a handheld device — like Nintendo’s highly successful 3DS machine — rather than a fixed console. A $50 cut to the Switch’s current $300 price could drive sales for a demographic that wants it (children) via a demographic that is not comfortable paying $300 (parents). “As you make the shift to handheld you are looking at more volume, less competition and a much longer life cycle,” said Mr Defibaugh."
80,"When you're picking stocks, consider the CEOs who have learned from the best: Jim Cramer",Jim Cramer applies a football concept to the world of business to help investors pick better stocks.,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/04/cramer-when-picking-stocks-consider-ceos-who-learned-from-the-best.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-04T23:33:00Z,"There's a leadership rule in the sporting world that translates well when it comes to the stock market, and investors can use it to find winning stocks, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Monday.
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
""The coaching tree is a pretty simple concept: if you hire top assistant coaches who've learned firsthand from the most successful leaders in the game, they'll be able to take that knowledge with them,"" Cramer explained. ""We know that there are some incredible CEOs out there who, in addition to creating enormous value for their shareholders, have also trained some very impressive disciples. Inevitably, some of these disciples leave to run companies of their own.""
Eventually, that lineage can evolve into an ""executive tree,"" similar to the National Football League's famous coaching tree stemming from legendary coaches Bill Parcells and Bill Belichick, the ""Mad Money"" host explained.
""The best executive tree I can think of descends from ... Marc Benioff, the visionary founder, chairman and co-CEO of Salesforce.com,"" Cramer said. ""Benioff's got a real knack for fostering talent, ... and when his lieutenants move on to run other companies, they have a habit of delivering some incredible performance for their investors.""
Benioff, who founded Salesforce in 1999, has four main branches in his executive tree so far, Cramer said. The first is Tien Tzuo, who was Salesforce's 11th employee, its first chief marketing officer and its first chief strategy officer.
After nine years at the company, Tzuo founded his own subscription-service business, Zuora, which went public last April. Cramer has been bullish on Zuora, which helps other companies launch and manage their own subscription-based businesses, since the IPO.
""Tien Tzuo literally wrote the book on the subscription economy, called Subscribed, and the numbers here have been downright incredible. I don't want to diminish Tzuo's own accomplishments. He had a brilliant idea here. [But] what first drew my attention to it was his corporate pedigree the Benioff executive tree. It's one of the reasons I've been such a big believer in Zuora,"" Cramer said. ""I think it's got a lot more room to run.""
The second branch in Benioff's tree is Peter Gassner, the founder and CEO of Veeva Systems. Gassner used to be Salesforce's senior vice president of technology and had a hand in building the cloud company's platform.
Now, he's applying cloud tech to a whole new space with Veeva, which builds cloud-based software for the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and life sciences industries to streamline their operations and boost efficiency.
""The sustained long-term growth here has been phenomenal, [...] much like, well, Salesforce.com. Gassner's background as a Benioff acolyte was among the reasons I started recommending it ages ago,"" Cramer said. ""I'm still a believer, although with the stock making a new all-time high, sure, of course, wait for a pullback.""
Benioff's third branch is Todd McKinnon, the co-founder and CEO of identity management company Okta. He served as Salesforce's head of engineering for over five years, overseeing its growth from 2 million transactions per day to 150 million.
The growth at Okta, which doubles as a cybersecurity play thanks to its specialty in authentication, has been ""explosive,"" with the stock nearly quintupling in value since its 2017 IPO, Cramer said, adding that he would buy shares on a pullback.
McKinnon himself nodded to Benioff's influence when he came on ""Mad Money"" on Okta's 10th anniversary, telling Cramer that he ""basically learned the ropes of cloud computing from Marc and the entire team at Salesforce.""
The fourth and final branch is Twilio's Chief Operating Officer, George Hu, who was COO and chief marketing officer at Salesforce. Twilio is a cloud-based company focused on software-enabled communication that boasts clients like Uber.
""While Twilio wasn't actually founded by a Salesforce alum, he has done a terrific job as COO and it's not hard to see how his experience has helped the company advance its mission of helping other businesses connect with their customers,"" Cramer said. ""The stock has rallied more than 250 percent since George Hu joined the company in March of 2017 after leaving Salesforce. Another win for the Benioff executive tree.""
The bottom line? Sometimes, you don't have to look far from the executive tree to find stocks ripe for the picking.
""The next time you hear about the concept of the coaching tree in the NFL, remember the same rules can apply to the business world,"" Cramer concluded. ""When you're trying to pick stocks, look for networks of executives who've learned from the best, because as we see with the former disciples of a guy like Marc Benioff at Salesforce, they can give you some fabulous gains.""

Mike Mackenzie is away this week. We bring you some highlights of today’s Financial Times coverage of financial markets:
After a strong start to the year, S&amp;P 500 financial stocks have hit an air pocket as investors reassess the outlook for the sector, writes Peter Wells.
Receding concerns about a slowdown in US economic growth — or, worse still, an impending recession — and a solid showing from the major banks during reporting season underpinned a strong rally since the broader stock market bottomed just before Christmas.
That outperformance, though, has tapered off in recent weeks, resulting in the sector being overtaken by, for instance, the broader information technology sector.
So far this year, the S&amp;P 500 financials sector is up 9 per cent. It was overtaken on Monday by the S&amp;P 500 information technology index, which is now up 10.5 per cent. Save for January 10, this is now the first time in 2019 that tech stocks are outperforming financials. (Although it should be noted that the big, popular tech names in the NYSE Fang Plus index have mostly been better, if not a bit more volatile.)
Although reporting season showed things are good, they are not great. Tax cuts have already worked their way through the system and the US economic growth this year is not expected to be as brisk as 2018. The Federal Reserve’s pledge of patience towards potential future rates rises has stymied the rise in longer-dated borrowing rates, which would typically be of benefit to lenders. It is perhaps why the record highs many major financials reached about a year ago remain some way off.
For a deeper look at the numbers, read here.
Quick Hits — What’s on the markets radar
Mind the gap — The US trade deficit narrowed for the first time in six months in November, helped by a sharp drop in the gap with China. The Department of Commerce said on Wednesday that the gap between US imports and exports shrank 11.5 per cent month-over-month to $49.3bn, the smallest deficit since June and better than the $54.3bn gap the market had expected, writes Pan Kwan Yuk.
The US’s goods trade deficit with China, which has come under the microscope amid a trade spat between the world’s two largest economies, shrank more than 12 per cent to $37.8bn — a four-month low. Imports fell 2.9 per cent to $259.2bn in November from October while exports dipped 0.6 per cent to $209.9bn. More here.
Aussie dollar dips — The currency retreated sharply after the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia introduced the possibility of a rate cut. The Aussie was down 1.6 per cent at US$0.7121 after Philip Lowe's remarks, putting it on course for its biggest single-session decline since February 2018. 
“In the event of a sustained increased in the unemployment rate and a lack of further progress towards the inflation objective, lower interest rates might be appropriate at some point,” Mr Lowe said. However, he said the board did “not see a strong case” for a change in the cash rate in the near term. More here.

If guacamole is on the menu for your Super Bowl party, do yourself a favor and make it from scratch.
Making guacamole is fairly easy and, when homemade, easy to customize, so you can have it exactly the way you like it. But the primary reason that you should make your own if you can is that it's much cheaper about half the cost, in fact.
CNBC Make It crunched the numbers on the average prices for both the raw ingredients and for pre-made, refrigerated guacamole dips available at four national grocery retailers: Aldi, Target, Trader Joe's and Walmart.
The average cost of guacamole made from a basic recipe consisting of avocado, lime, white onion, jalapeno and cilantro, plus a little salt and pepper to taste is just 20 cents an ounce.
By contrast, the pre-made guacamole dips CNBC evaluated sell for an average of 40 cents per ounce."

84,Bystanders of Sears' downfall will get their day in court Monday,"Unsecured creditors are objecting to Lampert's $5.2 billion deal to buy Sears out of bankruptcy, the only deal that would stave off liquidation. They have accused Lampert of everything from ""stealing assets"" to ""years of misconduct"" that read like a ""Shakespe…",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/03/bystanders-of-sears-downfall-will-get-their-day-in-court-monday.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-03T17:04:00Z,"For more than a decade, billionaire Eddie Lampert was arguably able to run Sears like his kingdom.
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
The hedge fund titan who combined Sears and Kmart in 2005 led Sears Holdings as its chairman, CEO and largest investor. The company had public shareholders and a board of directors, but Lampert had unique discretion guiding its fate. That fate was tortured. Under his stewardship, Sears closed over 3,500 stores, slashed roughly 250,000 jobs and saw its share price fall from $193 a share in 2007 to less than a dollar.
Now, bystanders in that destruction are finally having their day in court. Sears unsecured creditors people owed money by Sears who are unprotected by collateral will head to U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in White Plains on Monday to protest Lampert and air their grievances. Unsecured creditors are objecting to Lampert's $5.2 billion deal to buy Sears out of bankruptcy through his hedge fund ESL Investments, the only deal that would stave off liquidation. In a litany of filings that piled up over the past two weeks, they have accused Lampert of everything from ""stealing assets"" to ""years of misconduct"" that reads like a ""Shakesperean tragedy.""
Lampert, who helped prop up Sears for years through investments from ESL, is Sears' largest creditor, and its most protected with collateral.
The fate of the 126-year-old chain will be decided upon by Judge Robert Drain in what is expected to be a two-day hearing on Monday, Feb. 4 and Wednesday, Feb. 6.Drain has already shown a propensity for pushing Lampert and Sears to draft a deal that would save jobs, having twice granted the parties more time in order to craft a resolution when it seemed like they had reached a breaking point.
Sears' unsecured creditors include the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the federal government oversight organization that guarantees Sears' pension, which is more than $1 billion underfunded. The group is arguing that Lampert's deal to buy Sears will undo an agreement the PBGC struck with Lampert in 2015. To help fill the pension's losses, Lampert granted the group a lien and royalty fees from some of its most valuable assets: the Kenmore, Craftsman and Diehard brands.
The PBGC is arguing that as part of Lampert's deal to buy Sears, Lampert will get back full access to Kenmore and Diehard, leaving it and its 90,000 pensioners empty-handed.
The group also includes mall-owner Simon Property Group, whose CEO David Simon told investors the company is putting Sears in its ""rear-view mirror."" The mall owner has said the ability to replace shuttered Sears stores in its malls with higher paying tenants has helped its business. It could, arguably, be in Simon's best interest for the company to go out of business entirely.
A focus for the unsecured creditor committee, which filed a roughly 100-page objection against Lampert, will be deals Lampert did under his tenure. The group argues his unique control gave Lampert ""undue influence to siphon value"" on favorable terms. The deals include Sears' spinoff of Lands' End in 2014 and transactions with Seritage Growth Properties, a real estate investment trust Lampert created through some Sears' properties a year later.
Lampert, for his part, will defend himself through his legal team, as he did with ESL's court filing on Friday. The filing accused Sears' unsecured creditors of efforts to ""poison the well"" against ESL, with ""page after page of its pleadings with smears and false narratives that are completely irrelevant"" to his proposed acquisition of Sears. Lampert has argued that all transactions done under his watch were approved the company's independent board.
ESL stressed that the offer will save 45,000 jobs and was approved by an independent restructuring committee made up of the independent members on its board, including restructuring experts like William L. Transier and Alan Carr, a former attorney at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom.
At issue on Monday will also likely be the motivations behind Lampert's efforts to save Sears. Its unsecured creditors have cast doubt in the altruism of Lampert's efforts. They say his proposed deal is ""nothing but the final fulfillment of a years long scheme to rob Sears and its creditors of assets and employees of jobs while lining Lampert's and ESL's own pockets."" They also doubt Sears' post-bankruptcy viability and its ability to avoid a second trip to bankruptcy court a fate several other retailers have recently endured. 
There is reason for concern.
Under Lampert's guidance the company hasn't turned a profit since 2010. The department store industry continues its decline: department stores accounted for 14.5 percent of all North American retail purchases in 1985 but only 4.3 percent last year, according to Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. Sears' peers, like department stores Bon-Ton and Mervyn's, have gone out of business while rivals like discount retailers Walmart and Target have poured money Sears and Kmart do not have into their businesses to be among the ones left standing. Those investments include partnerships with other retailers, acquisitions and investments in delivery and online technology.
While this past holiday season was a strong one for the industry as a whole, Sears in December, the most crucial month for a retailer, posted of a loss of $193 million.
People familiar with Lampert's thinking say he continues to believe in the value of Sears' assets, like its home services business, as a collective whole, whereby it cant take advantage of its store footprint.Its DieHard and Kenmore labels still represent value and quality to a number of shoppers that grew up with those brands.
Lampert maintains his faith in the power of his ability to convert shoppers from its loyalty program, Shop Your Way, into in-store purchases, a belief that people say drove much of his optimism in the years leading up to Sears' bankruptcy, despite its continued financial losses. ESL projects Sears will achieve positive earnings growth of $25 million in 2019.
It has said its go-forward business plan will include a continuation of a strategy the store had begun to test in the years leading up to its bankruptcy. Among the things it has tested are smaller stores focused on selling its most popular products like appliances and mattresses.
Lampert also argued in court documents this week he is putting money where his mouth his. ESL is committing more than $300 million in cash to fund the offer, including buying out other senior debt holders, and at least $193 million in credit.
""ESL therefore has much to lose if [its] go forward business plan is not successful,"" the documents stated.

Healthcare, up about ⅓ of 1 per cent, and consumer staples, up less than 0.1 per cent, were the only two S&amp;P 500 sectors to finish in the black. Energy was at the bottom of the table, down 0.8 per cent, and despite an advance for oil prices. Next worst were materials, down 0.7 per cent, and technology, down 0.6 per cent.
Government bonds were mixed. The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury was down 0.4 basis points at 2.7 per cent, while that on the policy-sensitive two-year rose 0.6 bps to 2.5263 per cent. Bond prices fall as yields rise.
The dollar gained, with the DXY index up ⅓ of 1 per cent to a two-week high of 96.384."

While lease payments are typically cheaper per month, they still add up over time. Once you pay off your auto loan, you eliminate a fixed monthly cost and won't have to worry about a car payment until you buy again. If you're still leasing, that's another check you continue to write every month.
Like going out to eat all the time, small individual payments can become huge annual costs.
If you're debating which option is best for you, take the time to deliberate and weigh the pros and cons.
And before signing up for an expensive lease, consider Orman's advice and ask yourself, ""When do you buy what you can afford versus what you need, when what you need is less than what you can afford?""

Bezos proved that Thursday when he published a post on Medium titled ""No thank you, Mr. Pecker,"" referring to David Pecker, the chairman and CEO of American Media Inc., which publishes the National Enquirer tabloid. 
In the post, Bezos claims AMI bigwigs threatened to publish intimate photos of him including a ""below the belt selfie"" unless Bezos called off a private investigation into AMI that he'd funded after the Enquirer released private texts between Bezos and his girlfriend, Lauren Sanchez.
""Of course I don't want personal photos published,"" Bezos writes on Medium, ""but I also won't participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks, and corruption. 
""I prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out."" 
AMI told CNBC in a statement that what Bezos called blackmail were ""in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him,"" but ""in light of the nature of the allegations published by Mr. Bezos, the Board has convened and determined that it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims.""
But Bezos' stance is not suprising; it's just the latest maneuver in a career characterized by bold moves, since long before he was worth $130.5 billion.

div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
The multi-million-dollar lawsuit comes as Amazon pushes aggressively into original content and studio work. The company has been signing industry giants to star in, direct and partner on projects for Amazon's Prime Video streaming service.
The lawsuit, filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York, alleges that Amazon terminated without a cause a deal with Allen to ""finance and distribute his future films and to be his 'home' for the rest of his career.""
The Guardian reported in August of last year that Amazon canceled Allen's movie ""A Rainy Day in New York,"" starring heavyweight actors like Jude Law, Selena Gomez and Timothée Chalamet. 
The lawsuit says:
Amazon Content entered into the Allen Film Agreements in an effort to build and promote Defendants' film business through a highly-publicized association with Mr. Allen. In exchange for a grant of licenses to distribute at least four motion pictures written and directed by Mr. Allen (the ""Allen Films""), Amazon Content agreed, among other things, to: (i) finance the Allen Films, (ii) make minimum guaranteed payments to Gravier totaling between $68 and $73 million, (iii) pay Gravier additional amounts based on the success of the Allen Films, and (iv) distribute the Allen Films widely.
Allen had already completed ""A Rainy Day in New York"" and spent more than $20 million to do so before Amazon cancelled the agreement, according to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit alleges:
Amazon backed out of the deals, purporting to terminate them without any legal basis for doing so, while knowing that its actions would cause substantial damage to Mr. Allen, Gravier, investors and the artists and crew involved in making the films. Amazon has tried to excuse its action by referencing a 25-year old, baseless allegation against Mr. Allen, but that allegation was already well known to Amazon (and the public) before Amazon entered into four separate deals with Mr. Allenand, in any event it does not provide a basis for Amazon to terminate the contract. There simply was no legitimate ground for Amazon to renege on its promises.
Allen and his lawyers are asking for the remainder of money promised in the agreements, amounting to several million dollars. The Wall Street Journal reports the figure totals $68 million.
Representatives for Allen and Amazon were not immediately available for comment.

91,Victoria's Secret is still trying to sell sexy. And it isn't working,"The Victoria's Secret lingerie brand, owned by L Brands, has reported negative same-store sales for the past three years now, as women steer clear of its bedazzled bras and underwear and opt for comfortable pieces in more neutral colors.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/08/victorias-secret-is-retails-latest-fallen-angel.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-08T15:13:00Z,"L Brands CEO Les Wexner and his team seem to have somewhat of a plan in place for the upcoming year to generate some excitement around the Victoria's Secret brand again, but the details remain murky.
Come this spring, Victoria's Secret will be back in the swim business, according to CFO Stuart Burgdoerfer. That's a category that cost the company $500 million in annual sales when it pulled out of in 2016. Burgdoerfer told analysts during a conference call in November that the company will also move back into some of the other businesses it's exited in the past, but hasn't yet expanded further on those plans.
Victoria's Secret is, meanwhile, saying it will focus on pushing more its best-selling merchandise, like a $20 T-shirt bra. It has a beauty business that's managed to deliver positive same-store sales growth for six quarters now. And with Pink, an off-shoot that caters to college-aged customers, it's promised to use less ""bling.""
Back on Wall Street, the future of Victoria's Secret's parent company, L Brands, is still being debated.
L Brands' stock tumbled near 60 percent in 2018, making it one of the worst performers on the S&amp;P 500. Shares were worth $100 roughly three years ago but today trade under $30. The stock is up about 3 percent so far this year, though. 
One analyst recently called it a comeback story. Wells Fargo's Ike Boruchow has deemed L Brands one of his top picks in 2019. He's hopeful the company will finally close some of its Victoria's Secret shops, as he argues there are too many, and this will help it focus on profitable assets. Victoria's Secret has already hinted that it could shut some locations. It has more than 1,100 (including Pink) in North America today.
Jefferies analyst Randal Konik, however, says the company is struggling with much ""deeper"" issues than some might realize. Similar to UBS' Sole, he says shoppers ""aren't responding"" even to deep discounts. Konik thinks L Brands' shares could still fall by more than 50 percent. He further thinks the Pink brand is ""at the precipice of a major decline.""
With roughly $3 billion in annual sales, the Pink brand could fall to $2 billion ""based on our history seeing what happens to brands that are fads,"" Konik said. Pink, which also sells athleisure gear like fleece hoodies and sports bras, was once considered the growth engine for Victoria's Secret, but momentum has since stalled.
L Brands is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 28."

Major U.S. indexes surged Wednesday after the Federal Reserve indicated it was done raising interest rates for now and rose again early Friday after a stronger-than-expected jobs report, but faded by the end of the first February trading session.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.32% this week to 25063.89, and is up 7.44% so far this year. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite closed Fridays session with similarly strong weekly performances: the former added 1.57% to end at 2706.53 while the latter gained 1.38% to finish at 7263.87.
Among individual stocks, Harley-Davidson Inc. lost 5.1% Tuesday after turning in another quarter of falling sales and lackluster profit due to declining domestic demand and tariff-related headwinds. A polar vortex brought daily life to a halt across the Midwest mid-week, and General Motors Co.s stock rose 1.6% Wednesday after dangerously cold temperatures prompted the auto-maker to temporarily cease production at 13 plants .
Here, the stocks that defined the week:
Caterpillar Inc.
Slowing global growth and declining demand in China caused Caterpillar to lower its 2019 profit projection, one of several bellwether companies to cut their guidance this past week. The heavy-equipment makers stock slid 9.1% Monday on the outlook, and after executives there said problems in its financing unit hurt profit in 2018. Among others that cut forecasts: chip maker Nvidia Corp. fell 14% Monday and pharmaceutical company Amgen Inc. lost 3.8% Wednesday. 
Vale SA
Vale on Monday said it would suspend dividend payments and share buybacks after one of its dams in Brazil collapsed late last Friday, leaving at least 115 dead and hundreds more missing and burying a nearby village under a deluge of mining waste. The worlds largest iron-ore producer vowed to donate $27,000 to each family affected by the disaster, its second lethal incident in less than four years. On Monday, Brazils top prosecutor said she would pursue criminal charges against executives at Vale and demanded inspections of similar dams in southeastern Brazil. American depositary receipts of Vale plunged 18% Monday while iron-ore prices jumped, fueling speculation of lower supply ahead.
Apple Inc.
A weak outlook, a high-profile security glitch and Apples first holiday-quarter decline in revenue and profit in over a decade weren't enough to derail the tech titans stock this past week. Apple on Monday scrambled to fix a bug in its FaceTime video-chat system that allowed callers to eavesdrop on other users. Then, after Tuesday's closing bell, Apple reported a 4.5% drop in revenue and small slip in profit while also warning that cooling demand for the iPhone and a Chinese slowdown could drag on revenue this year. Still, with most of the news priced in, investors bid up shares 6.8% Wednesday. 
McDonald's Corp.
McDonalds beat same-store sales expectations in the most recent quarter, but not because customers in the U.S. market are hungrier for Big Macs or McMuffins. The fast-food chain said Wednesday that foot traffic to restaurants is falling but that menu price increases and premium-priced, limited-time offers led to a bump in U.S. sales. The problems are particularly acute at breakfast, Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook said, a time when a quarter of McDonalds sales occur. He said the chain is trying to draw breakfast customers back by optimizing drive-through lanes and experimenting with local pricing promotions and advertising. McDonalds shares lost 0.2% Wednesday. 
Facebook Inc.
The social media giant has faced a wave of negative headlines and public outcry over its data privacy practices, but its bottom line is doing better than ever. Facebook posted record quarterly profit after markets closed Wednesday, a sign that advertisers continue to see the platform as a powerful means for reaching consumers and that users have not abandoned the site en masse as some analysts had feared. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the quarter marked a turning point for the company, and Facebook would shift its focus from security to innovation in 2019. Investors cheered the results and Facebook shares climbed 11% Thursday.
Amazon.com Inc.
Amazon extended its streak of quarters with record profit to three with a $3.03 billion showing in the final months of 2018, as operating costs fell and its traditional retail businesss low margins were offset by growth in cloud computing, advertising and the services offered to sellers on the site. However, Amazon also posted its third straight quarter of slowing growth and revenue rose just 19.7% during the period, its smallest quarterly increase since 2015. Amazon also warned that government restrictions in India and spending increases could threaten its bottom line in the year ahead, sending its stock down 5.4% Friday.
Cigna Corp.
Shares of pharmacy benefit managers, including Cigna and CVS Health Corp., shuddered Friday after the Trump Administration moved to curb billions of dollars in annual rebates that drugmakers give Medicare middlemen. The proposal by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services aims to drive down the prices of prescription drugs for consumers. If approved, the new rule stands to disrupt the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, though there is no clear timeline for its implementation. Cigna fell 2.9% Friday while CVS lost 0.5%."

94,Amazon Reportedly Reconsidering New York HQ Amid Opposition,Washington Post says retailer might opt for another location.,http://fortune.com/2019/02/08/amazon-hq2-new-york-withdrawal/,"{'id': 'fortune', 'name': 'Fortune'}",2019-02-08T17:18:38Z,"Amazon is thinking twice about its plan to locate a second headquarters in New York as local opposition to the plan grows, according to a new report from the Washington Post.
The plan, which would bring 25,000 jobs to the New York City, was initially hailed as an economic triumph, but as politicians have learned of the subsidies given to the world’s largest retailer, many have become less enamored of the proposal.
Final approval from the state on those subsidies, if it comes, is not expected until 2020.
The Post cites two anonymous sources who say Amazon has had internal discussions on whether to keep HQ2 in New York or whether to look for another location. Amazon has not yet leased or purchased any office space in the area, meaning it wouldn’t suffer any financial repercussions for changing its mind.
However, no final decisions have been made at this point, says the paper. And the leaked threat could be a tactic to put pressure on New York officials.
While the Amazon project has some very prominent objectors, including freshman U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, other states have been very welcoming to an expanded Amazon presence, including Tennessee and Virginia (which also was selected as the location for the headquarters).
It’s unclear if either of those states is being considered as a fallback location. Amazon looked closely at several major cities in its long hunt for a HQ2 location."
95,"Amazon Delivers Its Shipping Intentions to FedEx, UPS, USPS via Regulatory Filing","In a regulatory filing, Amazon added ""transportation and logistics services"" to its long list of industries, putting UPS, FedEx on notice.",http://fortune.com/2019/02/05/amazon-shipping-delivery-ups-usps-fedex/,"{'id': 'fortune', 'name': 'Fortune'}",2019-02-06T00:26:43Z,"Is there anyone who Amazon isn’t competing with?
In a recent regulatory filing, (amzn) Amazon added “transportation and logistics services” to the already long list of industries and services it views as competition. While Amazon relies on shipping partners, like USPS, UPS, and FedEx to help make deliveries, the disclosure signals that Amazon is getting serious about making its mark with its own delivery service.
“The worldwide marketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world,” Amazon said in the annual filing.
Amazon’s shipping costs were $9 billion, according to its most recent earnings report. That’s a 23% increase from the previous quarter, but shows just how much customers value Amazon Prime’s free shipping options. Amazon has already taken some steps to build a delivery infrastructure to supplement its partners. The company leased a fleet of airplanes to carry cargo, has delivery vans, and has been piloting a “Shipping With Amazon” program, which entails drivers picking up packages from third party sellers and delivering them.
There has also long been speculation about whether Amazon, one of the world’s most valuable companies, might consider a surprise acquisition of a transportation and logistics competitor. UPS CEO David Abney said last month that while Amazon is a customer, he also sees the company as a competitor.
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has always been fascinated with finding ways to revolutionize delivery. He shared his vision for drone delivery in 2013. Bezos predicted it would be a reality by the end of 2018, however the program has hit regulatory snags in the United States. Amazon made its first commercial drone delivery in Cambridge, England in December 2016. They’re also deploying delivery robots. Last month, Amazon unveiled its new Scout delivery robot, which is making test deliveries in a neighborhood in Snohomish County, Wash."
96,Mike Ashley: Inside the mind of the UK’s wiliest dealmaker,"Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing",https://www.ft.com/content/617dd940-28df-11e9-88a4-c32129756dd8,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-05T05:00:25Z,"FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email.
If you’re a Newcastle United fan, that headline isn’t news to you. But for anyone who isn’t a close watcher of the Premier League or the UK high-street, let’s introduce you to the frugal dealmaker who has spent much of the past few decades shaking up the retail landscape.
We’re of course talking about Mike Ashley. The FT’s Jonathan Eley brings you this DD post off the back of his recent article, which we recommend you check out here.
Who wants to buy a retailer? Certainly not hedge funds, many of whom are actively betting against the sector. Not private equity, which has run for the hills after an earlier round of leveraged buyouts ended badly. Not even other retailers — consolidation, a logical response to overcapacity, has been conspicuous largely by its absence. Only a true maverick would be an acquirer in this sector.
Enter Ashley, a former squash coach who started Sports Direct with a loan from his parents and built it up to a billion-pound plus company. Ashley is about as far from a traditional UK retail executive as it’s possible to get. He cares little for actual shops, as any visitor to a Sports Direct store will quickly realise. His expertise is the plumbing — sourcing, stock, warehouses and logistics.
And he is acquisitive. Over the past year, Sports Direct has bought a department store group (House of Fraser), a cycle retailer (Evans) and now (apparently) a furniture retailer, Sofa.com — all from administrators. He has been linked with the entertainment retailer HMV. He owns stakes in a smorgasbord of smaller listed retailers, including Debenhams, French Connection, Game Digital and Findel.
The collection is so eclectic that trying to identify a common thread has become a City of London pastime. There are several possibilities:
It’s job lots: buy a load of stock on the cheap, liquidate it for cash, worry about the other liabilities later;
It’s some kind of property play — although most of the stores are leaseholds, and their ownership is fragmented;
It's all motivated by an altruistic desire to “save the High Street”;
It’s defensive. Sports Direct’s stores are chaotic and its online offering is a throwback to the days of dial-up modems. Acquiring department stores gives him space, acquiring brands and supplier relationships for something to fill them with. The end result — in theory at least — is a vertically integrated destination store that competes with the internet;
There isn’t a strategy. Each deal is a discrete moneymaking opportunity. As the Foo Fighters said: “Done, I’m done, and I’m on to the next one.” (DD’s choice)
Comparisons are often drawn with Philip Green, the boss of Topshop owner Arcadia. There are some similarities beyond the rotund physiques. Both are surrounded by a tight-knit group of loyal acolytes.
Like Ashley, Sir Philip is an ace at computing what something — be it a chain of shops or a vanload of jeans — might truly be worth. But he’s also into financial engineering, and his flamboyant social life hints at a need for acceptance by the business establishment. Ashley, by contrast, is intensely private, doesn’t give a stuff what people think of him and is as likely to be seen in a curry house as a Mayfair nightclub.
Sir Philip’s Arcadia is a private company. Sports Direct should be — but isn’t. Ashley’s disdain for the norms of corporate governance often frustrates investors. Those who have stuck with the company understand that this is truly a case of backing the man and hoping his plan — whatever it might be — works.

The ‘bond king’ abdicates
Call it the Bill Gross effect.
When Gross landed at Janus Capital in 2014 after a messy split from his longtime home at Pimco, shares in the asset manager spiked 43 per cent, or $900m worth, in a day. On Monday Gross said he was retiring from Janus Henderson, the firm created after Janus merged with Henderson in 2017. Almost five years after his shock defection, Gross’s reputation has taken a big hit. The assets under management of his Janus “unconstrained” bond fund has dipped below $1bn. That share price spike was supposed to help Janus bring in billions of dollars that would ultimately never arrive. The merger between Janus and Henderson was a reaction to the declining trends in the active management industry. As Lex pointed out, the shares of Janus Henderson are off 50 per cent in the past year. Its market capitalisation today is just $4bn when Janus alone was $3bn the day Gross said he was joining.
Regardless of his present ignominy, Gross’s place in investing history is secure. Finance celebrities tend to make their legend in complicated or risky securities or deals. Gross made his name in government and investment-grade corporate bonds earning single-digit returns. But his ability to tell simple (or just weird) stories around complex happenings in geopolitics and macroeconomics made him rich and memorable.
Gross said he would now focus on charity and managing his own portfolio. The man from Orange County said on Monday: “I'm off —- leaving this port for another destination with high hopes, sunny skies, and smooth seas!”
Shen and Son fight for China’s next big thing
With SoftBank’s $100bn Vision Fund taking aim at China, Neil Shen can’t afford to miss the next big thing in one of the world’s largest technology markets. That’s why his venture fund, Sequoia China, is looking to get in on the best China deals earlier than anyone else.
Sequoia China raised an $8bn global growth fund in a matter of months last year. But Shen has also raised a $150m fund specifically to make very early calls on Chinese start-ups, either offering them seed funding or series A investments.
“We never want to miss a trend,” Shen told the FT’s Henny Sender. Here’s her story.
So far Shen has picked up on quite a few of them. Sequoia China’s success has rested on several huge consumer internet companies, notably JD.com, the ecommerce site, and Meituan Dianping, the food delivery to ticketing website. Both companies are connected with China’s largest gaming and social media group, Tencent.
But one of Shen’s biggest rivals, the SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son, also has a record for sniffing out early China deals. He was one of the earliest investors in ecommerce group Alibaba, placing what is arguably one of the world’s best performing bets on a Chinese company, or on any company for that matter.
The Vision Fund recently set up an office in China and appears to be ramping up its capabilities with sizeable investments in Chinese tech. On Friday DD broke the news that the Vision Fund is in talks over a possible $1.5bn investment in the Chinese used-car sales site Guazi.
Just as Tencent and Alibaba are engaged in fierce competition over the latest tech in China, their backers, Shen and Son, are likely to continue fighting it out for dominance.

97,Amazon makes clear it's now competing with shippers like FedEx and UPS in its annual filing,"The new language shows how Amazon's growing shipping and delivery services are no longer just a small part of its business — and that it should be considered a more serious competitor to bigger logistics partners, like FedEx and UPS.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/05/amazon-10k-adds-transportation-and-logistics-services-to-competitors.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-05T18:18:00Z,"Amazon has long downplayed its delivery ambitions, claiming its own shipping and delivery services are only intended to ""supplement"" existing partners like UPS and FedEx.
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
Now, Amazon is making it clear that it's competing with those companies, as it added ""transportation and logistics services"" to its group of competitors for the first time in its annual filing last week. Here's the section under ""Risk Factors"" of its filing (emphasis added):
""Our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, digital content and electronic devices, web and infrastructure computing services, andtransportation and logistics services, and across geographies, including cross-border competition.""
The Risk Factors statement in its September 2018 quarterly report was identical except for the bold-faced words. The company did not mention transportation and logistics services under Risk Factors in its 2017 annual report, either, although it did mention ""companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties"" under ""Competition"" in last year's report.
The new language suggests the growing importance of Amazon's growing shipping and delivery services, and that it should be considered a more serious competitor to bigger logistics players like FedEx and UPS. The change follows Amazon's disclosure to call itself a ""transportation service provider"" for the first time in 2016.
In recent years, Amazon has significantly expanded its logistics footprint. It has leased dozens of aircraft and thousands of trucks to handle parts of its massive amount of shipments. It's also delivered more packages through independent contractors and new initiatives like Amazon Flex, which depends on hourly drivers.
Last year, Amazon began testing a service called Shipping With Amazon to take over more of its package shipments. In November, CNBC reported that Amazon was offering steep discounts as much as 50 percent cheaper than those offered by UPS to court more sellers to try the service, while last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that the new shipping service had expanded beyond testing markets in London and Los Angeles.
Amazon's shipping costs jumped 23 percent last quarter, to a record $9 billion, while for the full year, it spent over $27 billion on shipping. Its cost of shipping is expected to grow even further, as Amazon continues to offer faster delivery options to a wider customer base. The U.S. Postal Service, one of Amazon's largest shipping partners, has also proposed a price hike this year for a key service used for a lot of Amazon deliveries, following President Trump's repeated taunts attacking its low rates.
FedEx claims to be less concerned about Amazon's rising competition. Last year, FedEx's CMO Rajesh Subramaniam said that Amazon's logistics should not be ""confused as competition with FedEx"" because of the company's global infrastructure and 40-year experience in the space.
UPS CEO David Abney, meanwhile, is cautiously acknowledging Amazon as a competitor. Last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Abney told Business Insider that while Amazon is a customer, he also monitors the company ""as if they were a competitor.""
Some Wall Street analysts are predicting that Amazon will double down on growing its shipping service this year. RBC Capital Market's Mark Mahaney told CNBC in November that it's ""only a matter of time"" before Amazon invests heavily in logistics to become a more direct competitor with FedEx and UPS.
""There's another investment cycle coming, and I bet you it's around shipping and them actually coming out and directly competing with FedEx and UPS,"" Mahaney said on ""Power Lunch."" ""I think it's just a matter of time before that happens and it will be an investment cycle in front of that.""
Amazon declined to comment on this story."
98,Rush to remortgage ahead of Brexit,"In a highly competitive market, UK borrowers are fixing deals for up to 10 years",https://www.ft.com/content/6ad28e72-23d6-11e9-b329-c7e6ceb5ffdf,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-01T05:01:02Z,"Remortgaging is all the rage. As the uncertainties of Brexit continue to shroud the UK’s economic outlook and to damp activity in the property market, homeowners are keener than ever to refinance their home loans.
Amid the political gridlock, banks and building societies are offering an array of strikingly competitive remortgage deals. With the base rate holding fast for now, borrowers want to lock down market-beating interest rates on their housing debt while they still can.
Remortgaging has become big business for mortgage lenders: in October it surged to £9.2bn, the highest level for nearly a decade, according to UK Finance, the representative body for lenders. 
But the remortgaging decision is not always straightforward. Borrowers can choose from myriad options, including fixed-rate deals, trackers, discounted variable rates and offset mortgages. And that is before they have considered how many years to fix for — or the value of “special offers” or “cashbacks”, reduced or waived booking fees and other charges. 
To help readers find their way through the thicket of choice, FT Money explores the central trends in the remortgage market, how they affect borrowers and what role brokers can play in the process. 
Confidence versus cost
Fixed-rate mortgages have come to dominate the market in recent years. Brokers say that when customers now approach them for a mortgage or remortgage, the classic first question “What kind of mortgage do I want?” has increasingly been supplanted by “Which fixed-rate deal do I want?” 
Offering the certainty of an agreed interest rate over two, three, five, seven or 10 years, fixed-rate deals give borrowers a measure of predictability over their finances. Economic uncertainty — and the current crop of enticing deals — are driving more people to pay for the privilege of knowing what their monthly outgoings will be over a set period. Another driving factor is the sense that interest rates may rise: the Bank of England has said a “gradual pace” of base rate rises in the medium term may be necessary, depending on the impact of Brexit. 
David Hollingworth, director at broker L&amp;C Mortgages, says variable-rate mortgages — commonly known as “trackers” — are less attractive in this environment. 
“Unless you believe that the base rate is going to drop — and you could construct an argument for that — we are still at a very low point on fixed rates, so the upsides of a variable deal are fairly limited. Therefore it’s all been about fixed rates.” 
Although average interest rates on new mortgages crept up slightly last year, competition between lenders remains intense and nearly all the major high street banks have cut rates across their fixed-rate deals since the start of this year. Those with a substantial chunk of equity in their homes who are looking to remortgage can get rates as low as 1.39 per cent for a two-year fix, or 1.85 per cent for a five-year deal.
Great lengths
Over the past decade, those borrowers who chose to roll over a succession of two-year fixes have done well, since low rates meant they could move to a similar or lower rate when their fixed rate expired. But the traditional dominance of the two-year deal is now being challenged by demand for longer-term fixes, typically of five years. 
Graham Sellar, head of business development at Santander Mortgages, says the proportion of borrowers taking out five-year fixed-rate deals (compared with two-year offers) reached a record high in January. 
“We’re now seeing over half our business coming in on five-year fixes,” he says. “It could be down to Brexit, interest rates, uncertainty in general, or the fact that five-year rates look attractive against shorter-term fixes.”
The narrowing gap between interest rates on two- and five-year fixed rates is another inducement to fix for longer. Research this week from finance website Moneyfacts found that the rate gap between the two types of fixed-rate deals had fallen to its lowest level in five years. 
Rachel Springall of Moneyfacts says: “As it stands, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate of 2.5 per cent is just 0.41 [percentage points] lower than the current average five-year deal of 2.91 per cent, so despite average rates overall rising since the record lows seen in 2017 . . . the gap is smaller.”
Lenders are responding by introducing more longer term offerings, such as unusual seven-year fixed term deals. Ten-year deals, previously an untapped curiosity, are being snapped up in greater numbers. 
Daniel Hegarty, chief executive of online mortgage broker Habito, says the number of 10-year deals the broker handled, though small, doubled between the first and second half of 2018. “We’re seeing both a move to fixed-rate deals and an elongation of the rate period.”
There are, nevertheless, a few things for borrowers to bear in mind if they decide to go for a longer fix. If you change your mind about the deal before the fix ends — or need to move home — you risk incurring a penalty for coming out of the contract, known as an early repayment charge (ERC). 
On a five-year deal, ERCs are generally structured as 5 per cent of the mortgage debt if you break the deal in the first year, 4 per cent in the second, down to 1 per cent in the fifth. However, some lenders such as Santander charge 5 per cent all the way through the term. 
Longer term deals are not without some flexibility, however. It is possible, for example, to reduce the overall size of the debt dramatically (and the interest payable) by making regular overpayments, typically up to 10 per cent of the debt every year. 
If a borrower decides to move to another property before paying off the mortgage, it may sometimes be “ported” or transferred to the new home. Mr Hollingworth, however, adds a note of caution over making any assumptions on porting, particularly for longer-term deals. “There can be complications because your affordability will be reassessed at that point. If you’re borrowing more, or your circumstances have changed, you could find it’s not as straightforward as people think,” he says.
The broker question 
When remortgaging, borrowers need to decide whether to use a mortgage broker, and if they do, what kind of broker. Borrowers are under no obligation to seek their advice and many choose to make their own decisions, or go “execution only”, in industry parlance. 
But in a complex market with multiple variants on offer, brokers can help borrowers sift rates, weigh the value of special offers and provide speedy overall calculations on monthly payments as well as costs across the term of a mortgage. 
Andrew Hagger, founder of consumer website MoneyComms, says: “I would always say to people use a broker. You’ll see the ‘best buy’ tables, but a lot of the time it will depend on the size and term of your mortgage as to which deal is best for you. Let them do the number crunching for you.” 
There are several charging models. Some brokers make their money not from the borrower but the lender, in the form of a so-called “procuration fee”. Others charge a fee to the borrower, which could be a flat fee of, say £495, as well as a procuration fee, or ask for a percentage of the total mortgage amount. 
Mr Hagger says there may be circumstances in which a fee is fully justified. “In the main you should not be paying a fee for a mainstream residential mortgage. When it comes to more specialist requirements, such as a subprime or non-vanilla mortgage, if it’s something quite complex it may be worth paying for that expertise.” 
Using a broker may also help if you find yourself nearing the limits of affordability or have other special circumstances, such as being self-employed, since less time is likely to be wasted in approaching lenders with highly conservative lending limits or which are known to recoil from borrowers disclosing anything out of the ordinary. 
Recommended
“It’s about making sure you don’t apply to a lender who is never going to accommodate you and, worse still, will take two to three weeks to tell you it’s a ‘no’,” says Ray Boulger, senior technical manager at mortgage broker John Charcol. A string of rejections can also raise questions with subsequent lenders, who may ask about previous refusals. 
One question for borrowers to a any potential broker is the extent of their coverage of the market. Some brokers offer mortgages only from a restricted range of lenders. Others will be able to consider the full range of loans on the market. 
Another is where the best rates are to be found. In the past, there was often a substantial difference between the rate available via brokers and those offered to borrowers direct, or between those offered to new customers and those staying with their lender. As competition has intensified, these gaps have narrowed or disappeared. However, marginally different rates or fee-related perks may still be offered depending on how a customer has arrived at the lender. 
Borrowers may find they get a very different reception from the big banks and smaller building societies. In tricky cases, building societies may be more willing to help, since they often retain manual underwriting processes rather than computer-driven models adopted by large high street banks. 
Aaron Strutt, product director at broker Trinity Financial, says: “Smaller building societies are happier to do more complicated things. You’ll pay more — but you might get the money.” 
Should I stay or should I go? 
Borrowers are increasingly choosing not to switch to a new lender when the time comes to remortgage, but move on to a new deal with their existing bank or building society. Known as the “product transfer” option, this part of the mortgage market has been growing rapidly in the past few years as lenders are fighting harder to hold on to their customers, not just recruit new ones. 
Last year, UK Finance published data for the first time on the size of the product transfer market, finding it amounted to business of about £38bn every three months. When figures for the last quarter of 2018 are finalised, the industry expects a total for 2018 of around £150bn — nearly twice as much as the £80bn remortgaging market, which records loans that move from lender to lender. 
Ten years ago, there was little to stop customers with maturing mortgages from simply rolling on to a lender’s standard variable rate — a much higher rate than those offered under fixed or discounted deals — at the end of their deal. Then, lenders took few steps to communicate or persuade customers to find a new deal with them; now, they contact borrowers several months before the end of the deal and explain their options. Then, Mr Sellar estimates, two-thirds of these people would have moved to a different lender; now two-thirds stay. 
Part of the allure of product transfers is that they do away with the need for paperwork, surveys and solicitors that come with moving to a new lender. Banks are also sweetening the deal by allowing their customers to switch to a new rate several months ahead of their date of maturity. 
“What the market shows is that lots of customers are choosing to stay with their existing lender either to get a better rate straightaway or to have certainty of their rate when it matures,” Mr Sellar says. Like other banks, Santander has made sure customers can take this decision online; some 60 per cent of its product transfers now take place digitally, up from 20 per cent three years ago. 
It is clear that lenders have become slick at exploiting customers’ preference for minimal hassle. But what price are they prepared to pay for that convenience? 
Mr Hegarty of Habito says: “My only hesitation with internal product transfers is that lenders will not ordinarily go through an advised process. This puts the consumer at a disadvantage as they won’t have the opportunity to talk through their situation or to compare rates across the market.” 
In the past two years, banks have taken steps to win over brokers to the product transfer market, encouraging them to include the bank’s current deals when advising a client on a remortgage (brokers will still receive a “proc fee” for this service, even if the borrower remains with the same lender). But Mr Hegarty’s point stands for those who choose to decline advice ahead of a product transfer. 
A competitive future
What developments can borrowers expect to see in the mortgage market over the next few years? Unless the fog of uncertainty over Britain’s political and economic outlook suddenly lifts, long-term fixed-rate deals are likely to remain popular as a hedge against future interest rate rises. 
But the lengthening of deals has other ramifications. Mortgage market experts are predicting that, in the absence of a surge in home purchases, the shift to five-year deals will trigger a drop in mortgage activity from 2020 onwards. Customers who would have remortgaged every two years will now be “out of the market” for more than twice as long. And while lenders will benefit from having more of their customers on longer-term deals, they will find it harder to supply themselves with new customers by prising them from the grip of other lenders. 
This means that, if banks and building societies want to sustain their current levels of business, they will need to open up new markets or types of product, or become increasingly competitive. 
Specialisation is one such avenue. Mr Boulger of John Charcol believes the need for lenders to go beyond their core markets will boost the prospects for “later life” mortgages. “It’s a small part of the market but it will become a bigger part as an increasing proportion of the mortgaged population gets older.” 
Completing a remortgage online will continue to get easier, experts predict, though the disparate systems and lack of standardised questioning among lenders remains a barrier to marketwide tech solutions. While artificial intelligence has yet to conquer the mortgage process, Mr Boulger thinks it has potential to ease the burden of red tape that sometimes dogs the remortgage process — and may ultimately have a role in offering advice. 
“A lot of people in 10 years will still welcome getting advice from a human being,” says Mr Boulger. “But I think it would be foolish to discount that artificial intelligence won’t develop sufficiently to mean some advice could be given using AI.” 
When ‘best buy’ can end up costing more
High street mortgage lenders vie with each other to offer the lowest interest rates in order to ensure their loans come near the top of the “best buy” tables produced by finance websites and comparison sites. These tables can have a disproportionate influence on the decisions made by borrowers ahead of a remortgage, particularly where they are going it alone, without the advice of a broker. 
Rates should be a key part of the decision-making process, says David Hollingworth, director at broker L&amp;C, but it is also important to look at the overall value of a product since fees and other costs can make a big difference to a deal’s overall value.
Take the example of a £150,000 repayment mortgage over 25 years, in costings calculated by L&amp;C. 
Leeds Building Society currently offers an attractively low interest rate of 1.39 per cent on its two-year fix, with a booking fee of £1,999 and a free valuation. The costs are as below: 
Monthly payment £592.18
Total over two years £14,212.32
Arrangement fee £1,999
Valuation £0
Legal work £300 (assumed cost)
Total £16,511.32
Now look at another two-year deal, this one from Platform, a broker brand of Co-operative Bank. It has a higher interest rate of 1.89 per cent over the fixed term, but charges no booking fee and throws in valuation and basic legal work plus £250 cashback.
Monthly payment £627.78
Total over two years £15,066.72
Arrangement fee £0
Valuation £0
Legal work £0
Cashback £(250)
Total £14,816.72
Over two years, therefore, the Platform loan at the higher interest rate will cost the borrower almost £1,700 less than the Leeds deal, in spite of the latter’s lower rate. 
“There is some benefit in having a lower interest rate in that the amount owed on the capital balance will be lower than at a higher rate at the end of the two years,” adds Mr Hollingworth, “but that won’t be enough to outweigh the difference.”"
99,Retailers should evolve rather than ask for government help,The tide of technological change cannot be held back,https://www.ft.com/content/e6c932f8-2ac3-11e9-9222-7024d72222bc,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-08T12:16:13Z,"UK retail is having a miserable time. Sales fell during the Christmas period, and profit margins are under pressure across the sector. Hoodie-maker Superdry this week warned of declining revenues, Tesco is cutting thousands of jobs and Debenhams is struggling to refinance its loans.
We are in the middle of the kind of paradigm shift that occurs when a new technology, concept or set of circumstances challenges a sector’s model. Canals gave way to railways and roads; email is precipitating the decline of posted mail. The last shift in retail came in the 1950s, when the advent of supermarkets made separate visits to the butcher, baker and candlestick-maker unnecessary. Self-service and consolidation brought lower costs, faster processing, greater volume and higher profits. The truly great butchers and fishmongers did not disappear, but others did.
In retailing, evolution is driven by fundamentals: what customers want to buy and how they choose to shop. Success is largely unfettered by government controls or diktats. Yet we are now hearing cries for government to help alleviate the challenges that retailers face. I believe there is a better way.
Three interconnected factors are causing turbulence in the sector. First, increased costs. Some are short-term, macroeconomic issues like the devaluation of sterling following the Brexit referendum. Others are self-inflicted: retailers such as House of Fraser, who once enjoyed windfalls from selling and leasing back their stores, are now struggling with unmanageable rent bills. 
Second, although margins are squeezed, price increases are not a realistic option. Low-cost retailers now have a strong UK foothold. There is Primark in clothing and Poundland in general retail. Discounters Aldi and Lidl have a 13 per cent share of the grocery market and are expanding rapidly. 
Finally, there is technology. Some 20 per cent of sales are now online, including 7 per cent of food retailing, and that is growing. Marks and Spencer, Tesco and Sainsbury’s are having to invest in online sales even though they yield lower margins than customers trundling trolleys around stores. High street retailers, which built their dominance on having chains of shops close to their consumers, must rebalance their portfolios. There is too much capacity when you add together shops and online. 
So, is there a role for government to help protect the 900,000 jobs the British Retail Consortium says could disappear by 2015? Some of the high street’s increased costs are due to business rates, which currently penalise physical outlets. But reforming them to tax sales instead of property would not help the likes of Next and John Lewis, which are investing heavily to build their online capability.
Instead, I believe the regeneration of the high street rests on changes that companies must deliver. Innovation will help new entrants make a mark and established retailers enhance their offerings. Companies including Appear Here, an online marketplace for renting temporary retail space, are disrupting traditional physical retail. Harvey Nichols is experimenting with chat and video services and Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, is rolling out robotics and augmented reality.
We also need greater efficiency. Dealmaking can and should play an important role, and retailers who have taken the initiative should be applauded. Tesco merged with Booker, Morrisons with McColl’s — creating more sustainable businesses. We now have Sainsbury’s prospective tie-up with Asda. 
Provided consumers still have plenty of choice, this type of move will lead to higher investment and better offerings for customers and government should not stand in the way. Doing so would be as futile as banning supermarkets would have been in the 1950s.

101,Ahrendts’ departure signals Apple retail shuffle,Deirdre O’Brien to manage 506 stores as iPhone maker contends with slowing sales,https://www.ft.com/content/0c080ffe-2a37-11e9-88a4-c32129756dd8,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-07T04:00:26Z,"Angela Ahrendts oversaw the biggest change in Apple’s retail network since Steve Jobs conceived the idea of opening its own stores almost 20 years ago. 
As head of Apple retail over the past five years, Ms Ahrendts, 58, scrapped fixed tills and handed payment terminals to its roaming blue-shirted employees. The former chief executive of Burberry, Ms Ahrendts introduced to Apple luxury fixtures such as full-sized trees in pots crafted — and patented — by Jonathan Ive’s design team. 
She opened dozens of new stores in flagship locations from Paris to Milan and took Apple to new corners of the globe, including Thailand and South Korea. 
Touting the stores as “town squares”, Ms Ahrendts launched community-oriented features such as “Today at Apple” — free sessions on how to use iPhones and Macs for photography, music and other creative applications. 
Yet by one measure, these efforts failed to repeat the radical transformation that she produced over her eight years at Burberry. Ms Ahrendts’ innovations did not ultimately increase the share of Apple’s sales that went through its own stores. 
According to Apple’s annual filings, 29 per cent of Apple sales were through “direct” channels last year, including physical and online stores, compared with 30 per cent in 2013, the year before Ms Ahrendts joined. 
While the iPhone remains Apple’s most lucrative product, accounting for almost two-thirds of revenues, mobile operators still control the majority of the product’s distribution. Ms Ahrendts told Vogue Business last month that Macs, not iPhones, are the top-selling product in retail stores. 
Deirdre O'Brien (left) is taking control of Apple’s 506 retail stores in 22 countries at a time when the iPhone maker needs them more than ever.
Now, with iPhone sales in decline as Apple still searches for a new hit product to replace it, a new executive will take charge of its retail strategy. 
On Tuesday, Apple announced that veteran executive Deirdre O’Brien would replace Ms Ahrendts as the company’s retail chief. 
Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said the changes were “bittersweet”, describing Ms Ahrendts as a “positive, transformative force”. An Apple statement said that Ms Ahrendts would be leaving in April for “new personal and professional pursuits”. 
Analysts warn that the Ms Ahrendts’ luxury details seem out of step with Apple’s broadening customer base, especially as it is forced to employ new promotional gambits to rekindle iPhone sales. 
“I think Angela did a great job in improving brand presence of the stores, growing engagement through the added knowledge the classes bring and taking easy sales from in-store to online,” said Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Creative Strategies. 
But she added that now, as the number of people who use iPhones tops 900m, Apple’s focus needs to be on “less savvy” mass market customers who “need more hand-holding” if they are to buy and utilise the latest technology.
Apple’s stores remain the envy of the rest of the high street. Its average sales per square foot have increased from $4,551 in 2014 to $5,627 last year, according to estimates by eMarketer, a research group, putting it far ahead of even luxury retailers such as Tiffany. 
“It’s very hard to wander into one of their new stores if you are at all Apple’d up and not emerge with something,” said John Ryan, managing director of New stores, a retail information service. 
In part, he put that down to high-touch details such as display tables that cost ten times as much as their equivalents at other electronics retailers. “It’s a measure of just how good they are in terms of design that other people have flocked to copy them — and I can’t think of one that is as good.”
Makers of electronics accessories such as drones, headphones and iPhone cases see winning a place on the shelves of an Apple Store as a badge of honour. 
“They sell really good amount of product and display it fantastically,” said Tom Johnstone, chief marketing officer at Ember, which makes tea and coffee cups whose temperature is controlled using a mobile app. The cups are one of a select group of third-party products sold in Apple stores.
Ember had to pass Apple’s gruelling selection process that includes assessing packaging design and build quality, as well as integrating with Apple’s software platforms. “When you talk to other retailers, being in the Apple store is a little bit like going to a top university,” Mr Johnstone said. “You don’t have to prove your worth.”
Ms O’Brien will be well aware of the value of Apple’s retail network: she helped set up some of the very first stores alongside Jobs in 2001. 
She is only the fourth person to be tasked with leading Apple’s retail strategy in 18 years. Unlike her predecessors, who were all brought in from outside the company, Ms O’Brien has spent 30 years at Apple, most recently taking charge of its human resources.

Despite her low public profile, Ms O’Brien has long been a trusted lieutenant of Mr Cook and worked in a variety of operational roles in the company, including sales and demand forecasting. 
She is taking control of Apple’s 506 retail stores in 22 countries at a time when the iPhone maker needs them more than ever. 
With iPhone sales in decline as a broader slowdown takes hold in the smartphone market, Apple stores have been offering more generous incentives for existing owners to trade in their devices for the latest model. 
Mr Cook told CNBC in an interview last month that this can help to compensate for the decline in subsidies from mobile operators, which have been phased out in recent years across the US and Europe. 
“There’s a substantial benefit, economic and environmental, from trade-in,” Mr Cook said. 
However, inviting more customers to walk through the doors of an Apple store threatens to exacerbate a growing problem for its retail arm: overcrowding and delays, especially for repairs and support at the “Genius Bar”. 
Gene Munster, a tech investor at Loup Ventures and a former equity analyst, said: “While we view Apple’s physical retail experience as the best in tech, there’s room for improvement. The Genius Bar is a victim of its own success and wait times are lengthy. The time it takes to make a purchase in-store is also too long.”
If she can overcome such challenges while preserving what has made Apple’s stores so profitable, industry insiders have speculated that Ms O’Brien could be a strong candidate to succeed Mr Cook as chief executive. 
“I don’t necessarily look at this one move as succession,” says Mr Cybart, “but it does fit with this idea that you have an operations-minded people getting more responsibility at Apple.” By contrast, he added, “people would look at Angela as being a bit more about the broader vision for retail.”"

For those who are clueless about the big game on Sunday, Amazon’s Alexa is able to help. (In case you were wondering, it’s the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams.)
There are now more than 80,000 skills in Amazon’s Alexa store, according to CEO Jeff Bezos. And thankfully, for football rookies, these will come in handy for game day:
The Rookie’s Guide to the NFL
Go straight to the source with the NFL’s Alexa skill. After enabling this skill, Alexa will be able to help explain everything you’ve ever wanted to know about the game, including rules, penalties, scoring, plays and football lingo. The NFL skill even offers a history lesson previous Super Bowls.
Tom Brady Facts
By now, rookies may have learned that Tom Brady, widely regarded as one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time, will be playing to win his sixth Super Bowl championship ring. Patriots fans may want to consult the “Tom Brady Facts” skill during the big game, so they can attempt to back up any trash talk with facts.
American Football Trivia
Learn something newor test your existing gridiron smartswith the American Football Trivia skill. And then get ready for the big game.
In addition to the ads, Amazon is teasing a new, celebrity-packed commercial this year, showing what might happen when the company puts Alexa in everyday objects. Expect a hilarious cameo from Harrison Ford, who tells his rambunctious dog to stop ordering so much foot by barking at its Alexa-enabled smart collar.
Last year, Amazon had to do some behind the scenes tinkering to make sure customers’ speakers wouldn’t go haywire when the word “Alexa” was mentioned ten times in the company’s 2018 Super Bowl ad. Let’s hope this year’s game plan is equally effective."

At the same time, the company again defended publishing Bezos’ private texts last month in an Enquirer article. The company said, it ” believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story” and was “in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters.”
Bezos hired an investigator, Gavin de Becker, to look into how the communications were obtained. The Washington Post ran a story on Tuesday about whether the initial Enquirer piece was politically motivated. Bezos owns the newspaper.
In a Thursday online post titled No thank you, Mr. Pecker, referring to American Media CEO David Pecker, Bezos wrote at length about alleged threats made by the Enquirer to publish racy photos of him and a friend, Lauren Sanchez. Bezos claims American Media demanded an end to the Post’s investigation and that he and de Becker should publicly state that “they have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that AMs coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.”"
104,WhatsApp: India’s encryption rules ‘not possible’,Plan to force tech groups to hand over private messages would require redesign of app,https://www.ft.com/content/9fcfa604-2a0d-11e9-88a4-c32129756dd8,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-06T14:37:57Z,"WhatsApp, the Facebook-owned messaging app, has said the Indian government’s proposal to force tech companies to hand over encrypted messages is “over-broad” and “not possible” ahead of the country’s national elections this spring.
Reacting to New Delhi’s draft rules that would allow authorities to trace the origins of encrypted messages, WhatsApp communications head Carl Woog said on Wednesday that the changes were “not possible today given the end-to-end encryption that we provide and it would require us to re-architect WhatsApp, leading to a different product, one that would not be fundamentally private”.
India is WhatsApp’s largest market, with more than 200m users.
The draft rules would require tech companies to monitor and hand over personal data of users and remove content deemed unlawful within 24 hours. They are part of India’s effort to curb the spread of misinformation following a series of mob lynchings by crowds of angry villagers incited by WhatsApp messages last year.
WhatsApp is united with other tech giants in opposition to the proposals. The Asia Internet Coalition, a lobby group whose members include Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, described the laws in a submission last month to the Indian government as “intrusive to an individual’s freedom of speech and expression and right to privacy”.
WhatsApp said on Wednesday that ahead of the upcoming Indian elections in April and May, it was leaning on artificial intelligence tools to detect abusive behaviour and ban suspicious accounts.
The company has already implemented new restrictions on the number of times a message can be forwarded, and is now building detection systems to identify accounts that send a high volume of messages or appear to be sending messages from an automated source. Over the past three months, WhatsApp has banned more than 2m accounts per month for bulk or automated behaviour out of its 1.5bn monthly active users worldwide, according to a company report. 
Matt Jones, a WhatsApp software engineer, emphasised that WhatsApp was not a “broadcaster”. He added: “We’re not here to give people a megaphone, we’re here for private messaging.”
However, Nikhil Narendran, partner at Trilegal, a law firm, said India was “tightening the noose around tech companies, especially the companies that operate from the outside”, and WhatsApp’s efforts to stop fake news were “unlikely” to satisfy authorities.
The company is also testing a digital payment system in India, but the launch has been delayed by regulatory hurdles, with authorities demanding that its payments data be processed in the country."

Information technology and healthcare were the best performers, up 0.4 per cent and 0.2 per cent, respectively.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite declined by 0.3 per cent to 7,377.10, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fluctuating between losses and gains was flat at 25,418.37 at pixel time.
Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive were the biggest losers in the S&amp;P 500 as the conventional video game developers delivered disappointing sales forecasts in the face of a growing threat from online and mobile games. Shares in both companies tumbled more than 13 per cent. Skyworks Solutions, a chip supplier to Apple, was the top performer, with shares jumping by 11.4 per cent.
General Motors’ shares which had jumped immediately after reporting results trimmed their gains to trade 1.5 per cent higher by midday, as the Detroit automaker reported a smaller than expected profit decline in the final quarter of last year. The company cited a “volatile” year in which it was hit by $1bn in tariff related commodity costs.
That also followed a down day in European markets, after Germany reported an unexpected fall in its industrial orders and investors digested disappointing news from companies like BNP Paribas and Daimler. 
Donald Trump’s State of the Union address failed to help spur markets. During his speech late on Tuesday, the President revealed he would have a second meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un this month. He also delivered mixed signals on national unity, with a declaration that he was sending US troops to the Mexican border to stop migrant caravans amid renewed demands for funding of a border wall.
Mr Trump’s first State of the Union to a divided Congress came days after the end of a five-week government shutdown and with a stopgap funding bill set to expire on February 15, the President called on Congress to agree on a “common sense” plan for border security that included a “new physical barrier, or wall”.
Investors also digested fresh data as a report on Wednesday showed the US trade deficit narrowed for the first time in six months in November, helped by a sharp drop in the gap with China. 
Elsewhere in markets, the yield on the US 10-year was down 0.2 basis points to 2.696 per cent, while that on the two-year was also lower by the same margin to 2.520 per cent. Yields move inversely to price.

106,Woody Allen Sues for a $68 Million Refund From Amazon Over His Missing Movie,"The director filed a lawsuit against the company for not releasing his Selena Gomez comedy 'A Rainy Day in New York,' filmed in 2017.",http://fortune.com/2019/02/07/woody-allen-sues-for-a-68-million-refund-from-amazon-over-his-missing-movie/,"{'id': 'fortune', 'name': 'Fortune'}",2019-02-07T22:34:58Z,"Woody Allen is hoping to get a prime payout from Amazon.
The 83-year-old director filed a $68 million lawsuit Thursday against the company over the release of his most recent feature film, A Rainy Day in New York, starring Selena Gomez and Timothée Chalamet. Production on the film was completed in 2017, but the movie has been sitting on the shelf, reportedly delayed by concerns over Allen’s past behavior.
According to the suit, obtained by The Hollywood Reporter, Allenthe decades-spanning director of such hits as Annie Hall and Midnight in Parissigned a series of lucrative deals with the company in 2014, just as Amazon was ramping up its slate of original productions. The multi-part agreement, valued between $68 million and $73 million, would require Allen to write and direct several film and television installments for the streamer, including the mini-series Crisis in Six Scenes, which Amazon released in 2016 to miserable reviews.
The star-studded Rainy Day, which also stars Elle Fanning and Oscar nominee Jude Law, was supposed to be Allen’s follow-up. Instead, according to the suit, its release date was initially pushed back from 2018 to this year, thanks in part to controversy surrounding Roy Price, the Amazon Studios chief who resigned in 2017 amid claims of sexual harassment.
But Allen’s own public image had also suffered potentially career-ending damage. In 2014, adoptive daughter Dylan Farrow wrote a New York Times essay accusing Allen of sexually abusing her as a minor. Two years later, Allen’s son Ronan Farrow contributed a column to The Hollywood Reporter in which he said he believed his sister’s claims. Over the next few years, as the MeToo and Time’s Up movements grew, some former collaborators began distancing themselves from Allen, including Chalamet, who last year announced he was donating his Rainy Day salary to a handful of charities. “I don’t want to profit from my work on the film,” the actor wrote in an Instagram post.
Amazon did release Allen’s drama Wonder Wheel in 2017. But the film was released with minimal fanfare in just a few hundred theatersand earned less than $2 million, making it one of the lowest-grossing movies of Allen’s careerand seemed to confirm that Allen’s private-life troubles were proving a turn-off with moviegoers.
The continuing controversy over Allen’s past apparently convinced Amazon to scrap the release of A Rainy Day in New York in any form, prompting Allen’s breach of contract lawsuit, which was filed in a New York federal court. “Amazon has tried to excuse its action by referencing a 25-year old, baseless allegation against Mr. Allen,” notes the lawsuit, which is seeking at least $68 million. “But that allegation was already well known to Amazon (and the public) before Amazon entered into four separate deals with Mr. Allenand, in any event it does not provide a basis for Amazon to terminate the contract.”
As of now, it seems likely that the release of Rainy will be held up further in the courtsthat is, if it’s ever released at all. The writer-director has averaged about one movie a year since his Annie Hall heyday in the late seventies, but hasn’t been behind the camera since 2017, making for the longest absence of his career. According to the Internet Movie Database, Allen’s next film is due in 2020, but for a filmmaker whose projects usually command big stars and big attentions, the details on his next release are notably murky. There’s no title, nor are there any confirmed cast members.
“The plot,” the site notes, “is currently unknown.”"

It's not even close literally. 
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
The No. 1 place to buy a home in the Empire State is Bethlehem, a town of roughly 35,000 in Albany County that's about three hours away from, and 150 miles north of, New York City, according to financial website GOBankingRates, which conducted a study to find ""the best place to buy a home in every state based on the quality of the area and what sort of value you can expect based on the local housing market."" 
The study used data from real-estate websites Zillow and AreaVibes and focused on five metrics: livability (measuring factors such as amenities, employment and education); median home listing price; median home value; home value forecast (gauging the ""return you can expect on your money""); and buyer-seller index (a score that determines ""whether the current market favors people looking for housing or looking to sell"" relative to other towns in the same metro).
Here's how Bethlehem ranks:
Livability score: 63
Home value forecast: 9.6 percent
Buyer-seller index: 0.27
Based on the most recent data from Zillow, here's what buyers can expect to pay:
Median listing price: $309,900
Median home value: $267,100
""Buying in Bethlehem is projected to give you one of the best one-year returns on your money at 9.6 percent,"" says GOBankingRates.
""And if you're younger and looking in the Empire State, you might need alternatives to the Big Apple, one of the worst cities for millennials looking to buy homes.""
The median listing price for a home in New York City is $829,000 and the median home value is $681,500. Meanwhile, only 5 percent of millennials looking to buy a home this year said they plan to spend $500,000 or more, according to a survey from Clever Real Estate."
108,9 Things Investors Will Be Watching Closely in Trump’s State of the Union Speech,Clues on trade policy are likely to be top of mind for stocks investors watching President Trump’s State of the Union speech Tuesday.,http://fortune.com/2019/02/04/investors-state-of-the-union/,"{'id': 'fortune', 'name': 'Fortune'}",2019-02-04T15:55:29Z,"Clues on trade policy are likely to be top of mind for stocks investors watching President Trumps State of the Union speech Tuesday. Trade remarks may influence equity sectors from footwear to auto parts, while pharma stocks may be volatile if the president zeros in on drug costs reforms, and financials and housing may be overlooked.
Trump is expected to reference a few areas where both parties can agree — including prescription drug prices and infrastructure plans — but it is difficult to imagine the rhetoric turning into reality when Washington has struggled to keep the lights on, Compass Points Isaac Boltansky tells Bloomberg. Boltansky expects the speech to focus on economic growth, immigration, a few bipartisan mirages and the wall. Still, this years speech may mean less for investors than it has in prior years, as the State of the Union has become more pomp than policy, he said.
Trump is likely to focus on his Promises Made, Promises Kept mantra to ensure that the America First base of supporters turns out again in force, Beacon Policy Advisors wrote in a note. As such, executive actions restricting immigration, lowering drug prices, implementing trade restrictions, and other foreign policy initiatives will be front and center.
Heres what to watch:
Trade
Next steps with China are the most important trade point, Height Capital Marketss Clayton Allen tells Bloomberg. He expects Trump will aggressively claim concessions from the Chinese, while discussions with the European Union are a dark horse, as everyone seems to have let this go to the back burner, but there is still a lot of potential tension. Allen also expects additional threats to pull out of Nafta in an attempt to force Congressional support for the USMCA, and aggressive rhetoric around Venezuela, but no announcement of additional actions.
Trade is likely to occupy a substantial portion of the speech, as legislative action from Congress during the next two years is unlikely, so Trump needs to prioritize areas where he can enact change unilaterally, Veda Partners director of economic policy research Henrietta Treyz says. She expects Trump to leave the door open for further tariffs … but message that progress is being made.
Its also possible Trump may focus on the USMCA in a bid to be flashy, and attract headlines that would trigger the combustible momentum youd need to get action from the House or Senate before July 2019, Treyz said. The president may also indicate his willingness to impose tariffs on foreign automobile imports in an effort to shore up the automobile industry to protect our national security.
Much like Trumps trade agenda, the speech will likely flow between the two poles that anchor the Administrations macro trade policy: Tariff Man vs. Art of the Deal, Cowens Chris Krueger wrote in a note. We will be listening closely for any discussion of the biggest trade variable: auto and auto parts tariffs.
If Trump mentions Nafta, automakers and parts suppliers will be the names to watch: General Motors, Ford, and Dorman Products, Visteon Corp., Delphi Technologies, American Axle &amp; Manufacturing, Standard Motor Products, Aptiv Plc and Cooper-Standard. Regarding relations with China, keep an eye on industrial companies Caterpillar Inc. and Boeing Co.
Commodity investors may find comments on trade talks with China of particular interest, as industrial metals, such as copper, have been whipsawed by concerns over demand from China as the trade war stings. Theyll be looking for hints ahead of Trumps March 1 hard deadline in trade negotiations, and Chinas Vice Premier Liu Hes upcoming Washington meetings.
Retail
If Trump can assure the U.S. and China are moving closer to a trade deal, apparel and footwear companies will rally as the probability of tariffs on finished goods eases, Bloomberg Intelligences Chen Grazutis said. That might also mean Chinas economy will return to faster growth, a positive for global brands that are counting on sales there.
Companies including Nike Inc., Under Armour Inc., Canada Goose Holdings, VF Corp., Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Gap Inc., Ralph Lauren Corp., and PVH Corp. are a few apparel and footwear stocks with tariff exposure or that seek to expand in China.
Infrastructure
This will be a big area to watch as Trump is said to make a renewed push for spending in the sector, widely seen as a rare spot of bipartisanship in Washington. While the topic had been sidelined amid raging debates over tax reform and immigration, many experts see a plan making some inroads this year. Stocks to watch include Eagle Materials, Martin Marietta Materials, Emerson Electric, Eaton, Masco, Vulcan Materials, as well as railroad and airline companies.
Capital Alpha Partners Byron Callan said the address is an opportunity to highlight infrastructure as something to get done in 2019 after two years of little or no progress.
Health Care
Trump is likely to tout his administrations long-awaited proposal to end a complex system of drug rebates thats been blamed for helping keep prices high. The measure, announced on Thursday, could hand the president a potential win on drug pricing if passed.
Besides directly targeting middlemen like pharmacy benefit managers, the policy is a clear negative for makers of expensive drugs that use rebates to fend off competition from cheaper alternatives, said Veda Partners analyst Spencer Perlman. Sell-side analysts at Wall Street firms had mixed reactions as health-care supply chain stocks fell on Friday.

Defense
Trumps defense spending priorities will be interesting to watch because were still really trying to gauge where he stands, James Bach, Bloomberg Intelligence government analyst said. In general, Trump has overseen some pretty significant increases in discretionary appropriations. There hasnt been a lot of noise around cutting spending as of late, so it would be notable if he does bring this up.
Stocks to watch include Lockheed Martin Corp., Raytheon Co., Northrop Grumman Corp., General Dynamics Corp. and Boeing.
Energy
Trump may flag sanctions on Venezuelas state-owned oil company PDVSA that effectively block the nation from exporting crude to the U.S. Thats left U.S.-based refiners including Valero Energy Corp. searching for alternative sources of heavy crude oil. Goldman Sachs recently noted Valero, Citgo, PBF Energy Inc. and Marathon Petroleum Corp. are the main U.S. refiners exposed to Venezuelan crude imports.
Financials
Were not expecting President Trump to really focus or provide new views for the financial sector, Bloomberg Intelligences Nathan Dean said. Trump is likely to be content to let regulators continue their path towards regional bank de-regulation.
Housing, Housing Finance
Housing probably wont be one of Trumps hottest topics during the speech, Bloomberg Intelligences Ben Elliott said. If it gets a mention, itll probably be indirect or will just be a few seconds. Even though housing finance reform and plans for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been under scrutiny lately, the president is unlikely to extensively discuss them, Elliott added.
Theres a chance Trump mentions the administrations intent to end the conservatorship of the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) but we think any comments will probably just be in passing and lack specificity about the administrations plan, KBWs Brian Gardner wrote in a note.
The Wall/Shutdown Concern
Height Capital Marketss Allen will also be watching for how much Trump emphasizes other ways to get his wall as another shutdown seems like it hinges on an emergency declaration."
109,No One Has Made More Money During Trump’s Presidency Than Jeff Bezos,"Two years into Donald Trump’s presidency, the man who has profited most from the era is his foremost nemesis in the business world.",http://fortune.com/2019/02/05/jeff-bezos-trump-amazon/,"{'id': 'fortune', 'name': 'Fortune'}",2019-02-05T16:10:56Z,"Two years into Donald Trumps presidency, the man who has profited most from the era is his foremost nemesis in the business world, Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos.
Trump has repeatedly vilified Bezos, threatening his company with tax increases, antitrust prosecution and higher shipping fees, attacking the Bezos-owned Washington Post as a scam and even mocking the billionaire for his pending divorce. Trump dubbed him Jeff Bozo. No figure in corporate America is attacked more often in Trumps Twitter posts.
Yet no one has made more money than Bezos since Trumps election. The presidents social-media huffing and puffing hasnt hurt a solidly constructed business riding the rise of electronic commerce, web advertising and cloud computing.
Since the election, Bezos has become the worlds richest person, his net worth swelling by $66.8 billion through Monday, surpassing the gains of the worlds second-fastest riser during that period, French luxury-goods tycoon Bernard Arnault, by 50 percent. Bezoss wealth was valued at $135.4 billion, making his fortune a third bigger than Bill Gatess, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
Within the U.S., the closest anyone has come to the Amazon chiefs Trump era gains is investor Warren Buffett - who added $19.2 billion over the same period. Bezoss and Amazons success has made the tycoon and his company a fixture of American society. During Sundays Super Bowl, Bezos sat with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell while Amazon aired ads for its Alexa service starring Harrison Ford. A Washington Post ad narrated by Tom Hanks celebrated American journalism with the pointed line, Knowing keeps us free.
The presidents son, Donald Trump Jr., mocked the Post ad on Twitter.
Bezoss wealth has surged since the president took office, with his net worth growing $64.1 billion since Trumps inauguration. For context, just four other people on the planet - Gates, Buffett, Arnault, and Facebooks Mark Zuckerberg - are worth more than $64 billion.
The enormous gains have been driven almost exclusively by Bezoss holdings in Amazon. Even with the companys stock dropping after lower-than-expected growth guidance, shares in Amazon rose 107 percent since Election Day as of the close of markets on Friday.
Amazon was up 0.4 percent on Monday.
Even as Amazons low-margin electronic commerce business has matured, the company added fast growing lines that are more profitable. The company dominates cloud computing, benefiting from a rapid transition among businesses toward renting computing power and data storage space rather than maintaining their own facilities. Digital advertising recently emerged as a new profit center as the tech giant leverages its deep data on consumer purchase behavior and position as the webs most prominent marketplace.
Trumps threats have so far been idle. The federal government hasnt launched any antitrust prosecution against Amazon.
The presidents agitation for the U.S. Postal Service to charge more for package delivery - based on his belief Amazon has a sweetheart deal costing the government money - led only to a Treasury Department report proposing that the post office increase rates. The report didnt provide explicit instructions on how much more the Postal Service - which maintains it doesnt lose money on Amazon deliveries - should charge.
In the meantime, Amazon is expanding its own delivery infrastructure, reducing its reliance on any provider.
If anything, Amazon may be benefiting from Trumps administration. The company is pitching its facial recognition software as a tool for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, positioning itself to reap profits from the presidents crackdown on illegal immigration.
The Trump Department of Defenses decision to give a $10 billion cloud computing to a single contractor is widely believed to advantage Amazon Web Services when the award is made later this year. Bezoss competitors including Oracle Corp have bitterly protested the Pentagons approach as unfair.
The Washington Posts investigations of Trump and his administration have captured wide attention for Bezoss newspaper. Though the closely held company doesnt disclose financial results, publisher Fred Ryan said in early 2018 the paper had turned a profit for a second straight year.
In recent weeks, Trump has seized on more personal criticism of the Amazon founder. During the government shutdown in early January, Trump seemed to revel in news that Bezos was divorcing his wife, MacKenzie, after 25 years of marriage.
Its going to be a beauty, Trump - himself familiar with messy divorce settlements — said of the news.
One consolation for Bezos: Even if his wife is awarded half of their assets - a possibility under Washington State law, which provides for property acquired during marriage to be equally divided in a divorce — the Amazon chief will still be almost as rich as he and his wife were the day Trump was elected."

DAVID FABER: Papa John's announcing a $200 million strategic investment by Starboard Value, and the addition of three directors that they say will enhance growth and value creation at the embattled pizza franchise. Here to discuss the future of Papa John's, its CEO Steve Ritchie and Starboard Founder and CEO and now Chairman of Papa John's, Jeff Smith. Guys, thanks for coming down and being with us. Steve, let me start with you. You know, you're in a no-growth category. Some people say Papa John's is behind on technology and your former CEO seems to have alienated a key constituency in your pizza-eating population. So, what are you going to do to change that?
STEVE RITCHIE: Well, thank first off David, thanks for having us here. It's great to be here. So, exciting day for the brand yesterday. So, a $200 million investment, and a great new partner with Starboard Value and Jeff Smith as new Chairman of the Board. I have got to tell you, I have been at the brand for 22 years. I started as a delivery driver for 6 bucks an hour. So this investment and this opportunity really gives us an opportunity to focus on what's most important. I started 22 years ago and I realized there was two key things that are most important and unique about the brand: one is our people and culture. So the opportunity to really focus in on transforming the culture of the brand. But what really struck me the most, my first day with the brand, is quality. We are the differentiated player in the category. And there's something really different about what we do at Papa John's that frankly I think there's more to the story we need to tell to consumers. Many people don't know that we have fresh, never-frozen original crust dough that's six simple ingredients. Folks don't know -- and that's different from the other folks. Folks don't realize that we use vine-ripened tomatoes that go from the vine to the can from the Central Valley in California. All of our tomatoes around the world are grown there. And other folks, we use packed -- not packed, but concentrated tomatoes. So this unique quality story is certainly one that we want to leverage. This new partnership with Jeff can really advance the company.
DAVID FABER: Alright. I'm getting hungry, but none of that is going to translate necessarily into selling more pizza. What is your role here, Jeff? What are you going to do to help him execute on some of the goals he just laid out?
JEFF SMITH: Yeah, David, pizza is fun, and it's about getting back to fun and making it fun again inside the company. For us, this is a partnership with Steve and with the board. And, you know, we approached the company and said we want to get involved and we want to help and we want to provide leadership 
DAVID FABER: Why? Why did you approach the company? What about it that you saw was an opportunity for Starboard? Potentially profit obviously.
JEFF SMITH: You know, I'll echo what Steve just said: I think it's the best quality pizza in the category. So starting with the best product in the category is always a good thing. Now they've lost their way a little bit. Not just in terms of image but also in terms of messaging. We can come back in and we can get our customers back and we can get them to come back and appreciate the brand. Better ingredients, better pizza is a good thing. We did a lot of taste tests inside of Starboard. The diligence was fun. I really enjoy the pizza and really believe it's the best. So that's where you want to go. We've got go back to talking about how much fun pizza is and how great the product is.
DAVID FABER: I can order a pizza on Domino's app very easily. Track the whole thing. Many say you guys are behind in technology. Are you going to change that?
STEVE RITCHIE: So we were the pioneer. We were the first to launch national online ordering back in 2001. We're still very proud of all of our technology systems today. We're going to continue to focus and invest in the customer experience. We also the first to launch a national loyalty program in the category. And we just refreshed. Launched a new loyalty program which we believe is now best-in-class where consumers have the flexibility to buy whatever product they want at Papa John's.
DAVID FABER: So you don't feel like you're behind at all? Those who say: well, you have got to spend more money.
STEVE RITCHIE: There's no doubt, David, that we've got to get better. And we're going to continue to invest in the areas of product and technology and people. We know that we need to improve the inner-economics for our franchisees. But at the end of the day, we are a company that is differentiated by our products. So I'm really pleased to say we're getting ready to launch a line of six new specialty pizzas coming up next month. We're getting ready to expand and think about menu variety. We're going to focus in on premium ingredients. So a lot of those investments are going to be into that area. We're really excited about that.
DAVID FABER: Many of us who know you well look back at Darden, of course the success you had there as an investment with an investment and, obviously, with all the board members you put on there. Is there a similarity here, Jeff, in terms of the approach you're taking with Papa John's as you did with Darden?
JEFF SMITH: It's actually really similar. So let's not focus on all of Darden, but really on Olive Garden. Because Olive garden was the struggling brand inside of Darden. And at the time -- people don't remember now because Olive Garden is doing so well. Gene Lee is the CEO, he has done a terrific job. Olive Garden is doing well. But at the time we made the investment, Olive Garden was struggling. Olive Garden was a chain that people were talking about where the -- it was a dying brand. Their customers were getting older, and what could be done to reinvigorate? I remember talking at the time we made the investment and people were saying thing like that. We got involved and really focused on the positives, focused on the competitive advantages and really built up the quality and, most importantly, the customer experience. The guest experience. We're going to do the same thing here. You know, in partnership with the company, in partnership with Steve, we believe the same opportunity exists. The quality is terrific. We have to focus on the competitive advantages and the customer experience. And the customer experience in pizza isn't just about the quality of the pizza, which you were talking about before, David. It's also about the whole experience. How do you order? How do you get it delivered? How do you have the whole experience and make it better? We're really excited about it. Actually, I mean, I think you guys and Jim were talking about the technology at Domino's. You know, their promotion right now is terrific. It's a terrific opportunity. It's a terrific opportunity as a de facto co-promotion for us. They're out there for the next six weeks saying go buy a different pizza and they'll give you rewards. So that's wonderful. We're loving that and invite the customers back to Papa John's. If you buy Domino's pizza, you just get Domino's rewards. Right now, if you come to Papa John's and come back to our pizza, you get our pizza, our rewards and their rewards, and they just get the picture, which is wonderful.
DAVID FABER: Steve, did you guys try and sell the company and fail to do so?
STEVE RITCHIE: No. You know, we had a -- it was a bit of a robust process. So we had a very comprehensive strategic review process, started September of last year. The independent members of the board, I, the special committee, you know, we looked at all options. It was a wide range of options. And you know, back to what we were just talking about what Jeff was just talking about, the Olive Garden deal there. But there's a number of other consumer-facing brands that Starboard was involved in. So we found the right financial resources to give us flexibility. But, frankly, even more importantly was those intangible values of leadership that has got experience in turn around brands. Obviously, we're in a moment of distress here. Look, it's been a difficult year for the brand but we know we have the plan to do the right things to move forward. And we brought on new leadership and an additional director also with Anthony, that's got 30 years of experience with consumer brands.
DAVID FABER: Mr. Snyder is still 26% holder roughly, I think, with the delusion from this convertible deal. And he likes to talk and he doesn't want to be ignored. Is he going to be a continued problem for the brand?
STEVE RITCHIE: You know, I think what we want to focus on is obviously what's doing the best interest of the stakeholders I talked about. Our team members, franchisees, our customers.
DAVID FABER: Have you talked to him? Has he agreed in is he happy or is he going to sort of start yelling and screaming about things to alienate customers?
STEVE RITCHIE: So as you stated, John is a very large shareholder with the brand and the decision that we arrived at was to do what was in the best interest of our shareholders and stakeholders. So obviously we believe that he's going to benefit from that as we 
DAVID FABER: Does he believe it? Does he believe it?
STEVE RITCHIE: John believes in the core values of the brand that I've talked about on quality and people. So, I certainly would not question that and, obviously, we're hopeful we can bring John along. It's a journey.
DAVID FABER: All right. Now it's time to talk Bristol-Myers. You're here. Do you own the stock?
JEFF SMITH: Talking about pizza, right?
DAVID FABER: No, we're talking about -- I've given you plenty of time to discuss it. Happy that we have. Do you own Bristol-Myers?
JEFF SMITH: I am not going to discuss Bristol-Myers today.
DAVID FABER: You can't not discuss Bristol-Myers with me here, Jeff, for this moment.
JEFF SMITH: I can.
DAVID FABER: I've just given you ten minutes to talk pizza.
JEFF SMITH: We love talking pizza. It's fun.
DAVID FABER: We've got -- Do you own Bristol-Myers? And if so, why?
JEFF SMITH: We are certainly interested in the story at Bristol-Myers.
DAVID FABER: Did you nominate any directors for the board?
JEFF SMITH: I'm not going to discuss that right now.
DAVID FABER: Why would you own Bristol-Myers? Do you not like the Celgene deal?
JEFF SMITH: Well, let me go back and talk more broadly.
DAVID FABER: Okay.
JEFF SMITH: So our job, we believe our job is to represent the best interest of shareholders. So we look at lots of situations and we get lots of calls from shareholders who may be upset with things that are going on at different companies. We evaluate those situations to try and determine whether we can have a positive impact in representing the best interest of those shareholders. Bristol-Myers might fit that profile.
DAVID FABER: But it might not.
JEFF SMITH: It might not fit that profile. We haven't made that decision. If we make that decision, I'll tell you what, I will come on and talk to you about it.
DAVID FABER: You'll want to come on and talk about it because it would be an uphill climb it would seem conceivably to defeat a deal, the vote on which is coming up very soon. Which is why many people wonder why you would own it, if you really were trying to beat down the Celgene deal, unless you just like Bristol-Myers.
JEFF SMITH: I think we'll have to talk about it at a later date.
DAVID FABER: And you did or did not nominate for the board?
JEFF SMITH: Can't answer that question.
DAVID FABER: Well, you can.
JEFF SMITH: I'm choosing not to answer that question.
DAVID FABER: Why?
JEFF SMITH: I think we're here to talk about pizza, David.
DAVID FABER: Well, we 
STEVE RITCHIE: What are you guys having for lunch today?
DAVID FABER: Well, we finished talking about pizza. But I will end with that briefly, to kind of end on a did you eat a lot of pizza?
JEFF SMITH: I ate a lot of pizza. We ate pizza -- a lot of pizza yesterday, too, at the company. We had a great time with the employees yesterday. Great time speaking with all of them and testing and having fun. I'll be back there on Thursday and Friday this week, testing more pizza and new concepts. This is fun. This is what I love to do.
DAVID FABER: Alright, well we appreciate you guys stopping by. Thank you both for joining us.
STEVE RITCHIE: Thanks for having us on. We appreciate it.

111,Brexit-hit UK assets look cheap — but investors are wary,"Fund managers have steered clear of stocks and sterling, bemused by EU exit outcomes",https://www.ft.com/content/f3118be4-24ad-11e9-8ce6-5db4543da632,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-01T04:00:27Z,"Fund managers seem unanimous: sterling and UK stocks look cheap. But many are so perplexed by the political wrangling over the UK’s exit from the EU, that they are finding it hard to pluck up the courage to buy. 
Value-focused investors have been sniffing around the FTSE 100 index, which has traded at a big discount to similar benchmarks in Europe and the US since the referendum of June 2016. The pound is down about 12 per cent over that period, according to Deutsche Bank’s trade-weighted measure, drawing some bargain hunters.
Yet sterling and UK stocks are among global fund managers’ biggest “underweights” compared with historical weightings, according to the latest monthly survey from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, meaning that they are happy to steer clear for now.
The problem is a lack of clarity over Brexit, say investors. With so many possible outcomes still on the table — from a managed transition to an abrupt departure — it is difficult to put a price on assets. Jim Leaviss, head of retail fixed income at M&amp;G Investments, says sterling could be up to 20 per cent undervalued, based on purchasing-power metrics. But he has kept his weighting in sterling assets neutral, the same as the benchmark, because he cannot be sure of a rally.
“It’s not analysable in any meaningful way; it’s a bit like gambling,” he says. “There are things where you think you’ve got an edge, and things where you certainly don’t have an edge.”
With Brexit hanging in the balance for so long it is no surprise that sterling and UK stocks have languished. The FTSE 100 trades on 12.3 times next year’s earnings, compared with the Stoxx 600 — a European benchmark — at 13.1 times and the S&amp;P 500 at 15.9 times. But with valuations at these levels, the key question is whether UK assets could do well whatever happens with the EU.
Markets tend to dislike unknowns. Uncertainty over a potential war in Iraq, for example, had weighed on stocks at the end of the bear market in early 2003. But once investors finally decided war had become inevitable, prices surged.
“On some measures, the UK stock market is at its lowest valuation for 30 years,” notes Paul Marshall, chairman of hedge fund Marshall Wace, which manages $39bn in assets. He adds that a “workable solution” on Brexit would help drive UK assets higher, although prolonged uncertainty would continue to be “taken badly by investors”.
Brooks Ritchey, head of portfolio construction at K2 Advisors, part of Franklin Templeton Investments, says that so many people are “short [the UK], that the surprise could be UK equities doing better than expected.” Nevertheless, he prefers betting on a recovery in Japan and emerging markets, which he thinks are “cleaner” scenarios than the UK.
The general lack of conviction can, in part, be explained by the UK’s relatively low weighting in the MSCI World index: just 5.7 per cent, compared to the US at more than 50 per cent. Missing out on a big rally, then, would be annoying but hardly career-ending for most managers. If they can find similar opportunities elsewhere, then why take on the UK’s peculiar risks?
Jacob Mitchell, founder and chief investment officer at Sydney-based Antipodes Partners, which manages around $6bn in assets, believes that while UK domestically focused companies look cheap, so do equivalent stocks around the world.
“We’d prefer to be in ING than Lloyds,” he says, comparing the Dutch lender to the biggest bank on Britain’s high street. “We’re a bit cautious on the UK economy. We don’t need to take that bet as we’re being offered similar returns without that risk.”
Despite the uncertainty, some investors are nibbling at UK assets. Sterling is up 2.9 per cent against the dollar this year, better than the yen, the euro and the Swiss franc. The FTSE 100 has crept up almost 4 per cent, more than some developed markets but less than the US and Europe.
Lansdowne Partners, one of the world’s biggest equity hedge funds with about $20bn in assets, increased its exposure to UK stocks in the three months to December, according to investor letters seen by the Financial Times.
“Barring a total collapse of the UK economy, the shares [of Lloyds] are incredibly cheap. The same increasingly applies to the other UK banks,” wrote managers Peter Davies and Jonathon Regis.
However, for some, the ongoing twists and turns of Brexit means it is better to try to make short-term profits than take a long-term view.
Jeff Donlon, managing director of global strategies at New York-based Manning &amp; Napier, which manages more than $20bn in assets, had in recent months been increasing exposure to the UK by buying domestic-focused stocks in the financials, real estate and housebuilding sectors most at risk from a no-deal Brexit. At the same time, he had been raising exposure to UK small-cap stocks and sterling. Mr Donlon’s bet had been that the probability of a no-deal had diminished in favour of a softer Brexit, or no Brexit at all.
But, as the likely outcome has shifted toward the UK and EU at a stand-off while the clock is run down, he has been cutting exposure again.
“Fears regarding a no-deal Brexit scenario being back in play [could] cause sentiment to turn negative,” he says.
“Ultimately, we’ve not solved anything.”"
112,The super-rich are an easy target for tax,Attempts to raise revenue must include the comfortably off as well as the ultra-wealthy,https://www.ft.com/content/1527e588-2482-11e9-8ce6-5db4543da632,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-01T05:00:54Z,"What should the top rate of income tax be? Should it be 70 per cent, as has been informally suggested by the young star of the US Democratic party, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez? That instinctively feels too high to me. But, as an economist with sporadic hopes of making logical arguments based on evidence, I admit that “instinctively feels too high” is a weak response.
What about 50 per cent, the official policy of the UK’s opposition Labour party at the last general election? Or zero, the optimal top rate that emerged from a thought experiment posed by the late James Mirrlees, a Nobel laureate in economics?
An alternative is to tax wealth instead of income, as US Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren has proposed. But — at least in principle — there is not much difference between a small annual tax on total wealth and a large tax on the nominal return generated by that wealth.
To make the case for a top rate of tax above 70 per cent, it helps to believe four things. 
The first is that taxable income itself won’t evaporate in the face of a high rate, as it did in the UK when the top tax rate was briefly raised from 40 to 50 per cent in 2010, then cut to 45 per cent. Most high earners found it easy to realise income early, or late, and avoid the 50 per cent rate. A permanent increase is harder to avoid; so is an increase that is enforced with determined (or draconian) measures; as is an increase levied by a large economy with global legislative reach such as the US. In smaller economies such as the UK’s, the very rich are more likely to take themselves elsewhere for any given tax rate.
One academic paper produced by Emmanuel Saez (a star in the study of inequality) and Peter Diamond (a Nobel laureate and colleague of Mirrlees) estimated that the combined rate of tax on the income of high earners could be 73 per cent in the US without proving counter-productive. Another paper, published in the same journal, by Gregory Mankiw and co-authors, put the optimal top rate at just under 50 per cent instead. The difference lies in the assumptions.
The second thing one needs to believe is that the rich will barely miss any extra income if tax rates rise. The truth of this is unknowable, although another famous study from yet more Nobel laureates, Daniel Kahneman and Angus Deaton, suggests that money will not improve your everyday mood and wellbeing after an income of $75,000 a year or so. To reach their conclusions about the 73 per cent rate, Professors Diamond and Saez assume that a dollar is 25 times more valuable to a person on about $50,000 a year than to a person on $500,000. That is not an insane assumption, but it’s an assumption nonetheless.
If you accept these first two beliefs, the economic case for a high top rate of tax follows. A high rate maximises revenue if the tax base doesn’t shrink too much, and revenue maximisation is a reasonable goal if it’s true that the rich would barely notice the lost income.
But this argument ranges far beyond economics. If you like high tax rates, the third thing it helps to believe is that inequality is intrinsically corrosive. Perhaps it undermines democracy. Perhaps it causes stress, envy or resentment. The empirical evidence is not much help here; it is sketchy and often seems tendentious. Causal channels are unclear: does inequality lead to a hollowed-out state? Or does a hollowed-out state enable inequality?
Perhaps a thought-experiment is more helpful here: how would you feel about a policy that simply confiscated resources from the super-rich and destroyed them? Would such a policy be a criminal waste and a grotesque infringement of liberty, or a helpful rebalancing of the scales?
Then there’s a fourth, often unstated, belief: that the rich have so much money that a high rate of tax will raise serious revenue. That depends on who you regard as “rich”. Ms Ocasio-Cortez mentioned a threshold of $10m. Profs Diamond and Saez focused on the highest earning 1 per cent of taxpayers, implying that the band would apply above around $500,000 a year. The Labour party wanted its highest rates to apply on incomes over £100,000. These are very different definitions of “rich” and they have very different implications for revenue.
For example, Ms Ocasio-Cortez’s income threshold of $10m is higher than that required to get into the top 0.01 per cent of the US income distribution: about 16,000 families. This tiny slice of the US population receives a less-than-tiny 5 per cent of total US income — which nevertheless implies that 95 per cent of income is earned by those making less. The super-rich are a tempting target, but a serious attempt to raise revenue cannot stop with them.
Whether we are talking about income or wealth, the lion’s share lies not with the billionaires but with the comfortably off. It is nice to talk about taxing somebody else’s money, but in a world of chronic budget deficits and worsening demographics, the ethics and economics of higher tax rates are unlikely to remain someone else’s problem.

113,Cigna sinks on investor worries about Trump drug rebate rule change,"Cigna CEO David Cordani doesn't see the Trump administration's new proposal to cut Medicare pharmacy benefit rebates as a threat to its growth, as it embarks on integrating its newly acquired PBM firm Express Scripts.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/01/cigna-sinks-on-investor-worries-about-trump-rebate-rule-change.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-01T16:36:00Z,"Cigna CEO David Cordani doesn't see the Trump administration's new proposal to cut Medicare pharmacy benefit rebates as a threat to its growth, as it embarks on integrating its newly acquired PBM firm Express Scripts.
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
""The proposed rebate rule will not have a meaningful impact on our growth or earnings trajectory,"" Cordani told analysts, on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call Friday, adding that its Medicare plans are already designed to pass through discounts to members.
""So, we don't see a major implication to that business portfolio. And it does not apply to the commercial marketplace,"" he said. ""We do see some opportunities in the proposed rule to even further accelerate value based care programs with the pharmaceutical manufacturers.""
Late Thursday, the Trump administration proposed ending the rebate system for Medicare and other government health plans, which officials argue provide a ""perverse incentive"" for pharmaceutical makers to set artificially high list prices on drugs.
The news sent shares of companies in the drug supply chain lower after hours, and the losses continued in early trading Friday.
Cigna's Express Scripts is the nation's largest pharmacy benefit manager, with more than 80 million members; its shares fell as much as 5 percent. Shares of rivals CVS Health fell nearly 2 percent and UnitedHealth Group was down just over 1 percent in early trade.
Cigna shares were also under pressure after the health insurer forecast earnings and revenues for the firm's first year as a combined firm that were below Wall Street estimates.
Cigna is now expecting 2019 adjusted profits of $16 to $16.50 per share, well below the analyst consensus estimate of $16.74 per share, according to average estimates compiled by Refinitiv IBES. The insurer says it expects full-year revenues in the range of $131.5 billion to $133.5 billion, compared to the analyst estimate of $133.6 billion.
Analysts say management is likely being conservative because of a number of competitive shifts in the PBM's business. Rival Anthem will be transitioning its members from Express Scripts to its own in-house pharmacy benefits unit earlier than expected, while Cigna will be transitioning away from its contract with UnitedHealth's PBM OptumRx.
""Cigna may be setting a conservative 2019 bar against which it has confidence it can execute a 'beat and raise' pattern over the course of this year,"" noted BMO Capital Market analyst Matt Borsch in a research report.
Cigna reported fourth-quarter adjusted profits of $2.46 per share, which were 4 cents above the Refinitiv analyst estimate, as it reined in medical costs. The results for the quarter included 11 days of earnings as a combined company.

114,American manufacturing companies have a spring in their step,The scaling back of Foxconn’s plans to make televisions in Wisconsin is offset by other good news,https://www.economist.com/business/2019/02/09/american-manufacturing-companies-have-a-spring-in-their-step,"{'id': 'the-economist', 'name': 'The Economist'}",2019-02-07T16:05:13Z,"A DRIVE ALONG the narrow county roads of Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, used to be a sleepy affair. You would spot a pumpkin farm, the odd homestead and red barn. But a recent visit revealed a cacophonous building site: a factory is emerging in this corner of the Midwest. Where chicken coops once stood, Foxconn, a Taiwanese contract-manufacturing giant best-known for assembling iPhones, has arrived.
Get our daily newsletterUpgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.
When in 2017 the firm announced plans to build a massive factory for high-end televisions, many cheered, not least President Donald Trump, who came for last years ground breaking ceremony. Electronics manufacturers had long ago abandoned America for cheaper countries, especially China, so the investment seemed to mark a reversal. Having secured a promise of over $4bn in subsidies from Wisconsin, Foxconn vowed to create 13,000 jobs, many of them on the assembly line, with an average annual salary of $54,000.
But what Foxconn will do in these hinterlands is now in question. The company has discovered that it is hard to get thousands of Midwesterners to work long hours at stressful assembly-line jobs for relatively low pay. Last week Mr Trump personally intervened and persuaded Foxconns boss, Terry Gou, not to pull out. Even so, Foxconn has scaled back its mass-manufacturing plans, and an insider confirms that it will now make only unspecified quantities of high-value products. It has not retracted its jobs promise, but observers doubt if it will hire at the scale it originally envisaged.
At first glance, the Foxconn reversal confirms that American manufacturing is in trouble. Consider the recent wobbles at other big firms with local factories. Electrolux, a Swedish white-goods giant, announced on January 31st that it is shutting down an oven-making plant in Memphis, Tennessee. It blamed higher costs arising from the Trump administrations tariffs on imported steel and aluminium, as well as the bankruptcy of Sears, a big retailer that sold its products. On January 28th, Caterpillar, a legendary American maker of heavy equipment, reported disappointing profits for the fourth quarter thanks in part to a slowdown in Chinas economy, which has been hit by Americas trade war.
A closer look, however, suggests manufacturing is undergoing a revival, especially among agile smaller firms and those using advanced techniques. According to the Bureau of Labour Statistics, manufacturing employment leapt by 261,000 jobs in 2018, reaching a total of 12.8m, coming after another rise in 2017, of 207,000 jobs. The sector has rebounded from the financial crisis of 2008-09 (see chart 1). The Institute for Supply Managements manufacturing purchasing-managers index, a closely-watched indicator, rose to 56.6 in January from 54.3 in December (a figure above 50 signals expansion). It has shown expansion for 29 consecutive months.
With characteristic modesty, Mr Trump is claiming most of the credit. His tax-reform package, passed at the end of 2017 by Congress, reduced corporate-tax rates, made capital investment more attractive and cut the incentive for American multinationals to hoard cash overseas. Though some firms have used the bounty from tax reform to undertake big share buy-backs, it seems that large firms are increasing investments in plant and equipment in America. Analysts at Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, estimate that the big industrial firms of the S&amp;P 500 index (leaving out the large technology firms) during the first three quarters of 2018 spent $460bn on capital expenditures, up from $400bn in the same period in 2017.
In a survey of leading American firms released on January 28th by the National Association for Business Economics, a trade association, four times as many firms in the goods-producing sector (which includes manufacturing) expect to increase capital spending in the next three months as those expecting to cut spending. Foreign direct investment into American manufacturing shot up to roughly $185bn during the first nine months of 2018, compared with under $100bn in 2017.
Yet forces that predate Mr Trumps arrival into the White House are also boosting the fortunes of American factories. A new analysis by the Boston Consulting Group, a consultancy, shows that the cost of manufacturing is approaching parity for the two economic superpowers (see chart 2) whereas 15 years ago Chinese costs were over an eighth lower. Manufacturers were bringing supply chains home (partly by investing in automation) well before Mr Trump took office, according to a forthcoming report from the Conference Board, a research group. Researchers conclude that nearly two-thirds of manufacturers in America, domestic and foreign, in leading sectors were localising sourcing and manufacturing from 2011 to 2016, and only about a quarter were globalising. Since Mr Trumps election, higher oil prices have helped manufacturing businesses linked to the energy industry.
The report also offers clues as to what went wrong in Wisconsin. Electronics was among the sectors that did the least reshoring during the period studied. This is because electronics supply chains and innovation ecosystems in China are highly specialised, efficient and hard to duplicate. In contrast, the automobile and metals industries were aggressive localisers.
To catch a glimpse of what could be the future of American manufacturing, travel to southern New England, home of Americas first manufacturing boom two centuries ago. Here, Mr Trump has been good for Trumpf. The German firms North American headquarters and manufacturing hub in Farmington, Connecticut, is bustling. Trumpf makes machine tools, each costing $500,000 or more, that cut, bend and shape metal with the aid of proprietary lasers. Unlike the traditional metal-bashing kit found on typical factory floors, which are cost-effective only for mass production, these computer-controlled marvels allow short runs and high variation, making mass customisation economic.
Business is booming. Trumpf counts such American industrial icons as John Deere, a manufacturer of tractors, and Toro, which makes lawnmowers, as customers. Sales rose 21% to $699m in the year to June 2018, and were a healthy $400m in the second half of 2018. Customers frequently cite tax breaks from being able to expense the cost more quickly as reasons for investment. Behind a giant tarpaulin in Trumpfs factory can be glimpsed a new assembly-line being built for its next-generation offering. Trumpf has also spent some $30m building a factory of the future in Chicago, close to its industrial clients.
In Cromwell, a nearby town by the bucolic Connecticut River, John Carey, founder of Carey Manufacturing, reflects on his small companys experience with reshoring. The family-controlled firm makes automobile components as well as metallic handles and latches for such things as toolboxes. Unable to face a flood of cheap Chinese imports around 2000, he outsourced operations to mainland China but found it to be a race to the bottom on quality and price. He brought back the work to America starting in 2014, a process he has accelerated in the past two years. He invested $2.5m in equipment from Trumpf and embraced advanced manufacturing. Consumers want products in ever greater variety, on demand, and Trumpfs advanced tools allow even small manufacturers like Carey to be nimble. Carey is growingit hopes to earn $4m in revenues from reshored product lines in 2019, more than double the figure three years ago.
Mr Carey praises Mr Trump for taking on Chinas unfair subsidies, but berates him for his steel and aluminium tariffs, which have raised his costs. Like Foxconn, his firms big challenge is finding enough skilled workers. America needs a system of apprenticeships like that of Germany, he says. Instead of wasting billions on a border wall with Mexico, he argues, Mr Trump should spend the money helping develop a highly-skilled manufacturing workforce. The evidence suggests that if America builds it, companies will come.

In a blog post on LinkedIn, Serkan Kutan, the former technology chief at doctor-booking start-up Zocdoc, wrote that, ""I am thrilled to now announce that I am serving as CTO of this new venture."" Kutan's LinkedIn profile says he took the job in January. 
A spokesperson for the health initiative confirmed Kutan's hiring. 
The three companies came together a year ago to announce the formation of the non-profit-seeking venture, whose purpose is to improve health quality and bring down costs for employees. Dr. Atul Gawande, a writer and surgeon, was named CEO in June. 
Not much has been shared yet on Gawande's plan or the overall strategy of the project, but Kutan described it as ""the most promising attempt to improve health care in the U.S.""
Kutan said in the post that he received a news alert about the hiring of Gawande last year and thought to himself, ""to be the CTO for this initiative would be a dream job.""
Kutan's previous role at Zocdoc involved building the technology that consumers use to book doctors' appointments. Zocdoc is one of the few health companies that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has personally funded through his investment group, Bezos Expeditions.

She dodged any visual mishaps that befell her predecessors (over-moisturized lips in 2018, awkward thirst-quenching in 2013) and clearly communicated Democrats’ agenda. The first-ever black woman to assume the role, Abrams touched on lowering health care costs and passing a more inclusive immigration policy. She also pressed an issue she holds especially close: voting access.
This is the next battle for our democracy, one where all eligible citizens can have their say about the vision we want for our country, she said. Her message, sprinkled with personal anecdotes, will only feed speculation that she’s eyeing her next electiona 2020 Senate run.
Even before Abrams formally responded to Trump, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued her own impromptu feedback, making the most of her reclaimed seat behind the presidentone that’s well within the camera shot.
At times during Trump’s address, Pelosi grimaced, shook her head, and smirked. When Trump said that only “politics or ridiculous partisan investigations” could slow the economy, she visibly scoffed. And then there was the meme-ified moment when Pelosi clappedarms outstretch toward the president, perhaps to indicate sarcasmas Trump urged lawmakers to “reject the politics of revenge, resistance and retribution, and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise and the common good.” Yes, from this time forward, Nancy Pelosi’s “clap-back” will be part of Internet lore.
Pelosi issued her body language rebukes dressed in all white, like the rest of her female colleagues from the House. The tradition honors suffragettes, but the practice sent an even starker visual message this year since the sea of white reflected Democrat’s electoral gains, especially those by women candidates.
The female Democrats were largely unmoved by Trump’s speech, but there was a moment when they roared. “Exactly one century after Congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in Congress than at any time before,” Trump said. “Thats great. Really great. And congratulations.”
The remark was met with cheers and high-fives among the white-wearers, along with one audible, “Thank you, Nancy!”
It seems for a moment, at least, the president couldn’t ignore the female presence in front of himor the one behind him either."
118,N.Y. Mayor Says Amazon HQ2 Will Prevail as City Needs Tech,Bill de Blasio says New York needs the tech industry because it can no longer rely upon Wall Street as an economic growth generator.,http://fortune.com/2019/02/05/n-y-mayor-says-amazon-hq2-will-prevail-as-city-needs-tech/,"{'id': 'fortune', 'name': 'Fortune'}",2019-02-05T18:54:31Z,"New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said he thinks Amazon will prevail in building its huge new campus in the city — despite an opponent being recommended to serve on a board with veto power over the transaction.
De Blasio said he didnt think any elected official wanted to be the one who cost the city as many as 40,000 well-paid jobs. New York needs the tech industry, de Blasio said, because it can no longer rely upon Wall Street as an economic growth generator.
I dont think anyone would want to take the blame for losing the biggest jobs deal in the history of NYC and thats why I think it will go through, de Blasio said in response to a question at an unrelated press conference Tuesday in Brooklyn.
New York State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins on Monday chose a leading opponent of the $2.5 billion deal as one of three members of a board with veto power over the transaction. Senator Michael Gianaris, a Democrat who represents Long Island City, Queens, where Amazon intends to build a new office, has criticized the $3 billion in government incentives as a giveaway to corporate interests.
The state Public Authorities Control Board must unanimously approve projects financed through debt-raising state agencies. Governor Andrew Cuomo must approve all picks for the board.
Gianaris said he couldnt imagine any changes to the Amazon agreement that would sway his view and win his support. Cuomo initially said the board lacked jurisdiction over the transaction, but recently changed his mind and said he believed that the board would have to approve it.
The deal as presented is so historically bad it cant form the basis of a reasonable negotiation, and the typical horse-trading that occurs to obtain community approval is not going to work here, Gianaris said in an interview.
Amazon expected it would face the biggest public backlash to a new headquarters in New York City, according to a person familiar with its decision-making process. Amazon chose the location anyway, since the city offered a large skilled-labor pool, and ample opportunities for spouses and partners of recruited hires to find employment to further their own careers, the person said. Its building a similar project in Arlington, Virginia.
At a city council meeting last week, Amazons public policy director Brian Huseman said the project would generate $186 billion in economic activity over the next 25 years, including $14 billion in additional tax payments and 25,000 jobs.
“We believe this project will be a positive economic impact for the city and the state,” he said. “Were here to create jobs.” He also said that Amazon wants to invest in a community that wants us and where our employees and our company are welcome.
Almost immediately after Seattle-based Amazon announced last year that it chose New York, there has been a backlash from lawmakers and community organizers in the Empire State. They fear the influx could push out existing residents and add to congestion on the already overcrowded subway.
Dani Lever, director of communications for Cuomo, criticized Gianariss appointment, saying it would put the state in further economic peril just hours after the governor reported income tax collections came in $2.3 billion below expectations for December and January, and that the state may be entering an economic slowdown.
Gianariss recommendation puts the self-interest of a flip-flopping opponent of the Amazon project above the states economic growth and is a clear sign that the Senate Democrats oppose the 25,000 to 40,000 new technology jobs that would diversify our states economy, Lever said.
New York Beats Out San Francisco to Be Worlds Best Tech City
In November, after Amazon announced its intention to expand in the city, Cuomo said the board didnt have jurisdiction over a $505 million state capital grant that was part of a state and city package of incentives designed to lure the company to the banks of the East River. He also said the comprehensive project plan, drafted by the Empire State Development Corp. may give the board jurisdiction.
Weve done this on Moynihan Train Station, we did it for the New York Times headquarters building, Cuomo said during a WNYC radio interview. It is typical for large-scale projects to be done this way. Most of the large economic development projects have been.
The board has killed large-scale projects in the past, such as a combined stadium and convention center proposed in 2005 by former Mayor Michael Bloomberg for Manhattans west side, when then-Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, vetoed the plan. The former mayor is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.
As Cuomo and De Blasio described it, Amazons arrival would bring 25,000 jobs to the city within 10 years, and as many as 40,000 positions in 25 years — creating as much as $27.5 billion in tax revenue. City and state incentives totaling $3 billion is a comparatively small price to pay for economic development of this size, they say.
Complete malarkey, countered Gianaris, who joined City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer at a rally to protest the deal after the announcement. Gianaris says Cuomos calculations of tax revenue were based on a comparison as if the site would remain empty, when in fact, the site had already been planned for development.
City Council Speaker Corey Johnson has attacked the company for resisting union representation of its workers and because Cuomo and de Blasio structured it to avoid the councils normal land-use review."

When I wrote earlier this week that I thought it was a good idea for ex-Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz to run for president, my colleague Claire Zillman warned me to brace for some spirited feedback. Well, I did get a flood of feedback, but surprisingly, most of it positive. CEO Daily readers seem to be in favor. A small sampling:
I fully agree with your recommendation that Howard ‘Go for it!’ The country needs a middle. We are losing our younger generation to leftist crazies and the older generation to the far right …. but most people are in, or close to, the middle.”
–RG
I do not know that I would or would not vote for Howard Schultz, but I like that he threw his hat into the ring as an Independent If he ran for either partys nomination, he would be shouted down. As an Independent, he will have an open mic, at least until right before Labor Day.
–NR
There is an available majority in the center for a true leader who is willing to find sensible compromises that solve problems without regard for partisan pandering. Who’s to say Schultz would draw more votes from a left-wing Dem than from Trump? There are lots of disaffected Republicans still identifying R or in that increasing Independent cohort who would jump at the chance to vote for a responsible centrist.”

On the other side, there was this:
In the end, third party candidates are indicators of the level of division in the country. They have never been solutions to that division.”
–HB
Im not sure I can argue with that historical analysis.
Separately, LS wrote in after yesterdays post on the Feds suspension of interest rate increases, where I said black swans must be circling:
This is all natural response to secular stagnation. You are right that there are risks, but there are also recession risks in continuing to raise rates.

120,Microsoft Aims to Connect Patient Health Records in the Cloud,"Microsoft Corp. is releasing a service to help health-care companies move vast amounts of patient data to its cloud and connect with other related systems in a bid to offer clinicians, individuals and researchers a more comprehensive view of patient health.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-07/microsoft-aims-to-connect-patient-health-records-in-the-cloud,"{'id': 'bloomberg', 'name': 'Bloomberg'}",2019-02-07T16:51:14Z,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. is releasing a service to help health-care companies move vast amounts of patient data to its cloud and connect with other related systems in a bid to offer clinicians, individuals and researchers a more comprehensive view of patient health.     
The tool, based on Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform and a national standard for exchanging health records, will let disparate health systems talk to each other, for example hooking up patient records with pharmacy systems, fitness devices and others more seamlessly.Health care lags behind some other industries in moving data to internet-based storage, and while health records have mostly gone digital, they are often stored in different databases that can’t share information easily. That makes it hard to create systems that use new artificial intelligence and data analysis techniques to track patient well-being and find new targeted therapies.  A better-connected health-care system would provide clinicians with more complete profiles of their patients, researchers with more data to study and individuals with more information to take control of their health, according to Microsoft.  It’s also an attempt to help Microsoft attract companies to Azure over market leader Amazon Web Services.
Microsoft will also continue to add new health-care tools to Azure, said Peter Lee, vice president of Microsoft Healthcare, in an interview. “It’s hard to think of data standards for interoperability as a sexy topic,” he said, but it’s critical to a host of new healthcare applications. The software giant has been pushing into health care in fits and starts over the past several years. Recently it has been working on cloud and artificial-intelligence products to help reduce data-entry tasks for doctors, triage patients and provide more-targeted cancer care. Last month, Microsoft announced an Azure deal with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. The drugstore company said it will use Azure for services that connect patients’ health-care data with clinicians and pharmacists, among other things. 
To be successful in health care, Microsoft must train its software and artificial intelligence tools to be familiar with medical needs and terminology and must comply with a complex set of privacy requirements around healthcare data.  Microsoft will announce the new Azure service next week at the HIMSS healthcare conference in Orlando, Florida.  One example the company will show is using the service to create an app for scheduling hospital nurses. Microsoft also plans to announce about three dozen organizations that are already trying the new tool, Lee said.
In other health-care initiatives, Microsoft is making its health-care bot more widely available. The tool helps health-care organizations build their own chatbots and virtual assistants. After being introduced in 2017 as a research project, the service is already in use by customers like Premera Blue Cross for helping customers get general information on insurance claims and benefits. Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta developed an app for patients to ask questions about medication or details of their schedule. About 350 new organizations have began building their own bots since an initial preview a few months ago, Lee said
Microsoft also has a pilot project to use the health bot in the future to help patients find clinical trials for new drugs and therapies, Lee said. The idea is to combine work Microsoft is already doing on using artificial intelligence to scan complex medical documents related to clinical trial information with a bot interface. A patient could, for example, search for breast cancer trials and answer some questions from the bot that would then recommend trials that might be appropriate. Right now trial documents can be hard to comb though and understand, Lee said.
The health bot can also be used to help customers stick with prescriptions and ask them questions via text if they don’t fill their prescriptions to detect problems. Sometimes patients forget what a particular drug is if they’ve removed it from the container – Microsoft’s computer vision software could let patients scan the pills and identify them, Lee said. 
The Redmond, Washington-based company is also working on getting health-care teams on to its Microsoft Teams chat software -- which competes with Slack Technologies Inc. – in order to better coordinate care, particularly when there are as many as 20 people caring for a single patient and most rely on mobile phones as they walk around hospitals. New capabilities will allow electronic health records that comply with the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources standard to be integrated with Teams, so that hospital staff can access patient records in the same app where they take notes, message with other team members and manage care. Microsoft would also like to enable health-care teams to add parents of hospitalized patients to these chat groups, in order to keep them up to speed on their child’s care, Lee said."
121,The subtle sound of debt: Mastercard joins the race for consumers’ ears — with a little help from Linkin Park,Mastercard consulted musicologists and as many as 45 recording artists — 'not a cheap affair',https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/mastercard-is-a-sound,"{'id': 'financial-post', 'name': 'Financial Post'}",2019-02-08T18:22:21Z,"Mastercard Inc. on Thursday announced it spent two years composing a jaunty sound that will play when customers buy things with its credit cards. This sound — the Mastercard Melody — is to be a sort of musical logo, beeping from point-of-sale machines and smartphone wallets across the globe, announcing each successful transaction like a fife and drum corps on a march into debt.
“It has been a massive undertaking so far,” said Raja Rajamannar, Mastercard’s chief marketing officer.
The search for the Mastercard sound was guided by a set of principles: “It should not be intrusive; it should be subtle,” he said. It had to be simple and neutral, not dominating.
“We want you to feel comforted,” Rajamannar said.
In launching the sound, Mastercard is joining the increasingly crowded competition for consumer ears, rather than eyeballs.
It’s an acknowledgement, Rajamannar said, that space for visual ads is shrinking — choked by the popularity of add-free online streaming. “You really need to add your presence to other senses,” he said. And there is growing space for “audio signatures” on podcasts and smart speakers like Google Home and Amazon Echo.
The sound — ba da ba ba bo ba — will be used in transaction noises at the point of sale, as well as a “signature” sound at the end of commercials and on-hold music. The sound will be rolled out gradually around the world, and expected to play after virtually every Mastercard transaction within three to five years.
“It’s not overnight,” Rajamannar said.
Its release Thursday is the conclusion of Mastercard’s two-year modernization plan, devised in response to unsettling consumer surveys that found the Mastercard brand a tad too traditional, Rajamannar said.
We want you to feel comforted
Raja Rajamannar, Mastercard's chief marketing officer
Earlier phases of the plan included last month’s drastic move to drop the company name from the company logo and slightly enlarge the company’s trademark intersecting circles. “It’s absolutely risky,” he said of the logo change. “No question about it. That’s the reason we researched and researched.”
For its new melody, Mastercard consulted musicologists and as many as 45 recording artists, such as Linkin Park’s Mike Shinoda, and solicited hundreds of song submissions.
It was not a “cheap affair.”
“It’s a real, serious investment,” Rajamannar said. “I cannot give you a ballpark but it’s not cheap, let me assure you of that. It’s not a low number. It’s global, with a multiplicity of versions and the celebrities involved. I will leave it to your best guess.”
After months of research and shortlisting, Rajamannar’s team chose its melody — a piece of music that Mastercard could use as “sonic architecture.” Essentially, it was basically a master version that was then adapted or condensed to fit various purposes: a short one, just four or six notes, for transactions, and longer ones for TV commercial soundtracks.
Mastercard hired musicians who effectively translated the master version to fit their genre or region while keeping the melody more or less the same. There is, for instance, an opera version, an electronic dance music version, and variations for Dubai, Cape Town, and Bogota.
“You’re in India, you’re in China, you’re in Latin America,” Rajamannar said, “you should not feel the melody is alien to you.”

122,Amazon stock falls during 4Q earnings call after warning of increased investments,"Amazon’s fourth-quarter report was a beat across the board, but weak guidance and general concerns about slowing growth and heavier investments dragged the stock down in after hours trading.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/31/amazon-earnings-q4-2018.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-01T00:19:15Z,"Last SlideNext Slide
Amazons fourth-quarter report was a beat across the board, but weak guidance and general concerns about slowing growth and heavier investments dragged the stock down in after hours trading.
Here are the most important numbers:
 EPS: $6.04 vs. $5.68 estimated, according to Refinitiv
 Revenue: $72.4 billion vs. $71.9 billion estimated, according to Refinitiv
 AWS: $7.43 billion vs. $7.3 billion estimated, according to Refinitiv
Amazon shares dropped more than 5 percent in extended trading after the company warned of increased spending in 2019, following a relatively slow investment period last year. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky noted during the call with analysts that the company had significantly scaled back investments last year, across hiring and capital expenditures and that it could get back to spending mode this year.
I would expect investments to increase relative to 2018, Olsavsky said.
The better-than-expected revenue, backed by strong holiday sales, comes amid concerns of slowing growth at Amazon, as the company failed to beat revenue expectations in the past two quarters. The fourth-quarter saw a 19.7 percent jump in revenue, which was faster than the 18.8 percent expected, but still the slowest since the first quarter of 2015.

This was the first time to get a fully comparable year-over-year number on Whole Foods, a slower-growing business. That likely contributed to the slowing North American sales, which saw its growth rate drop to 18 percent from the year-ago periods 42 percent. International sales also slowed down to 15 percent compared to the previous years 29 percent growth rate.
AWS, however, continued to see strong results, maintaining its 45 percent growth rate from last year. Its Other segment, mostly comprised of its advertising business, jumped 95 percent to $3.4 billion in revenue.
First-quarter revenue guidance fell short of expectations, coming in between $56 billion and $60 billion, slightly below the $60.8 billion consensus estimated by FactSet. The disappointing guidance could partly be related to changes in e-commerce regulations in India which is expected to force Amazon to change the way its marketplace is run in the country.
Meanwhile, the company continued to set record profits for the third consecutive quarter, with $3 billion in net income, up 66 percent from last year. Amazon has seen a huge boost in profitability in recent years, after seeing growth in businesses like cloud, advertising and the third-party marketplace, where margins are bigger but sales are smaller. Amazon is historically known for running on thin margins because it reinvests most of its profits back into the company.
Amazon finished the year with $232.9 billion in annual revenue, passing the $200 billion milestone for the first time. Cash and equivalents jumped 51 percent to $21 billion.
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos highlighted the success of the Alexa voice-assistant in the earnings release.
Alexa was very busy during her holiday season. Echo Dot was the best-selling item across all products on Amazon globally, and customers purchased millions more devices from the Echo family compared to last year, Bezos said in a statement.
Amazon stock is up 18 percent over the past year. Its market cap, more than $840 billion as of Thursday afternoon, is the largest of any publicly traded company in the world.

But that's not exactly the case.
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
Grocery shoppers are still concerned they're being charged higher prices online and complain about delivery drivers being late, among other disappointments. 
In the U.S., a mere 3 percent of grocery spending takes place online today. Americans haven't been as quick to jump on board with placing their grocery orders from their computers or smartphones, especially when compared with markets like the U.K. and South Korea, where online grocery penetration can be as high as 15 percent.
Only a quarter of consumers have tried an online grocery service in the past year, according to a new survey of more than 8,000 U.S. grocery shoppers completed by consulting group Bain &amp; Co. in collaboration with Google. And only 26 percent of those shoppers, or 6 percent of all U.S. consumers, went on to say they order groceries online more than once a month. Instead, most Americans are taking multiple trips to the grocery store each week.
""We've been early adopters in this country in almost every other retail category,"" Bain &amp; Co. partner Stephen Caine said. ""We know online grocery will explode at some point.""
For now, though, grocery chains like Albertsons and Ahold Delhaize and delivery providers like Instacart and FreshDirect alike are grappling with how to get more shoppers to take advantage of their services. Fear of Amazon's dominance has pushed many companies to make these investments, even if they eat into profits.
""If one retailer is doing it, the others need to offer it,"" Stewart Samuel, program director at food and consumer goods research organization IGD, said. ""It does have the potential to bring in new customers to your business. ... Retailers wouldn't be expanding [grocery delivery] at this pace if customers weren't responding.""
Still, there's some convincing to be done.
Many shoppers want to be able to see and even touch certain food like meat or produce before they buy it. That's also why packaged goods like chips and granola bars tend to be the most popular items placed in online shopping carts. And then there are always flaws with delivery services, like items being out of stock or a driver being late.
Only 42 percent of people using a grocery delivery service for the first time say it actually saves them time, according to Bain &amp; Co.'s survey. One bad experience can potentially ruin a shopper's perception of the concept and make them never want to try it again. It's important for a company to get it right the first time because 75 percent of online grocery shoppers say they continue to use the first retailer they shopped from, the survey found.
And then there are other trust issues over pricing.
Typically, there are two pricing models that retailers follow when deciding how to mark up groceries and delivery fees online, Caine explained.
One is: a retailer will price items on the internet exactly like they would be in stores and then be transparent about how much the extra service charges are on top of that. Second is: a retailer will hike prices on items online to cover for the extra fees. Because some prices are noticeably inflated, ""people tend to minimize what [groceries] they buy online because they think they are getting fleeced,"" Caine said. ""You don't know whether you are getting a fair price."""

Bansal said in an interview with Bloomberg Tuesday that he is ""looking forward to the next chapter"" of his life after his shock resignation, which came after a Walmart investigation into alleged ""serious personal misconduct.""

Bansal was hesitant to speak about the details of the events that led up to his exit from the firm, according to Bloomberg. ""Now, it's all in the past. I have moved on,"" he said.
The former Flipkart chief executive has formed a team for his new project, xto10x Technologies, according to the report, and has set up shop at a co-working space and done deals with several ""leading"" start-ups.
The firm is aimed at helping customers build cloud-enabled products tailored to their needs. Bansal described it as an ""Amazon Web Services"" for start-ups and said his long-term ambition is to help ""10,000 early and mid-stage entrepreneurs.""
With a population of over 1.3 billion, India has seen rapid growth in its digital economy, with the likes of Flipkart, Snapdeal and Paytm shaking up the domestic e-commerce industry. Research by software lobbyist Nasscom and consultant PwC estimates India's online retail market could be valued at $150 billion by 2022.

125,Rising gold prices restore shine to mining sector,Fears over growth slowdown fuel second weekly gain for precious metal,https://www.ft.com/content/62c37aba-2611-11e9-8ce6-5db4543da632,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-01T17:09:10Z,"Investors seeking protection for their savings in stocks with exposure to gold have been left sorely disappointed by mining companies over the past few years. 
Global mining groups have underperformed the gold price and those listed in London have also been hit by production delays and boardroom drama. Last year the best performing and largest gold producer, Randgold Resources, left the City after it was acquired by Canadian rival, Barrick Gold. 
But an uptick in gold prices to their highest level in nine months and signs of consolidation have restored some shine to the sector. One of the biggest problems for gold miners is replacing the reserves they mine, which is difficult to do through exploration. 
The price of gold hit $1,321 a troy ounce on Friday, its second weekly gain, driven by fears over a slowdown in global growth and a statement from the Federal Reserve that it had put further interest rate rises on hold. 
Chaarat Gold
One emerging gold miner is Chaarat Gold, which said this week it had completed its acquisition of the Kapan mine in Armenia from Russian miner Polymetal for $55m. The deal gives the UK-listed company its first producing gold mine. 
Artem Volynets, chief executive of Chaarat, said he wanted to build the company into a miner with “substantial production” in Central Asia, Armenia and Russia. 
“I’ll be planning to grow through M&amp;A,” he said. “We’re working on that front and we have a number of leads. We are very actively working full speed ahead and Kapan is just the start.” 
The company has two development projects in Kyrgyzstan and has the potential to “substantially” increase the mine life at Kapan, he added. 
The Kapan mine generated more than $20m in earnings last year. Chaarat also has agreements to supply zinc to Swiss trader Trafigura and copper to Glencore from the mine. 
Analysts at Numis rate Chaarat a “buy” with a target price of 40p. Shares in the Aim-listed company have risen 25 per cent over the past year to trade at 27.15p. 
Petropavlovsk
Shares in Russian-focused miner Petropavlovsk have rallied by 27 per cent over the past month, a relief to investors following a year of boardroom upheaval. Its chairman Peter Hambro was ousted by shareholders last summer. 
Mr Hambro has returned to the company as president along with his co-founder Pavel Maslovskiy, who is chief executive. 
The miner said in January that it would increase its production of gold from 422,300 ounces in 2018 to between 450,000 and 500,000 ounces this year, helped by the completion of a pressure oxidation plant, which will allow it to recover more gold from its ore. 
Petropavlovsk has also restructured a guarantee it had provided on a loan from Chinese bank ICBC to Hong Kong-listed iron ore producer IRC, in which it holds a 31 per cent stake. IRC has entered into a new $240m loan with Gazprombank and Petropavlovsk has reduced its guarantee from $204m to $160m. 
Petropavlovsk’s largest shareholder, Kazakh businessman Kenges Rakishev, has said he wants the company to expand by buying two medium-sized gold mines in eastern Russia and looking at mines in Central Asia. 
“Now it is very logical to start M&amp;A,” Mr Rakishev said. “We want to do some diversification. Focusing only on Russia in this period is not so good. We need to have more safety.” 
Petropavlovsk’s stock is trading at 8.1p. Analysts expect earnings before interest, tax and other items (ebitda) to rise from $149.85m in 2018 to $157.62m this year and $227m in 2020, according to Refinitiv. 
“Bit by bit the Petropavlovsk team is ticking off the issues dominating its share price,” analysts at Peel Hunt said in January. 
Highland Gold
Highland Gold is another Russia-focused gold miner whose share price has recovered this year. The stock has surged 16 per cent over the past month to trade at 162.7p and has a dividend yield of 6.69 per cent. 
The miner said in January that it had produced 269,500 ounces of gold last year and was targeting between 290,000 and 300,000 ounces for this year, driven by a recent acquisition. 
In December Highland said it had received permission from Russia to acquire the Valunisty mine. The deal covers three companies with assets in the Chukotka region, where Highland already operates. 
Analysts at Numis rate the company a “buy” with a target price of 200p. It expects revenues of $313m for 2018, and ebitda of $157m."
126,BBC and Discovery to pool wildlife programming,Subscription service to cash in on popular natural history output,https://www.ft.com/content/84f1b704-2969-11e9-88a4-c32129756dd8,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-05T17:58:11Z,"The BBC and Discovery, the US media group, have struck a deal to pool their vast natural history and wildlife programming libraries in a new global subscription streaming service aimed at viewers from the Netflix generation that have embraced on-demand viewing. 
The project is part of a new partnership between the two broadcasters and comes as they prepare to divide the free-to-air and pay channels operated by UK TV, the broadcaster jointly owned by Discovery and BBC Studios, the BBC’s commercial arm. 
The wildlife streaming service will be owned by Discovery, with the BBC licensing its entire library of natural history programming, including those presented by David Attenborough which have been such a hit with viewers, such as Blue Planet and Dynasties.
The untitled service will not be available in the UK and China, but will be available in all other big international markets. It could be announced within weeks, according to several people briefed on the plans. BBC Studios and Discovery declined to comment.
The natural history service comes at an important juncture for the BBC. It has embraced digital streaming, with its iPlayer catch-up service winning 3.6bn requests for programming in 2018. The first episode of its autumn hit Bodyguard was streamed almost 11m times.
But it and other broadcasters are grappling with new competition from the likes of Netflix and Amazon. The publicly-funded BBC is also facing a possible financing crunch that could kick in if it decides to continue funding free television licenses for people over the age of 75. Responsibility for the scheme passes from the UK government to the BBC next year.
Discovery is one of the US’s largest media groups and has made a big push into streaming, developing new digital platforms aimed at particular sports and communities. Last year it struck a 12-year deal worth $2bn with the PGA Tour to create a “Netflix of golf” streaming service that would be available in every country outside the US. 
Programming from its Animal Planet network, Discovery Channel and Science Channel will be available alongside BBC natural history content on the streaming service, according to people briefed on the discussions. 
Tony Hall, the director-general of the BBC, recently told the Financial Times that streaming represented “the way people will consume the BBC in the future”, adding that the iPlayer was “no longer a catch-up service . . . it’s a destination”.
The BBC hopes to build on the success of iPlayer with a new streaming service for the UK market, which it is developing with ITV. The service will feature programming from both broadcasters.
The BBC is already a partner with ITV in BritBox, a US streaming service that features programming from both broadcasters — and which will form the basis for the new, UK subscription offering they are developing.
It is unclear who will run the new natural history streaming service, although two executives from the BBC and Discovery have been in the news recently after they both turned down the Premier League chief executive job. 
Tim Davie, the chief executive of BBC Studios, was offered the Premier League job last month but turned it down. That followed Susanna Dinnage, the chief executive of Discovery’s Animal Planet accepting the Premier League job before withdrawing from the position shortly afterwards."

Okta Inc.Nearly 10% of businesses now have more than 200 apps in their enterprise information-technology systems, the San Francisco-based identity-management firm said in a report Thursday. The report defines large firms as having more than 2,000 employees and small firms as having fewer than 2,000. It found smaller firms tended to have fewer apps, though the average number is also risingjumping from 53 in 2015, to 73 last year. That number could increase.
Global spending on enterprise software is expected to grow 8.5% this year to a total of $431 billion, driven by cloud-based software subscriptions, research firm
Gartner Inc.
said in a report last month. Overall spending on IT is expected to reach $3.8 trillion, up 3.2% from 2018, Gartner said.
The business worlds growing appetite for apps showcases the move over the last 10 years from single vendors with all-in-one platforms to best-of-breed applications, Todd McKinnon, Oktas chief executive officer, told CIO Journal. He describes the trend as positive, in that it reflects the widespread adoption of new, innovative technologies.
The analysis is based on login activity on Oktas network over the past year by more than 5,600 companies world-wide, as well as a survey of over 1,200 U.S. workers conducted between December and January. 
Okta provides a cloud-based tool that manages employee access and authentication for a companys stable of apps and other digital assets. To date, it has over 5 million paid daily active users and more than 100 million registered users, according to a company spokeswoman.
Still, there are costs associated with having more apps, including licenses and service fees, said Bill Swanton, a distinguished vice president and analyst at Gartner Inc.
He said many firms have multiple apps that essentially do the same thing, with workers in each business unit having their favorite tools. To curb costs, he said, many companies have implemented applications rationalization efforts to try to standardize apps across the business.
According to Okta,
Microsoft Corp.s
Office 365 last year was the most popular enterprise app, measured by the number of companies that have deployed ita title it has held since 2015.
Gauged by company deployments, other top apps included Googles G Suite, Box, Slack and applications offered by
Salesforce.com Inc.
and Amazon Web Services.
Security tools were the fastest-growing apps among Okta customers, with deployments of security-awareness training platform KnowBe4 growing 178% year over year, followed by LastPass and Proofpoint, Okta said.
Organizations are shifting the focus of modern security away from traditional network strategies to perimeter-less approaches, focusing on users, data, and locations, the report said.
And while many chief information officers strive to clean house by eliminating unnecessary clutter in IT systems, Mr. McKinnon said they are also encouraging employees to bring on new tools that can be secured and integrated into those systems.
They arent necessarily eliminating apps, theyre eliminating shadow IT, Mr. McKinnon said.
Not all apps being used in the workplace are related to the enterprise, the analysis found.
Just over half of the survey respondents said they have shopped online at work, while 6% admitted to checking dating apps in the office.

Volatility in the US equity market has retreated to its lowest level since early October as a pledge from the Federal Reserve to be patient with potential future interest rate rises and flexible with its balance sheet policy have soothed markets, writes Peter Wells.
The decline means the gauge has now retraced most of the jump from the December quarter when remarks by Fed chairman Jay Powell about a likely need for further rate rises triggered a violent stock market sell-off.
The Cboe’s volatility index, or Vix, was down 1.9 per cent at a reading of 15.83, which was its first time trading below 16 since December 3. At today’s session low of 15.78, the Vix reached its lowest since October 9.
Volatility in US Treasuries has also declined, with the Merrill Lynch Move index that tracks one-month T-bills, also trading around its lowest level since early October.

As for the world of big tech, Matthew Rocco writes that analysts at JPMorgan say that if Apple’s $245bn cash pile is burning a hole in its pocket, it could do worse than buy Netflix.
The investment bank speculated that Netflix, video-game developer Activision Blizzard and speaker maker Sonos are the best strategic fits should Apple seek large acquisitions to drive growth, particularly in its services business. 
JPMorgan analysts led by Samik Chatterjee wrote in a note to clients on Monday:
“While investors hardly seem to be complaining about the massive buyback pace, including ~$73bn last year, we believe they do hope the firm uses its balance sheet strength to insulate the business against often-seen disruptions in the technology landscape, some of which Apple itself has driven in the past.” 
Apple shocked Wall Street last month when it unveiled a rare downgrade to its guidance, saying revenue would fall short of its expectations as sales in China weakened and customers wait longer to upgrade their iPhones. Last week, the Cupertino, California-based tech giant reported $84.3bn in revenue for the quarter ending in December, down 5 per cent year-over-year. Sales in the current quarter are forecast to drop as much as 10 per cent. 
With many technology names trading below 52-week highs, Mr Chatterjee called it an “opportune time” for Apple to use its strong balance sheet to refocus on growth potential in services, a segment that includes Apple Music and the App Store, and whose sales jumped 19 per cent in the most recent quarter.

Copper shine — Citi has turned bullish on copper, saying it expects the metal to rally by 10 per cent over the next three to six months as President Donald Trump signs a trade deal with China and the global economy recovers, writes Henry Sanderson. 
The bank said it was “increasingly confident that the road signs for a macro recovery are being passed”, and the copper market will be short of supply. 
Citi’s forecast comes following a 15 per cent fall in the price of copper over the past year to $6,116 a tonne, driven by a slowdown in China’s economy. More here.

131,Target is taking its new loyalty program to more cities,"Target plans to take a revamped loyalty program that's been in somewhat of a stealth mode to five new markets on Feb. 19: Charlotte, North Carolina; Denver, Indianapolis, Kansas City and Phoenix.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/05/target-is-taking-its-new-loyalty-program-to-more-cities.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-05T12:00:00Z,"Target has a new loyalty program with personalized perks up its sleeve.
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
The discount retailer has plans to take a revamped loyalty program that's been in somewhat of a stealth mode in Dallas since March to five new markets on Feb. 19: Charlotte, North Carolina; Denver, Indianapolis, Kansas City and Phoenix.
The program is free to members and doesn't require a Target credit card to sign up. It offers perks like 1 percent back on all Target purchases to redeem later on, and will give out rewards on customers' birthdays something Target hasn't tried before but brands like Starbucks and Panera Bread have. The rewards will be customized based on shopping behavior, with Target determining if the recipient would be more likely to want clothes, a DVD or maybe more groceries.
Then there's a unique component: The loyalty program also lets shoppers choose which local nonprofits Target should donate toward. In the Dallas market, for example, Target said loyalty members have already directed $250,000 in donations to about 50 organizations.
""We wanted a program that was ... not just about collecting points to get savings,"" Chief Marketing Officer Rick Gomez said. ""We think this is a much bigger platform to build relationships with our guests.""
Other perks of Target's new program, called Target Circle, include free next-day delivery via its Restock service, where customers can place up to 45 pounds of everyday essentials like paper towels or shampoo in a box, and 50 percent off a one-year membership to Target's same-day delivery service Shipt.
Without taking them nationwide, Target has tested other loyalty programs, like Cartwheel Perks, which it ended in 2017, saying it was ""making adjustments"" based on customer feedback. Gomez said the company is still looking to perfect everything before integrating it into Target's main mobile app all across the U.S.
""I think this strategy is a way for us to grow,"" Gomez said, adding that the typical U.S. household has memberships to 29 loyalty programs, but fewer than half are ""active"" accounts. ""Americans love loyalty programs.""
As a retailer, it pays to have loyal customers. Literally.
Nearly 40 percent of customers who consider themselves ""loyal"" to a retailer say they will spend more on a product from their favorite store, even if it's cheaper somewhere else, according to a survey by Yotpo, which works with digitally native brands like Untuckit, Away, Adore Me and Chubbies to help with marketing and building their websites.
Then, 52 percent of loyal customers say they'd be willing to join some sort of rewards program, if they're presented with the option, Yotpo's survey of 2,000 U.S. shoppers over age of 18 found.
Other companies investing in or revamping their loyalty programs include Nordstrom, Macy's and Nike. Nordstrom's ""The Nordy Club,"" which launched last fall, gives members access to special clearance days, style events and beauty workshops, based on their annual spending.
""Brands can no longer settle for the typical loyalty program because Amazon Prime has upped the ante,"" Yotpo executive Raj Nijjer said. ""Companies have to take into account that the days of loyalty programs where 'one size fits all' and 'set it and forget it' are over.""
Not all retailers are going this route. Some of the biggest, like Walmart, don't offer rewards programs. Instead, Walmart hopes its low prices and massive store presence across the country will be enough to keep consumers coming back."

The Future is Asian. By Parag Khanna. Simon &amp; Schuster; 448 pages; $29.95. Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson; £20. 
Belt and Road: A Chinese World Order. By Bruno Maçães. Hurst; 224 pages; $29.95 and £20.
ASKED HOW he came to write The Lord of the Rings, J.R.R. Tolkien replied: I wisely started with a map and made the story fit. And so, says Bruno Maçães, when imagining new realities it is natural to begin the same way. These days a revised map of the world might have a radically different focus from previous onesbecause a vast, integrated Eurasian supercontinent is proving to be the salient feature of an emerging global order.
Once, when East was East and West was West, the chasm between them was not only geographical, but moral and historical too. Asia was a term invented by Europeans to emphasise their own distinctiveness; to Kipling-era imperialists, Asian societies were backward, despotic and unchanging. By contrast, Europe had made the decisive break to pursue a scientific approach to human affairswhich justified its dominion over other continents. Condescension was met with emulation: since Japans Meiji Restoration in 1868, Asias modernisation was long a matter of copying the West, either out of admiration for Europeans or to repel them or both. Asias economic transformations since the second world war were partly shaped by the needs of Western markets.
But now the modernisation that Europe first brought to Asia is racing back the other way. The Eurasian land mass is fizzing with new connections, thanks to fibre-optic cables, pipelines, roads, bridges and manufacturing zones linking East with West. Two years ago a freight train that began its journey in Yiwu in eastern China pulled into a depot in east London. The feat was largely symbolic. But nobody should doubt that Asia and Europe are being brought onto a common plane.
That process is the starting point of three stimulating new books, which make it clear that the map of world politics as it has been drawn for seven decades is no longer fit for purpose. From the old maps centre, as Mr Maçães describes it, the power of the United States radiated to the European and East Asian edges of Eurasia, acting as a kind of forward deployment against the dangers emanating from its inner corethat is, the communist challenges from Moscow and Beijing.
Today, the increasingly integrated nature of the Eurasian supercontinent that has emerged from the cold warall the glitzy cities springing up out of deserts, all those ports being built along Indo-Pacific coastsshould not be a surprise to students of capitalism and development. What many Western prognosticators got wrong, however, was assuming this world would be made in the Wests image; that it would embrace not just Western economics but also liberal political values, with their supposedly universal appeal and validity. You only have to look at the two biggest players by land mass, China and Russia, to see the folly of that presumption. Other illiberal powers, notably Turkey and Iran, are using past historical glories to conjure a resurgent future, projecting power along the new silk roads.
Economic integration seems not to be dissolving such differences in values, but heightening them. Nor is it clear that America and Europe can do much about it. Spreading democratic ideals is not a consistent priority for the United States; it increasingly wants to wield power from a distance. Western Europe is turning in on itself in partand here is the deep ironyas a response to crises sweeping in from Eurasia, among them waves of immigrants and Russias meddling both in Europes borderlands and its internal politics.
Mr Maçães, a Portuguese political scientist and former foreign minister, sketched some of his arguments in The Dawn of Eurasia (published last year). In Belt and Road he looks chiefly at Chinas part in reshaping the world. Until now, its signature foreign-policy project has been known in English as the Belt and Road Initiative. That final word already sounds too diminutive. Encompassing scores of countries and $1trn of real or promised infrastructure spending, the aim, first, is to create a new global economy with China at its heart. For all Chinas denials, the Belt and Road is also a major piece of geopolitical engineering. It reflects Chinas desire to shape its external environment rather than simply adapting to it; some worry that it is Chinas means to replace an American-led international order with its own. As a phrase, the Belt and Road may come to be used in the same, shorthand way as the West is today.
Start with the map, and the story follows. Yet there is no plan or plot, says Mr Maçães. President Xi Jinping and his acolytes are no Marxist determinists. Lenin is the better role model as they seize a fleeting chance to change the course of history.
And how. As Peter Frankopan, an Oxford historian, deliciously puts it in The New Silk Roads, when Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, last July unveiled Americas counter to the Belt and Road, the sum promised$113m in new programmeswas only somewhat more than the combined earnings of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. Just as Belt and Road augments Mr Maçãess earlier work, so The New Silk Roads updates Mr Frankopans magnificent history The Silk Roads (2015), which altered many readers views of where the worlds historical centre of gravity lay.
China is now repurposing an old tenet. The ancient concept of tianxia, or all under heaven, put China at the heart of power and civilisation. Moral precepts governed relations among states. There are echoes of that in Mr Xis notion of a Community of Shared Future for Mankind, and in the constant emphasis on win-win outcomes, mutual dependence and respect. Countries obligations depend on their place in a China-centred network.
The gratitude and dependency of others are convenient for China as it seeks to recycle its foreign-currency surplus, employ its workers on construction sites abroad, secure raw materials and fob off low-grade production onto others so that it may keep the best high-tech manufacturing and services at home. The Trump administration calls this approach debt-trap diplomacy. But that misses the appeal for many recipients of Chinese largesse. For a start, no one else is offering so much of it.
What is more, as Parag Khanna says in The Future is Asian, an upbeat examination of a changing Greater Asia, others welcome Chinas infrastructural forays because they provide cover to pursue their own commercial agendas. Nor does the fact of India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey jumping into an infrastructural arms race imply a zero-sum contest. Rather, says Mr Khanna, a Singapore-based geostrategist, China is thereby kick-starting the process by which Asians will come out from under its shadow.
Mr Khanna is too blithe about the drawbacks of authoritarianism. He imputes too much technocratic brilliance to the regions elites and glosses over the brutal dimensions of development, including Chinas high-tech repression against Uighurs. But on an important point, he agrees with Mr Maçães and Mr Frankopan: Eurasias future is likely to be more ductile than fixed and hegemonic. In this new world order, actions still lead to reactions. The increasing alignment of democratic Japan, Australia and India as a response to Chinese assertiveness is only one case in point.
Ineluctably, Eurasia is cohering, but that does not have to be under the stifling togetherness of tianxia. In their different ways, these books all serve as an antidote to American fears of a Manichaean contest with China. They give shape to latent forces that are already impossible to ignore.

133,"Tech stock that's up 40 percent this year is due for a pullback, says chart watcher",One cloud software stock is soaring above the rest so far this year. Its massive run has one trader wary of a possible pullback from here.,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/06/tech-stock-thats-up-40-percent-this-year-is-due-for-pullback-trader.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-06T17:30:00Z,"One cloud software stock is soaring above the rest so far this year.
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
Box shares have rallied 38 percent in 2019, well above the advances of less than 20 percent for Workday, Adobe and Salesforce.com.
Its massive run has one trader wary of a possible pullback from here.
""It's getting very overbought on a short-term basis,"" said Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, on CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Tuesday. ""The RSI chart at the bottom, it's up almost 50 percent in just five weeks. So my thinking is that you don't want to chase it up here, let it pull back a little bit.""
Box's recent gains have pushed its relative strength index close to 77, above the 70 threshold that generally delineates normal from overbought conditions.
However, on a longer-term basis, Maley says the cloud software stock should continue to perform well.
""It made a great double bottom back in the fourth quarter, and it bounced off its trend line going back to the 2016 lows,"" said Maley. ""It's rallied today above its 200-day moving average. ... The stock looks great on a long-term basis.""
Box popped back above its 200-day moving average on Tuesday after breaking below it back in October. It trades 4 percent above that long-term trendline.
From an options perspective, it looks as though some investors are cashing in on Box's solid start to the year, according to Stacey Gilbert, head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna. Options traders are dealing with the rest of the space on a case-by-case basis.
""If we take a step back and just look at the broader cloud space, it's actually quite mixed, and this is much more consistent with what we've seen in the market as a whole,"" Gilbert said on ""Trading Nation"" on Tuesday. ""It seems as if the market is taking a much more active approach to its investing; it's not as passive.""
If Gilbert were to pick one stock involved in cloud computing, she sees a clear winner.
""We definitely look towards Amazon for the cloud exposure relative to some of the other names,"" said Gilbert. ""We think it's a game changer over the next 10 years, plus you're getting two other big growth segments here within Amazon this is obviously going to be e-commerce and advertising.""
Amazon has risen 9 percent so far this year, around a quarter of Box's gains. Over the past 12 months, it has risen 14 percent, higher than Box's 13 percent increase."
134,Nissan workers fear for future of Sunderland plant,Japanese carmaker cancels production of X-Trail sport-utility vehicle,https://www.ft.com/content/afa14cf6-27cc-11e9-a5ab-ff8ef2b976c7,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-03T21:03:16Z,"When Nissan announced in 2016 that it would build two new models at its Sunderland plant, the factory lines came to a standstill as workers were told the good news.
But the cheers that echoed around Britain’s largest car facility have been silenced by the latest development — the cancelling of one of the cars by the Japanese group.
“People are starting to worry how long the plant is going to stay open,” said one production employee over the weekend, echoing the sentiments of many who work at the site.
For Nissan, the decision to cancel the X-Trail sport-utility vehicle does not immediately put the Sunderland plant, one of its largest outside of Japan, in peril.
The facility will still produce the new Qashqai, which accounts for more than half of the 450,000 vehicles made at the site annually, and has recently received significant upgrades to its paint shop and metal-pressing operation.
But the move raises questions over British car plants’ ability to win future work, as their largely international owners consider alternatives to UK manufacturing because of factors ranging from diesel’s decline to Brexit uncertainty.
Many carmakers — Honda, BMW, and Toyota as well as Nissan — have opted to build new models in the UK since the vote to leave the EU was held in the summer of 2016.
But as departure looms with politicians yet to agree a deal with the bloc, carmakers are coming to grips with the real possibility of an exit that could see them pay tariffs and face complex border checks, blowing a hole in the industry’s just-in-time supply chains and threatening the profitability of its facilities.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has warned that a “hard Brexit” will be “catastrophic” for the industry, leading to “death by a thousand cuts” as new work seeps overseas in the coming years.
“The risk of a no-deal Brexit will be felt deeply and widely across the sector,” said Ian Henry, a sector specialist who leads AutoAnalysis, a consultancy, and compiles the SMMT’s annual output forecast.
Colin Lawther, at the time Nissan’s head of European manufacturing, warned MPs in 2017 that the original decision to manufacture the X-Trail was under “constant review” if business conditions changed, also a consideration for many other carmakers, according to Mr Henry.
“In my view this will likely be followed by more decisions at other manufacturers,” Mr Henry said.
Even though Nissan’s dropping of the X-Trail was not wholly based on Brexit, it was a major factor.
This has left the local workforce looking for signs of confidence. Many of Nissan’s workers in Sunderland feel that the sheer size of the £4bn investment behind the plant offers some protection.
“They aren’t going to spend that money to let it fall by the wayside,” said one worker on Sunday.
This belief has been heightened by the start of work on the £400m International Advanced Manufacturing Park, a major site for component suppliers on land near the Nissan plant. 
A joint project between Sunderland City and South Tyneside councils, with UK government backing, about £100m of public money has been earmarked for the development.
The park, which the councils hope will eventually be home to more than 7,000 jobs, is in line with Theresa May’s pledge in 2016 to then head of Nissan, Carlos Ghosn, to help Nissan stay at Sunderland. 
Part of the government’s assurances, contained in a letter to Nissan in 2016, included a commitment to attract more supply chain businesses. This would help the company to buy more of its parts in sterling, protecting it from foreign exchange fluctuations and delays at the border.
“I can’t see them investing in that site if they aren’t 100 per cent [staying],” said one worker who, like others interviewed by the Financial Times asked that their name not be used. “The supply chain is massive.”
But for Nissan, a no-deal Brexit would also betray another key part of the government’s 2016 letter — the promise to try and secure the best trading deal possible with Europe following departure.
One advantage giving some solace to workers is that Nissan’s Sunderland site is the largest producer of electric vehicles in Europe, with the Leaf car and its own on-site battery facility, which will help maintain production in the area.
Industry figures and plant managers in the UK have long complained that the focus in British plants on surviving Brexit has prevented the British industry from making advances in electric technology, allowing other nations such as Germany to establish a lead.
Steve Bush at Unite union said: “The government’s mishandling of the transition away from diesel allied to the continuing uncertainty around our future trading relationship with the EU are extremely unhelpful when the sector ought to be focused on preparations for electrification”."
135,Germany pins hopes on consumers to drive growth,Slowdown in export machine and car industry has shifted focus to thrifty populace,https://www.ft.com/content/83bcc5c4-2570-11e9-8ce6-5db4543da632,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-03T22:00:26Z,"Shopping bag in hand and eyes trained firmly on the next store, Norbert and Beate Zimmer are doing their bit for the German economy. 
On a blustery winter day in Berlin, the couple have come to the East Side shopping mall in the eastern half of the capital to spend some cash. The result of their excursion so far is modest: just a few items of underwear from Uniqlo, the Japanese fashion store. The Zimmers said they felt safe in their jobs and confident about their future — but insisted they would remain prudent all the same. “We are not crazy shoppers,” said Ms Zimmer. “We don’t need to buy new stuff every weekend.” 
The thriftiness of Germany’s hard-saving, Aldi-loving consumers has long been the stuff of legend. This year, however, the economy needs them to loosen up. As the global economic outlook darkens, the German export machine sputters and important sectors such as the car industry face challenges on multiple fronts, the country is hoping that private consumers can pick up the slack. 
“The world economy is weakening and Germany suffers from that more than most other countries. That means that private consumption will be the driving force for growth this year,” said Timo Wollmershäuser, the head of business cycle analysis and forecasts at the Ifo institute in Munich. 
According to the latest government forecast, the German economy will grow by 1 per cent in 2019 — less than expected, and notably reduced from the 1.5 increase in gross domestic product in 2018. 
Private consumption, in contrast, was forecast to rise by 1.3 per cent this year, up from 1 per cent in 2018. That means that private consumption would contribute no less than 0.7 points to the overall 1 per cent growth rate — a much higher share than in previous years.
Analysts and the government agree that a German economic downturn was not on the horizon — thanks, above all else, to private consumption. As Carsten Brzeski, ING’s chief economist for Germany, put it, consumers have emerged as “the best recession-fighting instrument for the German economy”. 
German consumers have plenty of reasons to feel confident: unemployment is at a record low, salaries are rising and inflation continues to be relatively subdued. Purchasing power has been further boosted by a string of initiatives taken by the government of Angela Merkel last year, including pension and welfare increases and a cut to social contributions and taxes. 
“The government measures will push the economy at exactly the right moment,” argued Claus Michelsen, the head of forecasting and economic policy at the DIW institute in Berlin. 
Retailers agree with the generally upbeat assessment, but stress that Germans — for all their projected resilience — are not about to abandon their cautious ways. “The German consumer has a pretty realistic approach,” said Stefan Genth, the managing director of the HDE retail federation. “The consumption patterns are not comparable with those in the US, where people tend not to build up safety cushions and where money that is earned gets spent pretty quickly.” 
Germans save about 10 per cent of their disposable income in good times and in bad. The approach is revealed in official statistics but is also reflected among the patrons of the East Side shopping mall. Tino Gütte is one of several visitors who said he was looking but not buying. “You have to earn it before you spend it,” he said, as he headed for the mall’s exit without a single shopping bag. “And you should always keep some money back.” 
Hopes that consumers like the Zimmers and Mr Gütte would shed some of their reticence are not limited to Germany. European monetary policymakers are banking on consumers across the region to rescue a slowing economy. Mario Draghi, the eurozone's top central banker, said last month that a strong labour market and lower oil price would boost domestic demand, compensating for a global economic climate clouded by political uncertainty. 
“Wage growth continues to be significant and of course the lower energy prices support real disposable income for households,” Mr Draghi said. 
That upbeat outlook is shared by analysts such as Sylvain Broyer, chief economist for the Europe, Middle East and Africa region at S&amp;P, the rating agency. “European households will experience this year the largest increase in their payslips in real terms in three years.” He added that “social transfers” through benefit payments, especially in France and Italy, would further boost pay cheques. 
In Germany, the government expects net wages to rise by 4.8 per cent this year, leaving plenty of money in the pockets of a workforce that can now look back on a full decade of economic growth. But according to some observers, it is precisely that record that has kept consumption from taking off: Germans have simply had too many opportunities to fulfil their material desires in recent years. 
As Mr Genth pointed out, retail turnover, too, had been increasing for 10 solid years — the longest stretch of uninterrupted growth since the 1980s. “We are talking about a relatively saturated situation,” he said. “All of our wardrobes are full.”"
136,Have you been Zucked?,Platform tech firms are getting much more than they are giving,https://www.ft.com/content/cc0648e6-27c3-11e9-a5ab-ff8ef2b976c7,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-04T11:00:24Z,"There’s nothing better than a whistleblower’s tale, and Big Tech critic Roger McNamee has a whopper of one. His new book, Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe, is out tomorrow and in it, he lays out in detail how he tried unsuccessfully even before the 2016 presidential election (but also several times afterwards) to alert Facebook to how nefarious actors were misusing the platform to try and swing voter sentiment.
McNamee is a 20-year Silicon Valley veteran, a seed investor into Facebook, the man who advised Mark Zuckerberg to turn down Yahoo’s $1bn offer to buy the company early on (a great move given its current value), and the person who suggested that he hire Google ad whizz Sheryl Sandberg to be CFO of the company. Yet despite his insider status, Sheryl and Zuck gave him the same “deny and deflect” PR treatment that they’ve given pretty much everyone else over the past two years — move along, there’s nothing to see here.
The behaviour says quite a lot about the cognitive hubris of this company, and the rise of a generation of rather amoral leaders in Silicon Valley who are more libertarian than liberal. It also speaks to how much Facebook has to lose. As I explore in my column this week, there’s a new quest in both academic and policymaking circles to put a monetary value on data, and to make platform firms declare it just as they would any other asset. Over the past year, I’ve had conversations with any number of Washington folks who would like to see this happen, from Department of Justice antitrust Makan Delrahim, to SEC commissioner Rob Jackson, to a variety of legislators.

In his book, McNamee lays out some ideas about how companies are getting much more than they are giving, ideas that he hopes will be used to build antitrust cases against the Big Tech giants. As he told me in a recent conversation: “If you look at the arpu (average revenues per user) of a company like Facebook, it has roughly doubled year on year. Yet the service offerings to the user have not changed.” This is because platform tech firms surveil our movements across all the various apps and services they control and can build data profiles that have combinatorial value, which increases over time, as more and more information is harvested. Whilst each individual data point may not be extremely valuable, when put together, such data profiles have significant value for the company — and understanding that clearly would create more transparency for consumers, legislators and even investors in such firms.
Surveillance capitalism also has negative externalities that society needs to take into account — the traffic jams created by everyone using the same Waze app, or the much more serious consequences of election manipulation. When I first met McNamee, roughly two years ago, he was reluctant to admit that anti-monopoly action might be needed to get these firms to change their ways. Now, that’s his own prescribed remedy (indeed, he believes it’s exactly what’s needed to unleash the next wave of technology innovation, pointing to how the break-up of AT&amp;T created the cell phone industry, and the US government’s antitrust suit against Microsoft allowed for the birth of Google). “We need to start being a lot more intellectually curious” about how Facebook and other big platform firms really work, he says. I suspect that in the year ahead, lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic will be. Ed, do you think antitrust will be a litmus test for the Democratic 2020 candidates?

Edward Luce responds
Rana, you’ve taught me two new phrases — arpu, which I’m unlikely to use again, and surveillance capitalism, which I am. That said, I don’t think there’s as much popular juice in the latter as you might expect. It’s striking that Warren has not emphasised trustbusting and regulation of Big Tech in the early weeks of her campaign. A year ago I would’ve expected her to. But it seems to have tapered off for the time being. Unless voters feel direct harm from the likes of Facebook, the theme is unlikely to become a litmus test for candidates. The only area that really inflames people is to do with fake news, and only then to the extent Trump is believed to have benefited from Russian interference. But that’s about impeachment, rather than regulation. Much as I hate to say it, most consumers don’t yet feel the threat of surveillance capitalism.

137,Interserve needs to avoid government’s ‘no-deal’ Brexit mindset,Time is running out but signs are emerging that deadlock for outsourcer may be broken,https://www.ft.com/content/650b3eb4-295b-11e9-a5ab-ff8ef2b976c7,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-05T21:10:17Z,"No one wants a ‘no-deal’ outcome. Negotiators are locked in talks, trying to reach a compromise. But the government is sticking to its ‘red lines’ — vetoing a possible solution. And time is running out. No, it is not Brexit (for once). It is how the future of British outsourcer Interserve had been looking. 
Back in December, it seemed a deal had been struck to save the heavily indebted government contractor. Interserve said its lenders were “fully supportive” of a plan to convert its debt to equity, bringing its net debt down to less than 1.5 times earnings by the end of this year. At the same time, new equity was to be offered to new and existing shareholders through a public offering. Reports suggested £300m of the group’s £800m net debt pile would be converted into shares and its £250m building materials unit, RMD Kwikform, spun-off to lenders to help cut their losses.
But, on Tuesday, people involved in the talks told the Financial Times that the Cabinet Office had blocked that deal because separating RMD Kwikform would leave the remaining contracting business too weak to be awarded government projects. Analysts noted that RMD contributes £50m-£60m of Interserve’s £90m operating profit. 
Some of Interserve’s lenders might have ended up with the RMD assets anyway. A note in its last annual report said: “The group has granted security in respect of the new, and some of the existing debt, in the form of share pledges over material subsidiaries and floating charges over various intercompany funding arrangements.” However, that could have made it harder for the other lenders to sign up to a revised, no-spin-off plan — leaving Interserve hurtling towards “no deal” with time running out on its banking facilities.
As with Brexit, the main parties only seem to know what they do not want. 
Lenders — judging by their attempted RMD spin-off — did not want to end up owning a construction and support services contractor. They, more than anyone, knew how bad cash flow has been for these businesses. Even if they tried to sell off Interserve’s best contracts while running others down, they might have recouped little. Serco’s cut-price deal for Carillion assets showed how much this is a buyer’s market. Persuading all of Interserve’s lenders to enter this market as equity owners — which is necessary for a deal — looked like it might prove too difficult.
Equity investors — judging by recent fundraisings — did not want to be in this business, either. Contractors G4S and Serco may have managed to raise £350m and £550m, respectively, in rights issues four years ago, to pay down debt. But Capita’s £700m rights issue last year unnerved some investors and only 38 per cent of shareholders supported Kier’s £250m fundraising in December. Persuading new and existing investors to buy more Interserve shares therefore, did not look likely.
Thankfully, there are now signs this Brexit-style deadlock may be broken. It needs to be, otherwise Interserve faces its own ‘no-deal’ exit: being delisted from the market, at the hands of lenders or administrators. 
Mifid: not the last post
Brokers continue to trumpet at the destabilising effects of Mifid II as loudly as Gideon’s army, writes Kate Burgess. But to less effect. 
The EU directive forces brokers to split out the cost of their research to clients. It is uncomfortable for small firms. Since Mifid was introduced a year ago, big suppliers of research have cut their charges to hold on to market share. Now, investors are reducing what they will pay for the research they want — and axing the guff they don’t.
On Monday, Peel Hunt, alongside the Quoted Companies Alliance, warned that specialist brokers would become more generalist, research quality would fall, gaps would appear in the coverage of small companies and trading in their shares would turn sclerotic. Then, on Tuesday, Numis said deal volumes were down 25 per cent in the last quarter. However, the broker said this was less to do with Mifid than Brexit, economic uncertainty and a slowdown in corporate activity. 
That chimes with London Business School dons who said in January there had been little evidence yet that Mifid II had made an impact on small-cap liquidity or research. Trading in market minnows has been decreasing as a percentage of total volumes for years. And the average number of analysts per small company increased from two to six between 2002 and 2018, dipping only a fraction last year. That suggests companies have been over-researched and a correction was due. It also suggests brokers could struggle to find their feet until stock market conditions settle. Mifid is just one factor in the global disequilibrium.

The tool will be based on Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform, which it describes as a secure end-to-end platform that organizations can use to store and analyze sensitive data.
“Healthcare leaders are thinking about how they bring their data into the cloud while increasing opportunities to use and learn from that data,” Microsoft wrote in a blog.
With its new healthcare push, Microsoft aims to create a system that makes health records more easily accessible and sharable between clinicians, researchers, and patients, Bloomberg reports. The corporation also sees its integrated healthcare storage as a way to attract companies to Microsoft, over its competitor Amazon Web Services.
Both Microsoft and Amazon faced backlash over contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to provide the agency with cloud storage for biometric information.
Microsoft will not only provide healthcare organizations with an accessible storage and information sharing platform, but the company is also making its healthcare bots available to more healthcare organizations. The Microsoft Healthcare Bot service will include chatbots, and features like medical content and terminology and a built-in symptom tracker, the company announced Thursday.
The bots will also help patients find clinical trials for new drugs and therapies, or answer questions about their prescriptions, according to Bloomberg."
140,UK broadcasters/Netflix: shriek show,US streaming giant’s success is frighteningly real,https://www.ft.com/content/48cc5458-2885-11e9-a5ab-ff8ef2b976c7,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-04T16:00:00Z,"Netflix has started to excel at horror. Post-apocalyptic thriller Bird Box was a smash hit. Increasingly, the business model of the US streaming giant is also terrifying broadcasters. 
Netflix is revving up its production of local content. In Britain, it is trying to compete with local broadcasters, says research group Enders Analysis. One reason is that the UK is Netflix’s most valuable market outside the US. Another is that it makes sense to spend on British content, given worldwide appetite for costume dramas and the likes of Planet Earth. Netflix was able to spend almost $8bn globally on content last year, significantly more than the non-sport budget of UK broadcasters. By 2022, Netflix, Amazon, Facebook and Apple could together be outspending them by a factor of four.
The BBC says there is no evidence that viewers are deserting it in favour of services such as Netflix. But licence fee cancellations rose for the first time in five years last year. The growth of streaming services underlines the challenge of defending the £150.50 licence fee in its current form. ITV is also threatened by changes in viewing habits, particularly of young people. Although the World Cup and Love Island helped it attract more viewers in 2018, its business faces disruption. Its share price has fallen by a fifth in the past six months, more than twice the decline of the FTSE 100.
UK broadcasters are responding by drawing up plans for a joint streaming service. Subscribers will get access to archives and some dramas. Foreign groups are floating similar proposals. Discovery, the US group that owns Eurosport is joining forces with ProSiebenSat. 1, for example. More dramatically, Walt Disney and AT&amp;T are both launching their own streaming services this year in a challenge to Netflix’s dominance. 
But there are difficult trade-offs. Netflix is a valuable source of revenue to the broadcasters. They are unlikely to stop licensing their content. Doing so would cut off a much-needed source of income. That could give the deep-pocketed tech giants the edge. If so, the broadcasters’ feared plotline is likely to unfold.

On one, he can monitor the most popular stories in the Russian language. Another display shows how content is being shared via social media, while a third tracks trending online news about several countries including neighbouring Belarus. 
“I believe in the 21st century we have to be ready not only to fight in kinetic wars, but in information wars, too,” says Sgt Ceponis, whose work at the Lithuanian army’s strategic communications department makes him part of an unusual military-civilian network in Lithuania to police alleged “fake news”. “We think if you can connect intelligence guys with psychological operations guys, it’s probably the best.”
Lithuania sees itself as being on the frontline of a Russian offensive to sow misinformation in the western world. European politicians have become increasingly spooked by the spread of conspiracy theories, such as recent stories that President Emmanuel Macron planned to hand the French regions of Alsace and Lorraine to neighbouring Germany. That follows claims of Kremlin-backed meddling in the 2016 US presidential poll and the UK’s Brexit referendum the same year, as well as the row over the poisoning in the UK of Sergei Skripal, the former spy — in which the two men accused by London claimed on Russian television that they were tourists.

“People realised, ‘Holy shit, this is like something out of a cold war thriller,” says an EU official from another formerly Soviet-occupied state about the Skripal incident. “The Russians have weaponised disinformation. It’s another side of the same coin as brining the Ukraine electricity grid to a halt.”
For the EU, one of the biggest sources of dread is the potential for such manipulation to play a role in the European parliamentary elections due in May. These elections have taken on greater importance this year because of the rise of far-right and anti-establishment parties — many with a pro-Russian bent — challenging the status quo across the continent. 
They are also uniquely vulnerable to outside interference. A combination of low turnout and protest voting means successful propaganda campaigns could reap high returns as small groups of motivated voters can have a major influence on the results. 
Lithuania, like other neighbours shaped by Soviet-era Communist domination, has long pushed for a tough approach to disinformation both at home and at an EU level. Vilnius’ strategy is notable for the way it relies on close co-operation between groups in society — such as the media and the military — which in other respects have a more adversarial relationship. 
“Ten years ago there was no way to discuss these issues at all, because [EU] colleagues thought ‘it is not our business, it’s freedom of speech and that’s it’,” says Linas Linkevicius, Lithuania’s foreign minister. “It took time to convince them that lies are not freedom of speech.”
The question is how much the experiences of this country of fewer than 3m people, formed by a very particular history with Russia, could — or should — be scaled up to a multilingual bloc of hundreds of millions, especially given the risk that opponents could brand government anti-disinformation work as censorship.

So far, European efforts to guard against misinformation have been modest. They have also been dogged by legitimate concerns over how much state authorities should be involved in defining, still less tackling, the wide range of outright factual falsehoods and contested narratives often grouped under the unhelpful shorthand of fake news. The idea of involving institutions such as the military in combating disinformation — as Sgt Ceponis is doing in Lithuania — causes deep anxiety in parts of the EU.
“There is a cultural issue here,” says one diplomat from a western EU state. “Do you come in really heavily and slam down the full weight of the state to expose this? Or do you expect that this is part of having a free media space?”
Drive for transparency
The EU’s desire to fight back against disinformation has increased as more and more member states have experienced problems. In one case in 2016, Germany saw a barrage of claims by Russian media and politicians that foreign immigrants had abducted and raped a 13-year-old ethnic Russian girl named “Lisa” in Berlin. The authorities were criticised for being slow to discredit the story, though defenders of the German handling of the case say the need to check facts and preserve “Lisa’s” privacy made it hard to move quickly and decisively. In Spain, the government has accused Russia of spreading disinformation in an effort to deepen the crisis that erupted in 2017 over Catalan secession (Moscow has denied the claim). 
In December, EU leaders branded the spread of “deliberate, large-scale, and systematic disinformation”, including as part of hybrid warfare, an “acute and strategic challenge for our democratic systems”. They called for an “urgent response that needs to be sustained over time” including to safeguard the integrity of the European elections.
The EU response ranges from investing more in debunking false information to pressing social media companies to do more to curb their circulation. In late January, the European Commission said Facebook and others businesses needed to hire more independent fact-checkers and take down more fake accounts. Facebook announced that ahead of the European elections it would create a public database to show who was paying for politically driven advertisements and how often they were viewed.
Julian King, the EU’s security commissioner, stresses that Brussels wants to see more action on disinformation but has no plans to be a “fake news” referee. “We are not saying whether particular pieces of information are true or false, or good or bad,” he says. “What we are trying to do is find way of increasing transparency and provenance so an audience has a way of contextualising the information they are given.”

Some officials in Vilnius and other central and eastern European capitals view the problem in starker terms. They see a landscape of ever-growing propaganda, including in Lithuania’s case via television stations that broadcast heavily in Russian. 
One government official says she can watch Russian language programmes on as many as 10 TV stations, which often buy Russian content because it is cheaper than EU programming and can be shown without translation. She says the output mixes “really nice to watch” shows on fashion and science with programmes that extol the supposed benefits of Russian imperialism and chip away at the growing weaknesses in the west. “They are using issues like Brexit and the tensions in the US as examples of really bad things happening in the west — like the west can’t manage itself,” the official says. 
Lithuania has growing legal means to tackle alleged sources of disinformation — although officials insist these are aimed at stopping blatant factual fabrications and standardising broadcast rules, rather than stifling legitimate debate. Authorities can order electronic communications providers such as servers to shut down for 48 hours without a court order if they are used to mount a “cyberincident”, such as a disinformation attack. 
Edvinas Kerza, vice-minister of national defence, says a strong approach is needed because of what he says is a broad pro-Kremlin information assault. He points to how information attacks are being integrated with cyber attacks, including a case last year in which hackers used a breach of a TV station to publish a false story about the defence minister and then publicise the article in an emailed press release embedded with malicious code. “They put next-generation software in a Word document,” Mr Kerza says. “Everything seems to be so real — it’s even sent from a news portal’s email server.”
‘It was time to do something’
Another striking point about Lithuania’s counter-disinformation campaign is how far it stretches into wider society. The best known examples of that are the so-called “elves” — volunteers who set out to combat Russian trolls. Their constantly shifting membership numbers in the thousands and includes journalists, IT professionals, business people, students and scientists.
“It’s a movement, not an organisation,” says one elf, an ecommerce manager who uses the name Hawk because he fears being targeted if he uses his real name. “There was an understanding that it was time to do something, not just sit on the sofa and watch TV.”
Lithuania's military monitor alleged fake news
In a coffee shop in Vilnius, Hawk describes how the elven ideal is to expose and combat false claims and contested narratives as fast as possible. There are different types of elves — some are debunkers of false information, others run “blame and shame” online campaigns against pro-Kremlin trolls. He says his adversaries have become smarter, focusing more and more on “finding the weak points in Lithuanian society” — sometimes chiming in on both sides of an issue to stoke controversy. “In Lithuania we work in one direction, even the media which are competitors,” he says. “When we need to defend our country against propaganda and fake news, we are united.”
Another innovation is the website Demaskuok.lt — also known as Debunk.eu — created by a collaboration of the military, journalists and civil society. It has been funded by Google Digital Innovation Fund and the Baltic media outlet Delfi. It scans an estimated 20,000 articles a day from more than 1,000 sources against a database of trigger words and narratives, including that Lithuania is a failed state or is being reoccupied by Nato. Flagged content is then physically reviewed for potential further action, which could include aggressive debunking. 
Vaidas Saldziunas, Delfi’s defence editor, scrolls through example stories tackled by the site. These include false reports that a Nato vehicle knocked a boy of his bike and killed him, tales of biological weapons tests in the Baltic states, and claims of a UFO being shot down over Lithuania. “A lot of people don’t really read beyond the headlines,” he says. One group of hackers managed to smuggle a false story of a Nato plan to invade neighbouring Belarus into a news organisation’s feed for a week. 
The site already works in Lithuanian and Russian and is expanding into English — and perhaps other EU languages. Mr Saldziunas plays down concerns about conflicts of interest as journalists collaborate closely with institutions they report on in other spheres. “We can write a critical story about the military — and still have co-operation with the military,” he says. “This is the topic that everybody drops everything for.” 
However, this level of co-ordination makes some fellow EU states uneasy. Countries such as the Netherlands have historically been suspicious that government involvement in anti-disinformation might compromise media independence and freedom. “We have to be careful,” says a diplomat from another western European country. “You can’t translate one solution the Baltic states have found to other situations. You can’t have one size fits all.”
Coming round to the Vilnius view
Some critics see the focus on disinformation as a way to avoid dealing with the political reasons for the rise of anti-establishment parties. The extent of influence of Russian propaganda is inherently unknowable, which makes it a convenient bogeyman and can allow EU politicians to avoid responsibility for their own political mistakes. The idea of aggressive rebuttals of pro-Kremlin narratives is also contentious if it involves governments appearing to take sides on the way the media talks about contested versions of history. 
The EU is also an unwieldy institution to tackle disinformation. It does not have its own intelligence service. It has beefed up its East Stratcom task force, whose EUvsDisinfo debunking site received more than 600,000 visits last year, but the operation still only has 16 people. EU diplomats say the site has received extra resources to “further professionalise” it after it was forced last year to retract three inaccurate accusations of disinformation against Dutch news media, in a case that spawned outrage in the Netherlands. It emerged that one piece was mistranslated by non-Dutch speakers at a Ukrainian NGO, while another was satire that the complainant mistakenly took at face value.
The journalist Vaidas Saldziunas
Another EU initiative — for a pan-bloc “early warning” channel for member states to raise the alarm about emerging disinformation threats — is still at an early stage. 
But its creation is a sign of fear about disinformation has pushed the balance of views in the bloc closer to Lithuania’s outlook — especially as the European elections approach. Sgt Ceponis says he sees the country’s growing anti-disinformation architecture as a “temporary measure to solve a specific problem”, but warns that he does not think it will be solved any time soon. “We are living in this information conflict time,” he says. “So we should not pretend this is not happening.”"
142,Insurers seek comfort in catastrophe bonds,"AIG, Axa and Allianz among groups to tap boom that threatens to reshape sector’s model",https://www.ft.com/content/88663f92-2647-11e9-8ce6-5db4543da632,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-05T05:00:31Z,"The world’s biggest insurers are piling into a previously niche area of fund management as low interest rates upend their business models, in a trend that could fundamentally change the way they make money. 
AIG, Axa and Allianz are among groups to set up or buy companies that manage the huge amount of capital that has been pouring into specialist insurance over the past five years. 
The insurers have started managing funds of catastrophe bonds and other insurance-linked securities. These instruments, in which investors directly take on insurance risk in return for a premium, compete with traditional insurance and reinsurance companies. 
The market has boomed as sustained low interest rates force investors to cast their nets far and wide in search of higher returns. According to Willis Towers Watson, there was $93bn in ILS at the end of 2018, up from just $18bn in 2009. 
Brian Schneider, senior director at Fitch Ratings, said there may be a temporary pullback this year as investors digest losses caused by natural disasters over the past two years, but that will not change the long-term trend. 
“It is going to continue to grow late this year and next year,” he said. “There is a lot of capacity willing to jump in.”
Much of this money has traditionally been managed by independent specialists such as Bermuda-based Nephila Capital, which has $12bn under management. 
But big insurers are getting in on the action. AIG’s $5.6bn purchase of Validus a year ago, which controlled ILS manager AlphaCat, was followed last March by Axa’s $15bn acquisition of XL Group. Nephila was swallowed up by Markel of the US in August.
Allianz last month became the latest to make a move, announcing a tie-up with subsidiary Pimco to launch an ILS business.
“It could be a big sign of the future for insurance and reinsurance companies,” said Mr Schneider. “It took time for [insurance] companies to get into this, but they are looking at it heavily right now.”
This trend in property and casualty insurance echoes one under way in the life insurance world for a decade. There, insurance companies are slowly shifting from taking risk on to their own balance sheets — for example by providing investment guarantees — to simply managing money and leaving the clients to deal with the risks. 
The new breed of products and services require less upfront capital from the insurers, and offer a stream of regular fee income. 
One of the big attractions for insurers is that owning an ILS manager can enable them to sell more insurance to customers by providing an additional source of capital.
“We have been looking at another source of capital to supplement traditional capacity to support the insurance risk that we take around the world,” said Amer Ahmed, chief executive of Allianz Re. “There is a lot of risk around the globe that is not protected . . . here are limitations to our risk appetite so we need other forms of capital.” 
It is not only a desire for more business that is behind insurers’ shift into ILS fund management. The influx of capital into ILS has pushed prices for insurance and reinsurance down, taking profits with them. 
The ILS investor doesn’t want to feel that they are getting risk which is underpriced or volatile over the long term. The transparency of what risk is being ceded is important
Stefan Holzberger, chief rating officer at AM Best
Some insurers have had to cut whole lines of business where returns no longer meet their cost of capital. Moving into ILS management allows them to create a new income stream, even if prices remain low. 
“Senior management at insurance companies are looking at hurdle rates and their own cost of capital,” said Stefan Holzberger, chief rating officer at rating agency AM Best. “They don’t want to leave the market. They want to provide cover but they want to limit their exposure.”
Gérald Harlin, chief financial officer of Axa, said the ILS market offered the insurer a different business model. “It is like the originate to distribute model in asset management. It’s a fee business — it’s structuring risk.”
The strategy is not without risks. As banks found to their cost during the financial crisis, arranging loans on which someone else takes on the risk can bring reputational damage if the debt turns sour. 
“The ILS investor doesn’t want to feel that they are getting risk which is underpriced or volatile over the long term,” said Mr Holzberger. “The transparency of what risk is being ceded is important.”
These risks can go very wrong. Investors in a $200m catastrophe bond covering wildfire risks issued last summer by Californian power supplier PG&amp;E are facing a total loss after the US state was struck by its worst ever blaze in November. 
Allianz plans to keep an interest in all the risks it arranges for its ILS funds. 
“We would not be just pure transformers as you may have seen in other securitisation models,” Mr Ahmed said. “We would not want even the perception that we are putting clients into risks that we would not take.”"

div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
It was clear heading into the holiday season that the toy industry was going to take a hit. The bankruptcy and subsequent closure of Toys R Us meant Hasbro, Mattel and other toymakers had far fewer shelves on which to place their inventory than in years prior.
While a number of retailers, including Target, Walmart, and even drugstores, expanded their toy sections this past holiday season, it wasn't enough to offset the hole left by Toys R Us' departure from the market.
Industry-wide sales of toys fell 2 percent in 2018, according market researcher NPD Group.
Investors rallied behind Mattel on Thursday after the company exceeded analyst expectations during the fourth quarter. Shares spiked as much as 27 percent on Friday, before retreating slightly. The stock is down nearly 6 percent over the past year putting its market value at $4.3 billion. Analysts expressed renewed confidence in the company, which has been in the midst of a multi-year turnaround.
""Mattel's Q4 results were materially better relative to expectations, in our opinion, and hence we came away from this update incrementally more upbeat on business fundamentals,"" Drew Crum, analyst at Stifel, wrote in a research note Thursday.
Investors and analysts were less confident about Hasbro, however. The company posted weaker-than-expected profits and continued to blame Toys R Us for its sales woes.
""We are surprised with the severity of the miss, but take some solace that retail inventory levels have significantly declined, which should allow Hasbro to start 2019 with a relatively clean channel and a more efficient cost structure,"" Eric Handler, analyst at MKM Partners, wrote in a research note Friday.
Hasbro shares were down 4.9 percent Friday after falling as much as 10 percent before the opening bell. Hasbro's stock is down nearly 11 percent over the past year, bringing its market value to $11.4 billion.
""If you took the logo off the top, Hasbro's earnings read like a company that was restructuring and Mattel read like a growth company,"" Gerrick Johnson, analyst at BMO Captial Markets, said."

145,US Q1 earnings tipped for first decline in 3 years,Analysts slash their year-on-year forecasts as companies succumb to pressure on margins,https://www.ft.com/content/2e9e148a-27f0-11e9-a5ab-ff8ef2b976c7,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-04T05:00:26Z,"Wall Street analysts have slashed their estimates for US corporate earnings in the first quarter and now expect the first year-on-year decline in almost three years.
Consensus estimates point to a 0.8 per cent drop in earnings per share this quarter, according to FactSet, a dramatic markdown from a forecast of 3.3 per cent growth at the end of December. If expectations prove true, it would be the first such contraction since the second quarter of 2016.
Concerns about earnings growth in 2019 surfaced last year and the outlook has continued to darken as the reporting season for the fourth quarter progressed. 
With about half of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 having reported their results, earnings for the fourth quarter rose 12.4 per cent overall. But corporate tax cuts boosted profitability last year, setting up less flattering comparisons for 2019. What is more, the US has endured brutal cold snaps of late and companies have had to contend with the uncertainty of the longest government shutdown in US history.
Still, the pressure was seen more on margins than top-line growth, forecasts showed.
Margin deterioration is going to be a big theme this year
Max Gokhman
The drop in earnings forecasts came alongside a more modest decline in expected revenues for S&amp;P 500 companies. Analysts were expecting top-line growth of 5.7 per cent this quarter versus 6.5 per cent as of December 31.
“Margin deterioration is going to be a big theme this year,” said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors. “What is driving that deterioration is higher labour costs and the friction created by the trade war, which disrupts supply chains.”
Various sectors of the S&amp;P 500 were facing risks including commodity prices and the slowdown in China.
DowDupont, the chemicals group, was one of the companies warning about a margin squeeze. 
Howard Ungerleider, chief financial officer, said the company expected its petrochemicals and plastic division, set to be spun off by April 1 as a new Dow, would report operating earnings down more than 20 per cent in the first quarter, hit by a decline in margins that started last year and has continued into 2019. 
Meantime, energy companies led the decline in earnings estimates for the first quarter as a slide in oil prices late last year cast the 2019 outlook in doubt. Analysts were predicting a nearly 6 per cent drop in first quarter EPS for energy companies versus expectations of an increase of 16.5 per cent at the end of 2018.
John Hess, chief executive of the exploration and production company Hess, told analysts on a call last week that “all we’re doing now is trying to manage uncertainty” following the fall in oil prices in the past four months.
Brent crude has dropped from more than $86 a barrel in early October to just under $63 at the end of last week.
Forecasts for the tech sector, home to Apple and chipmakers, went from a 2.2 per cent decline in profitability to an 8.9 per cent drop.
Some high-profile tech companies have also raised the red flag on sales. 
Apple shocked investors in January by warning that a downturn in Chinese consumer spending and slower pace of iPhone upgrades globally meant the company would miss its own sales estimate last quarter for the first time in more than 15 years. Guidance for the current quarter was below the Wall Street consensus.
Amazon raised worries with a cautious first-quarter sales forecast that came in below Wall Street estimates because of regulatory changes in India that forced the retailer to pull products from its site there. The company said it also expected to ramp up spending in 2019, which could eat into margins.
Even as analysts dialled back their profit forecasts last month, investors bid up stocks by 7.9 per cent in January, the best start to the year since 1987. Investors have pointed to a dovish outlook from the Federal Reserve and rebound from oversold conditions in December as reasons for the rise.
“The market is trading on the hope that this is a temporary issue and that we start to see some growth in the second quarter and that the back half of the year should be a whole lot better,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek.
Wall Street analysts were calling for quarterly earnings growth of 1.6 per cent, 2.7 per cent and 9.9 per cent, respectively, for the rest of the year.

Shares rose just over 34 percent in January the largest monthly gain in the company's 127-year history. January's jump was in large part due to the company's fourth-quarter revenue beat, boosted by strong performance from the aviation business.
But January's performance notwithstanding, it hasn't exactly been smooth sailing for the company, to put it mildly. The stock is down 64 percent in three years, after getting hit hard by struggles in the power segment and GE Capital, as well as a lack of investor confidence in the company's management team. In 2018 alone, the company lost almost $90 billion in market value.
As the Street watched the stock tick lower, investors began to ask just how far the stock needed to fall before it would be a buy.
That point may have finally been reached.
With the stock off its lows but miles from its high, and a new management team in place that's provided clarity on a turnaround plan, Point View Wealth Management strategist John Petrides and Newton Advisors technician Mark Newton say now could be the time to buy shares of GE.
""If you're looking at the next six months, GE's going to have to do a lot fundamentally to convince investors but if you're looking out 12 months to 18 months I think the worst is in,"" Petrides said Friday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""
Lawrence Culp took over as chairman and CEO in October following John Flannery's short-lived tenure at GE's helm. Petrides views this as a key positive catalyst that could unlock value in the stock.
""The ball is now in Larry Culp's hands to turn the company around from a fundamental standpoint. I mean GE had a fundamentally broken story with a black box for a balance sheet. That's not a good look for the stock. And what we got out of this past earnings call was that the black box balance sheet is hopefully behind us because there are no more write-offs in GE Capital. So now the faith goes into Culp's hands to be able to turn the company around,"" he said.
Like Petrides, Newton believes the stock could be a long-term buy. But in the near term, he advises caution since he thinks it's still in a sharp downtrend.
""Near term I still see the potential for a bit more on the upside, but I think that's going to be capped out near $12 You know unfortunately GE still has a very strongly negative momentum on a weekly and monthly basis,"" he said.
For now, he argues that traders should sell the pops and buy the drops.
GE sank to a nine-year low of of $6.66 on Dec. 11, a move that Newton called ""monumental"" since it was almost exactly where the stock ""bottomed out in 2009, within a few ticks."" While the stock has bounced off that low, he doesn't see a significant positive base building. In Monday's premarket, it was at $10.26.
""Technically speaking it's still very much in a downtrend, so you use a first rally to sell into and you look to buy dips,"" he said."
148,How to preserve nature on a tight budget,Saving species cheaply and effectively,https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2019/02/09/how-to-preserve-nature-on-a-tight-budget,"{'id': 'the-economist', 'name': 'The Economist'}",2019-02-07T15:58:36Z,"THE NORTHERN spotted owl, pictured above, is a handsome creature. Dark brown and, as the name implies, dappled with white flecks, it stands up to half a metre tall when perched on branches in the ancient forests of Americas north-west. Its swivel neck lets it scan its sylvan habitat for woodrats, flying squirrels and other preyor, rather, to scan what is left of that habitat, after decades of heavy logging. This logging has caused the owls numbers to decline steadily. Fewer than 2,500 pairs remain, mainly in Oregon, northern California and Washington. As a result, the spotted owl is listed under Americas Endangered Species Act.

Listing means money. Efforts directed at preserving spotted owls receive $4.4m a year, through various channels, from American taxpayers. This sum is almost double what the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), a federal agency, recommends be spent on the species. Nor is the owl the only over-endowed threatened organism in America. In 2016 Leah Gerber of Arizona State University found that 139 of the 1,124 plants and animals with federal recovery plans in place got more than their fair share of public resources, as defined by USFWS recommendations. The surplus totalled $150m a year, more than a quarter of spending in the area. Re-allocated, this could bring nearly 900 currently underfunded plans up to budget.
Conservation then, as is true of so many other things in life, is not fair. People have favourites, even within the official listsand those favourites receive special treatment. Spotted owls get money. Scaleshell mussels, pictured overleaf, do not. Yet according to the Nature Conservancy, a big American charity, about 70% of North American mussel species are extinct or imperilled. That compares with 15% of birds.
Some of this favouritism may not matter (though freshwater mussels are important parts of their local ecosystems and were, until recent decades, so abundant that entire industries, such as buttonmaking, depended on them). But with extinction rates estimated as being between 100 and 1,000 times their pre-human level, and man-made climate change reshaping even those parts of Earths surface that humanity has yet to trample under foot, ship or fishing net, a rational approach to conservation would be welcome.
The instinctive response of many conservationists to the sprawl of Homo sapiens across Earths surface is to fence off sprawl-free areas as rapidly and extensively as possible. That thought certainly dominates discussions of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, the main relevant international treaty. An eight-year-old addendum to the pact calls for 17% of the worlds land surface and 10% of the oceans water column (that is, the water under 10% of the oceans surface) to be protected by 2020. Currently, those figures are 15% and 6%. Campaigners want the next set of targets, now under discussion, to aim for 30% by 2030and even 50% by 2050. This last goal, biogeographers estimate, would preserve 85% of lifes richness in the long run.
As rallying cries go, Nature needs half has a ring to it, but not one that sounds so tuneful in the poor countries where much of the rhetorically required half will have to be found. Many people in such places already feel Cornered by Protected Areas, to cite the title of a report last year by the UN special rapporteur on indigenous rights. Some conservation projects wash their faces as sources of income, by attracting high-spending tourists. Most, though, are seen as impediments to development.
James Watson, chief scientist at the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), another American charity, has an additional worry about focusing on the fence-it-off approach. If you care about the presence of species rather than the absence of humans, he warns, nature needs half could be a catastropheif you get the wrong half. Many terrestrial protected areas are places that are mountainous or desert or both. Expanding them may not translate into saving more species. Moreover, in 2009 Lucas Joppa and Alexander Pfaff, both then at Duke University in North Carolina, showed that protected areas disproportionately occupy land that could well be fine even had it been left unprotected: agriculture-unfriendly slopes, areas remote from transport links or human settlements, and so on. Cordoning off more such places may have little practical effect.
The reverse of this, as Dr Joppa (who has since moved to Microsoft) and Stuart Pimm, another ecologist at Duke, have shown, is that even 17% of the worlds land surface, if chosen carefully, could be arranged to protect as many as 67% of the worlds plant species. In the United States it is the underprotected southern Appalachians, in the south-east of the country, that harbour the main biodiversity hotspots. The largest patches of ring-fenced wilderness, however, sit in the spectacular but barren mountain ranges of the west and north-west. In Brazil, the worlds most speciose country, the principal hotspots are not, as might naively be assumed, in the vast expanse of the Amazon basin, but rather in the few remaining patches of Atlantic rainforest that hug the south-eastern coast. These are where SavingSpecies, a charity that Dr Pimm has founded, has focused its resources.
Nor is speciosity the only consideration. So is risk-spreading. A team from the University of Queensland, in Australia, led by Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, has used a piece of financial mathematics called modern portfolio theory to select 50 coral reefs around the world as suitable, collectively, for preservation. Just as asset managers pick uncorrelated stocks and bonds in order to spread risk, Dr Hoegh-Guldberg and his colleagues picked reefs that have different exposures to rising water temperatures, wave damage from cyclones and so on. The resulting portfolio, reported last June in Conservation Letters, includes reefs in northern Sumatra and the southern Red Sea that have not previously registered on conservationists radar screens.
Knowing where biodiversity worth saving is concentrated is useful, says Dr Watson. But knowing how to save it is just as important. The worlds big nature conservancies, the WCS included, are therefore busily tracking what works, and at what price.
Conservation International (CI), a wildlife charity headquartered, like the Nature Conservancy, in Virginia, maintains a spreadsheet marking nearly 200 past and present projects on things like deforestation rates and species counts, as well as variables such as grant size and management quality. This latter is certainly important. In 2017 Michael Mascia, CIs chief scientist, published a paper on the matter in Nature. He and his colleagues found large disparities in staff numbers and skills between 62 marine sanctuaries in 24 countries. Though fish populations recovered in 70% of these sanctuaries after their establishment, those in the best-managed reserves did so three times faster than those in the worst-managed ones. Creating more reserves without investing adequately in the means of running them, Dr Mascia and his colleagues conclude, is likely to lead to sub-optimal conservation outcomes.
Another common findingcounterintuitive to those who take the fence-it-all-off approachis that a mixed economy of conservation and exploitation can work. For example, rates of deforestation in a partly protected region of Peru, the Alto Mayo, declined by 78% between 2011 and 2017, even as coffee production increased from 20 tonnes a year to 500 tonnes.
This chimes with Dr Pfaffs observation of the Chico Mendes reserve in Brazil, which is deep in the Amazon basin but where some rubber-tapping and farming is permitted. Ungazetted parts of this region at similar distances from roads and other sources of human pressure experience considerably higher deforestation rates, but without any concomitant increase in economic productivity. In this area, then, having (and enforcing) the right rules seems to benefit biodiversity without constraining the economy. It is true that fully protected areas see less deforestation than the reserve, but these, as Dr Pfaff shows, are areas where you would not expect much tree-cutting in the first place. They are, in other words, the sorts of places that do not really need regulatory protection. Dr Pfaff and his colleagues have replicated these findings in other countries, including Peru and Cameroon.
Environmental groups can also draw on a growing body of academic research into the effective stewardship of particular species. For too long, says William Sutherland, of Cambridge University, conservationists have relied on gut feelings. Fed up with his fellow practitioners confident but unsubstantiated claims about their methods, and inspired by the idea of evidence-based medicine, he launched, in 2004, an online repository of relevant peer-reviewed literature called Conservation Evidence.
Today this repository contains more than 5,400 summaries of documented interventions. These are rated for effectiveness, certainty and harms. Want to conserve bird life threatened by farming, for example? The repository lists 27 interventions, ranging from leaving a mixture of seed for wild birds to peck (highly beneficial, based on 41 studies of various species in different countries) to marking bird nests during harvest (likely to be harmful or ineffective, based on a single study of lapwing in the Netherlands).
Dr Sutherlands dozen full-time staff and 250 collaborators sift through 230 or so ecological journals for updates. To catalogue dead-ends as well as successes, they look at foreign-language journals, where negative results spurned by more prestigious English-language periodicals as uninteresting are likelier to appear. The book version of their compendium, What Works in Conservation, runs to 662 pages. It has been downloaded 35,000 times.
The next step, says Dr Sutherland, is to factor in costs. This is harder than it sounds. Few studies disclose expenditures. Labour costs vary a lot: besuited consultants are more expensive than sandal-wearing volunteers. Financial-reporting standards in the conservation business are a work in progress. Only in July did Conservation Biology publish a proposed set of guidelines, by a group led by Hugh Possingham, of the University of Queensland.
Then there is land. Its price rises with demand, mostly from ranchers, miners, property developers and others eager to exploit rather than preserve it. This could be taken to imply that conservationists should be eyeing expensive plots, not cheap ones where the price signals a lesser threat. In Dr Pfaffs words, no trade-offs means no impact. But others seek out bargains. Conservationists should go to places five to 20 years from the bulldozer, Dr Possingham reckons. The Nature Conservancy, where he moonlights as chief scientist, has adopted this approach to its own considerable land purchases.
Tompkins Conservation, an outfit set up by the late Douglas Tompkins, founder of the North Face, a maker of outdoor kit, does one better. It has snapped up cheap properties in Chile and Argentina, next to larger areas of disused public land, with the aim of donating them to the state on condition that adjacent private and public plots are united into single national parks. And it is working. A year ago Chiles government created two such hybrids, both in Patagonia, with a total area of 40,000km{+2}roughly the size of the Netherlands. For Tompkins, which contributed 4,000km{+2}, it was thus a tenfold return on investment.
Debates about which places to focus on pale in comparison to arguments over which species to save. Such arguments involve the concept of triage, which has divided ecologists since at least 1976, when Thomas Lovejoy, now at George Mason University, published a paper entitled We must decide which species will go forever. Triage is a term borrowed from Allied forces field hospitals in the first world war, which sorted the wounded into three groups: those too injured to be saved, those likely to recover on their own, and those for whom medics could make a difference. When the numbers of endangered species were small, it did not seem necessary to choose between trying to save the ivory-billed woodpecker or the whopping crane, Dr Lovejoy wrote. With longer and growing lists of endangered species such choices are being forced.
Businesses, politicians and philanthropists are unlikely to part with as much cash as conservationists deem necessary to save every species. Faced with limited resources, conservation groups have no option but to engage in triage, however unwitting. Nor is it evident that prioritisation crimps budgets. The Save Our Species programme introduced by New South Wales, in Australia, in 2015, has nine management streams into which species are allocated, according to the nature and seriousness of threats to them. But this came with an additional sum of A$100m ($70m) over five years. As for the acceptability of extinctions, Dr Possingham adds, sadly, that they are already very much acceptable. Just witness their accelerating rate.
In the end, economic calculations will not resolve such ethical dilemmas any more than they explain why the American public prefers spotted owls to scaleshell mussels. But nor will economic considerations go away. Estimates of how much the world spends on conservation vary between about $4bn and $10bn a year. Implementing even current UN targets, let alone nature needs half, would cost more than $70bn. Dyed-in-the-wool greens who bridle at talk of return on investment or cost-benefit analysis need to grow up.

149,How the Alstom/Siemens deal collapsed,"Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing",https://www.ft.com/content/0447e130-2a6f-11e9-a5ab-ff8ef2b976c7,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-07T05:00:32Z,"FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email.
One thing to start: We’d like to tell you about the newsletters from the FT’s Lex team, which we’re a big fan of over here at DD. The latest “Letter from New York” from Sujeet Indap on billionaires and buybacks is well worth a read. Subscribe to Best of Lex or the regional Lex Letters here.
There are five things that all profiles of Margrethe Vestager must include, according to one close follower of all things EU. DD’s favourite on the list, by some margin, is the middle finger statue that sits in her office. 
After being heavily leaned on by powerful European finance ministers and corporate titans, Vestager, the EU’s competition tsar, gave the dealmaking equivalent of the middle finger to the combination of France’s Alstom and Germany’s Siemens. She said: “Our decision today means that Europe will still have two rather than one global champion in rail infrastructure.”
(For background, read the great Lunch with the FT by Alex Barker on Vestager, if you haven’t already. You can find it here, where she explains that the above statue was a gift from a Danish trade union who was protesting against cuts in a dispute with her.)
How the deal officially collapsed on Wednesday is the subject of this tick-tock, led by the FT’s Rochelle Toplensky.
Rochelle along with Patrick McGee and David Keohane report that the fallout left Alstom’s boss ruing his mis-steps in positioning the deal.
“If I have one regret it is using that phrase ‘European champion’,” for the proposed deal that was vetoed by Brussels’ competition enforcers, said Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Alstom chief executive. “I didn’t know it would create such a negative reaction with the [European] commission . . . It made them think there was just one player rather than it being about consolidating a scattered industry.”
It seems the EU didn’t agree with the two companies’ assessment that a deal was necessary to fend off competition from a powerful Chinese rival. Digging into the particulars, the regulators took the view that Europe already enjoyed the benefits of two great companies and that the Chinese aren’t an imminent threat. Most importantly, had Alstom and Siemens agreed to further disposals — such as their high-speed train and signalling businesses — the deal would’ve been approved.
The merger “could not have been handled worse”, according to an insider. Another compared it to Jack Welch’s cowboy-booted, table-banging attempt to rescue the GE-Honeywell deal.
There was a fundamental disconnect: Siemens chief executive Joe Kaeser insists that Vestager failed to properly understand the market, while the Danish commissioner said that the companies weren’t willing to do enough. Railway rivals, regulators, customers and national competition authorities all sided with the Dane.
Beyond this merger, the veto has fuelled calls for reform of the bloc’s antitrust rules. It’s an old argument but China is a fearsome new rival, and the debate comes as Brussels gears up for parliamentary elections and a new commission. There’s a chance that reform might actually happen.
What might that entail? Sectors exempted from merger processes, looser rules on state-aid, maybe. Vestager defended the current antitrust policy — “It keeps our companies on their toes” — but suggests the bloc has many other policies it can use, such as foreign investment screening, strengthening intellectual property protection, a push against subsidies and the drive for reciprocal market access.
China’s new global business elite suffers setbacks
Chinese companies spent just over $1tn on overseas assets and construction during the five years between 2013 and 2017, an unprecedented spree that nearly doubled from the prior five-year period. Within that splurge, there were bound to be setbacks for how less-experienced, newly globalised groups performed on the world stage. 
After all, many companies, regardless of where they’re based, suffer difficulties when they take their first leap abroad.
But for Chinese companies, a credit drought at home is expediting problems overseas — just one more reminder of the increasing interconnectivity between Chinese and global markets.
Total social financing, a broad gauge of credit growth in China, has been falling since late 2016. In December, TSF grew by just 10.2 per cent, down from more than 15 per cent two years earlier and more than 33 per cent in 2009, when China was spending its way out of the global financial crisis.
Shadow banking, included within TSF, and a favoured source of finance for companies that can’t get bank loans, is also drying up. While still massive at Rmb62.1tn ($9.2tn) at the end of September 2018, shadow banking now amounts to 70 per cent of China’s annual gross domestic product, down from 87 per cent at the end of 2016.
The squeeze on credit led to a record number of bond defaults last year in China because businesses could no longer issue debt. Some of that distress has reverberated in global markets, often in cases where Chinese companies can no longer pay back banks that have lent to them using the target asset as collateral. Here are a few examples:
In September, GansuGangtai, the parent of a company that owns Italian jewellery maker Buccellati, missed a payment on a Chinese bond. 
At the end of the year, a unit of the Chinese owner of SeaWorld, Beijing-based commercial property developer Zhonghong Zhuoye, was forced to delist from the Shenzhen stock exchange at the end of 2018 due to the poor performance of the security. Zhonghong also owns US travel company Abercrombie &amp; Kent.
Sanpower, a small conglomerate with a background in commercial real estate, lost control of House of Fraser last year when the high-end UK retail chain it bought in 2014 fell into administration. It still owns several overseas businesses, such as US retailer Brookstone and biotech company Dendreon.
Hu Keqin,pictured below, bought up a bunch of French wheat fields but his company has recently suffered an onshore default and an offshore cross-default.
So what happens when a Chinese company can’t pay its overseas debt? For the most part, the situations are private and assets quietly slip into the hands of debtors and private credit funds. 
“Now companies may have to write off transactions and back out of deals,” said Violet Ho, head of the greater China business intelligence and investigations practice of Kroll, a global risk consultancy. “People are going to lose a lot of money in the process.”
Some will also cash in on the trend. Distressed debt funds in Asia are already swarming around many such assets.

Revelling in Europe’s buyout boom
The FT’s Debt Machine series has so far delved deep into the leveraged loan boom in the US, but this week its focus turned to the other side of the Atlantic.
The latest instalment offers a glimpse into the tensions brewing in the historically conservative European loan market, which is now spawning issuer-friendly features unknown even on Wall Street.
Controversial features include the so-called white list of funds private equity firms allow to buy their loans. While some say this merely reflects the market’s clubbier nature, with one investor describing Europe as “the Annabels of the loan market”, others say it is a “form of blackmail” private equity firms wield over loan buyers.
But above all, check out Robert Smith’s piece to discover the sorts of jokes CLO managers make behind closed doors about the deteriorating quality of loans they buy. Ha ha (sigh). 
Job moves
Arconic, the US manufacturing group that last month walked away from a more than $15bn sale to Apollo, removed its chief executive on Wednesday. The company said Chip Blankenship, who had led the company for 13 months, would be replaced by its chairman John Plant. Plant had previously served as chief executive of TRW Automotive. More here.
Nick Giovanni has been promoted to global co-head of the TMT group at Goldman Sachs.Details here.
Washington-based private equity group Carlyle promoted managing director Stacey Dion to global head of government affairs.
Marissa Wiley, Eric Tanck and Erik Schneider have been promoted to partner at Nixon Peabody, a corporate law firm.
Former Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond stepped down as chairman of Atlas Mara as the pan-African banking group he founded said that it was reviewing the future of its operations. Diamond will remain a non-executive director at the group. More here, including FT Lex.
GroupM, WPP’s media investment group, has hired Brian Wieser as global president, business intelligence. He joins from Pivotal Research Group. 
Oak Hill Capital Partners, a private equity group, has named Ennio Montinaro chief administrative officer and Todd Cullen as a senior adviser and operating consultant. Montinaro worked at Nomura and Citi. Cullen worked at KPMG and Ogilvy.

150,"This was the best earnings season ever for options traders, according to Goldman",This has been the best quarter for investors to buy call options ahead of earnings ever since Goldman Sachs first started recording returns.,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/07/for-day-traders-this-was-the-best-earnings-season-ever-according-to-goldman.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-07T13:59:00Z,"A options strategy this earnings season would have netted short-term traders an eye-popping 88 percent return, according to Goldman Sachs. That's the largest return since they started tracking this method nine years ago and well above the 11 percent return it typically yields.

""We find that stocks have traded up on earnings, even in a challenging market backdrop and when macro has slowed,"" Goldman equity derivatives strategists Katherine Fogertey and John Marshall wrote Thursday. ""This magnitude of earnings move is higher than we have observed since the financial crisis.""
The strategy is to buy the closest out of the money call option five days ahead of a company's fourth-quarter earnings report and then selling it a day after. Call options are a contract giving investors the right to buy a stock at a strike price within a set period of time. So if the underlying stock price jumps above the strike price (e.g., following a positive earnings result), the trader profits on the difference between the strike price and the market price, the premium, excluding the cost of the option.
That strategy has paid off so far this season, with nearly 70 percent of reporting S&amp;P 500 companies posting better-than-expected profit. The reward for topping estimates has been sizable with big moves coming off those beats. As CNBC noted earlier this month, the average stock performance in reaction to earnings was the best in nine years.
To be sure, options are a contract and can expire worthless so this strategy is not for the faint of heart and mostly used by sophisticated traders who can afford the risk."

Spotify and Take-Two Interactive Software: Neither music streamer Spotify nor video game maker Take-Two Interactive has gotten enough respect, Cramer said ahead of their earnings reports.

152,Andrea Orcel: Davos man nears summit and then slips,"Italian dealmaker, who will no longer be in top job at Santander, has big decisions to make",https://www.ft.com/content/50b728ec-2640-11e9-8ce6-5db4543da632,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-01T18:50:46Z,"This winter Andrea Orcel, a 55-year-old Italian dealmaker — once dubbed “the Ronaldo of banking” — has been at the centre of one of the most extraordinary recent sagas in finance when his surprise transfer from UBS to Banco Santander collapsed.
The Spanish lender, which had announced Mr Orcel as its next chief executive, later balked at buying him out of €50m of deferred pay he earned as head of UBS’s investment bank. 
The embarrassing public reversal has led to a bitter falling out between Mr Orcel and Santander — run by his longtime client and friend, executive chairman Ana Botín.
The Santander job would have capped off a career that has encompassed some of the biggest banking deals in history — good and bad.
Born in 1963 in Rome, Mr Orcel studied economics and commerce at the city’s university. His first job was in Goldman Sachs’ London fixed income division in 1988, but he left a year later to study for an MBA at France’s Insead. He then worked in the Paris office of Boston Consulting Group before returning to London to join Merrill Lynch’s financial institutions group in 1992, where his career took off.
His first big deal was the 1998 $25bn merger of UniCredito with rival Credit Italiano. He then quickly became the most trusted adviser of the late Emilio Botín, Ana’s father, helping him build Santander into a global giant via acquisitions in Brazil, Mexico, the UK, the US and Poland over two decades.
He is a meritocratic guy, but he wants to win. If you get in the way of his goal, he will go through you
Davide Serra, founder of asset manager Algebris
Not all of his deals worked out so well for clients. Mr Orcel was one of the architects of the disastrous €72bn tripartite buyout of ABN Amro in 2007, advising the buyers Santander, Fortis and Royal Bank of Scotland. RBS and Fortis were later nationalised.
Tall and perma-tanned, Mr Orcel is the quintessential Davos man, sporting a bright red puffer gilet and suit at the Alpine conference of the global elite. 
Mr Orcel, who speaks Italian, English, Spanish, French and a bit of Portuguese, counts Barclays chief executive Jes Staley and Lloyd’s boss António Horta Osorio as friends and confidants. 
When he testified in front of the British banking standards commission in 2013 about the controversial RBS deal, one of his MP inquisitors called him a “deal junkie” and the “Ronaldo of banking”, even after he chastised his own industry as having become “too arrogant”.
Mr Orcel long had ambitions to run his own bank — coveting the top job at UBS, as he revealed in a Financial Times interview in 2015 — and was in line for such a position after successfully turning round UBS’s investment bank.
However, the hard-charging Roman divides opinion with his demanding management style, from the 5am wake-ups to the midnight phone calls. His detractors say he has too much of a temper, prone to shouting down subordinates. His supporters counter that his direct style is the only way to whip into shape groups of egotistical millionaire dealmakers.
“He’s the best banker I’ve ever worked with and the worst manager I’ve ever seen,” a former senior UBS executive and longtime colleague of Mr Orcel said when his departure was announced. 
Davide Serra, founder of asset manager Algebris, and a client of Mr Orcel, said: “He works 18 hours a day and this is why people love him. He knows his stuff and has super-high standards with clients and colleagues.”
“When I see criticism of him,” said Mr Serra, “I think, ‘winners don’t carry baggage of losers’. When one person around you isn’t working as hard, you tell him off. He is a meritocratic guy, but he wants to win. If you get in the way of his goal, he will go through you.”
Mr Orcel’s bumper pay packages have also always attracted controversy. At Merrill Lynch he was given a bonus of more than $30m for 2008, the peak of the financial crisis. When he moved to UBS in July 2012, the Swiss bank had to pay SFr25m to buy him out of his Bank of America shares.
“We took a hit when we hired him. We knew we were going to get negative coverage, but we bit the bullet and rode it out because we thought he’d be worth it,” one UBS board member recalled. “Santander should have done the same. They knew how expensive he was from the start.”
What does Mr Orcel do next? Does he set up his own boutique — which would see him forfeit the €50m he is owed — take another top job at a listed institution, or even retire to enjoy his wealth?
Thus far London-based Mr Orcel has taken up two new high-octane sports to fill his time — kick-boxing and speed skating — in addition to waterskiing, running up hills and skiing, according to one of his friends.
“Andrea first of all is a simple man: family, daughter, work, sport, nothing else,” said Mr Serra. “But he does like Ferraris.”

153,Jeff Bezos Publishes Emails from National Enquirer Threatening to Leak Incriminating Photos,"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos says the National Enquirer threatened to leak embarrassing, nude photos of him and girlfriend Lauren Sanchez.",http://fortune.com/2019/02/07/jeff-bezos-national-enquirer-nude-photos-david-pecker-blackmail/,"{'id': 'fortune', 'name': 'Fortune'}",2019-02-08T00:24:11Z,"The dispute between Jeff Bezos and the National Enquirer just took an appropriately tabloid-ish turn.
In a detailed essay posted to Medium, the 55-year-old Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post alleged that The National Enquirer recently threatened to release racy photos of Bezos and girlfriend Lauren Sanchez. Bezos described the attempt as “extortion and blackmail.”
“I was made an offer I couldnt refuse,” Bezos wrote. “Or at least thats what the top people at the National Enquirer thought. Im glad they thought that, because it emboldened them to put it all in writing.” He added: “Ive decided to publish exactly what they sent me, despite the personal cost and embarrassment they threaten.”
Bezos then printed an email exchange, purportedly from Dylan Howard, an employee at American Media, Inc. (AMI), the company that owns the NationalEnquirer. In the message, Howard notes the publication had acquired several potentially embarrassing photos of Bezos and Sanchez, including “a full-length scantily-clad body shot [of Bezos] with short trunks” and “a naked selfie in a bathroomwhile wearing his wedding ring.”
AMI chairman and CEO David Pecker is a long-time friend of President Donald Trump. Last year, Pecker received immunity for testifying in a federal investigation into his role in payments made to two women who claimed to have had affairs with the president.
Pecker has also sought to forge deep connections with businesses in Saudi Arabia. Bezos said he’d been informed that Pecker was “apoplectic” about the Post‘s recent investigation into the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. “We were approached, verbally at first, with an offer,” Bezos wrote. “They said they had more of my text messages and photos that they would publish if we didnt stop our investigation.”
Instead, Bezos decided to pre-emptively publish descriptions of the embarrassing materials himself.
Bezos’ missive is the latest in a lengthy feud bet ween the Amazon honcho and the popular supermarket tabloid. Last month, after months of research, the Enquirer published an investigation detailing an affair between Bezos and Sanchez, a news personality and pilot. The report, which included several steamy texts between the couple, was released shortly after Bezos announced he’d split from MacKenzie Bezos, his wife of 25 years.
Earlier this week, the Bezos-owned Washington Post published its own investigation into the Enquirer‘s investigation, trying to determine whether the piece was a “political hit” on Bezos, and how his personal messages were compromised.
Bezos has strived in the past to distance himself from the work of the Post, in order to maintain the paper’s objectivity. He notably published his column not in the newspaper, but on the independently owned website Medium.
But Bezos acknowledged that his ownership of the paper “is a complexifier for me,” adding: “Its unavoidable that certain powerful people who experience Washington Post news coverage will wrongly conclude I am their enemy. President Trump is one of those people, obvious by his many tweets.”
Still, Bezos wrote, he was determined not to back down on his dealings with tabloid. “Any personal embarrassment AMI could cause me takes a back seat because theres a much more important matter involved here,” he wrote. “If in my position I cant stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can?”"

In a media landscape dominated by Netflix and YouTube, the world’s biggest brands still count on 30 seconds of national attention on the first Sunday in February. 
This year has been no different. Last month executives from CBS, the broadcaster airing the programme, touted the enduring strength of the Super Bowl in a lavish press conference where former NFL stars such as Tony Romo spoke. 
“There is no bigger or better event than the Super Bowl,” said Joe Ianniello, who is interim chief executive while CBS searches for a successor to Les Moonves after he left over sexual misconduct allegations. 
“We will generate hundreds and hundreds of millions in that single day, and the lion’s share is coming from advertising,” Mr Ianiello told reporters. 
Prices of Super Bowl advertising have soared, from $2.7m for a 30-second spot in 2008 to $5.24m in 2018. But as audiences are switching off traditional TV in favour of streaming services, brands have had little choice but to play along and embrace a live event that draws 100m viewers. 
However, there are signals their willingness is approaching a top. Reports suggest that 30-second commercials have been selling for about $5.2m, which would be unchanged from last year, after prices have risen for eight consecutive years. CBS says it has sold more than 90 per cent of inventory for the game.

The Super Bowl remains the most expensive time on television by a wide margin. The second priciest segment last year was American football’s NFC Championship, at $3.15m, followed by the Oscar’s at $2.07m, according to Kantar Media. 
“The Super Bowl is 50 per cent more expensive than the second highest-priced piece of commercial television,” said Jon Swallen, Kantar’s chief research officer. “That’s a big multiple, at some point if pricing increases faster than audiences, that means advertisers are paying more per eyeball. And there are so many alternatives out there.”
The face of advertisers is also changing. Cars and beer, the stalwarts of Super Bowl adverts, have been taking up a smaller slice of total sales in recent years. Meanwhile, spending from “media and entertainment” has been rising as streaming video companies have entered the fray. “Amazon and Netflix are using the Super Bowl to promote new series, the same way studios have historically used it to promote upcoming movies in theatres,” said Mr Swallen."

“Build that wall” was one of the signature chants at Donald Trump’s campaign rallies in the 2016 presidential election. But since winning the election and entering the White House, the US president has failed to convince Congress to fund the multibillion-dollar project. 
The stand-off led to the longest shutdown in US history and Mr Trump has hinted that he might use his State of the Union address today to declare a national emergency, allowing him to circumvent Congress.
Despite the shutdown, which probably cost the US $11bn, the US president is also likely to use the primetime speech in Washington to reiterate his claims about the strength of the economy and the stock market. How many of these claims stack up? Here is our assessment, plus five other things to look out for in the speech, beyond, of course, the facial expressions of Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House, who will be seated just over his shoulder.

Where to spend it Speaking of trade, Chinese consumers buy roughly one-third of the world’s luxury goods, but about 75 per cent of this consumption occurs overseas. Now, following a series of tax cuts, the introduction of tighter border checks and simmering US-China trade tensions, this is beginning to change. (Nikkei Asian Review)

The next generation of technology devices, the so-called internet of things (IoT), is upon us. The value proposition is enticing. Soon, every appliance in your home will respond to your voice. Your car will do the same. They will extend the reach of internet services and deliver forms of convenience that were unimaginable only a few years ago.
But take a moment to consider the less obvious dimensions of the IoT. The operating system is almost always made by Google. The voice control almost always comes from Amazon or Google. In order to work, IoT products have to listen to everything around them. If we buy enough of these devices, the IoT will be listening to every aspect of our lives, from the kitchen to the car to the bedroom. The devices will offer some convenience, but the data they collect will be used for things other than delivering the services we paid for. 
To understand how the IoT is likely to develop, we need only look at the evolution of the current generation of data surveillance products. I spent nearly 34 years as a professional tech investor and tech optimist before observing, in 2016, bad actors exploiting Facebook’s architecture and business model to harm innocent people. First, I saw misogynistic memes about Hillary Clinton being distributed by ostensibly pro-Bernie Sanders Facebook groups that appeared to be inauthentic. Then I read about a company that used Facebook’s advertising tools to gather data on people who expressed an interest in Black Lives Matter and sold the data to police departments. Next, I saw the results of the Brexit referendum. For the first time, I realised that Facebook’s algorithms might favour incendiary messages over neutral ones.
In October 2016, I contacted my friends Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, two people I had advised early in Facebook’s life, to warn them — but they politely informed me that what I had seen were isolated events that the company had addressed. After the 2016 US presidential election, I spent three months begging Facebook to recognise the threat to its brand if the problems I observed proved to be the result of flaws in the architecture or business model. I argued that failing to take responsibility might jeopardise the trust on which the business depended. When Facebook refused to take responsibility, I worked with a small group to look into the issues and raise awareness of them. 
Thanks to a series of reports over the past year about failures to protect personal data, an increasing number of the humans-formerly-known-as-users are now aware of risks. Policymakers have responded to concern with initiatives such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the passage of a GDPR-like law in the state of California, and a proposed internet bill of rights in the US House of Representatives.

Misuse of internet platforms for hate speech has dramatically altered the life of the Rohingya minority in Myanmar — or, in the case of thousands, ended it
This is progress and should be applauded. Government intervention of this kind is a first step on the path to resolving the privacy issues that result from the architecture, business models and culture of internet platforms. But privacy is not the only problem we must confront. Internet platforms are transforming our economy and culture in unprecedented ways. We do not even have a vocabulary to describe this transformation, which complicates the challenge facing policymakers. 
Where marketers in the past gathered data to match products to customers, Google, Facebook and other internet platforms use data to influence or manipulate users in ways that create economic value for the platform, but not necessarily for the users themselves. In the context of these platforms, users are not the customer. They are not even the product. They are more like fuel. 
As the Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff notes in her new book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, humans have in the past experienced industrial innov­ations so profound that they changed everything, creating a “before” and an “after”. The almost simultaneous commercialisation of electricity and of automobiles at the start of the 20th century is an example. The leaders of those industries were wise to ensure that the largest number of people would benefit from their innovations. Henry Ford understood that enabling his factory workers to become customers, to enjoy the benefits of what they produced, was essential. Google and Facebook have shown no such wisdom. They view the people who use their platforms as nothing more than a metric. 
Google, Facebook and the rest now have economic power on the scale of early 20th-century monopolists such as Standard Oil. What is unprecedented is the political power that internet platforms have amassed — power that they exercise with no accountability or oversight, and seemingly without being aware of their responsibility to society.
Not taking responsibility has been central to the culture of Silicon Valley since just after turn of the millennium, when thought leadership passed from traditional venture capitalists to the “PayPal Mafia”, visionary alumni of the payments start-up led by Peter Thiel, Elon Musk and Reid Hoffman. The PayPal Mafia were among the first to recognise the shift from a web of pages to a web of people, and their investments and insights propelled the social network generation to success. They paired a strategy of “hyperscaling” with the libertarian notion that start-ups were not responsible for the consequences of any disruption they caused.

When capitalism functions properly, government sets and enforces the rules under which businesses and citizens must operate. Today, however, corpor­ations have usurped this role. Code and algorithms have replaced the legal system as the limiter on behaviour. Corporations such as Google and Facebook behave as if they are not accountable to anyone. Google’s seeming disdain for regulation by the EU and Facebook’s violations of the spirit of its agreement with the US Federal Trade Commission over user consent are cases in point. 
People often tell me they don’t worry about privacy because their information is already “out there” and, besides, they have “done nothing wrong”. Those statements are demonstrably true for most of us but irrelevant to the discussion at hand. Google and Facebook hoover up mountains of data in the service of business models that produce unacceptable costs to society. They undermine public health, democracy, innovation and the economy. If you are a member of the Rohingya minority in Myanmar, the misuse of internet platforms for hate speech has dramatically altered your life — or, in the case of thousands, ended it. Internet platforms did not set out to harm the Rohingya or to enable interference in the politics of the EU or US. Those outcomes were unintended consequences. 
Two new platforms threaten to make these problems much worse: the IoT and artificial intelligence. For the consumer, the former offers convenience in the form of voice control and access to online services in new settings. For the vendor, it vastly increases the range and depth of surveillance. Amazon’s Alexa voice-control interface has taken an early lead, but Google Home and other technologies are likely play a role. Google’s Android operating system is the foundation of nearly all IoT systems. 
We should view all IoT products with extreme scepticism. Just as with Google and Facebook on the internet, IoT vendors characterise their surveillance as essential to the consumer value proposition. But vendors gather data less to improve the customer experience on that device than to create new economic opportunities for themselves in other places. Meanwhile, consumers suffer not only the potential harm of manipulation, but also side-effects such as the recent hack of a Nest home security system that resulted in customers believing they were under nuclear attack.
AI promises to be revolutionary. That said, it will not necessarily be a force for good. The problem is the people who create AI. They are human. They are under pressure to bring their products to market quickly. They have no incentive to invest time and resources to protect the people affected by their inventions. They train their systems with data from the real world and, to date, have not taken steps to eliminate the implicit biases that dominate the real world. 
For example, AI-based mortgage origination systems have exhibited racial bias, reproducing the “red lining” that has historically prevented people of colour from buying property in some neighbourhoods. AI-based employment applications have retained gender and racial biases common to their human counterparts. We assume that technology is value-neutral. We do not realise that the biases of its creators will infect any tech product that has not been designed to eliminate them. 
Early implementations of AI have issues that go far beyond bias. Among its most profitable applications today are those that eliminate white-collar jobs, use filter bubbles to tell people what to think and use recommendation engines to tell us what to buy or enjoy. Our jobs, what we think, and what we buy or enjoy are among the characteristics that most define us as individuals. Turning those things over to AI makes us less individual, less human. 
We can do better. I recommend two areas of emphasis: regulation and innovation. As for the former, the most important requirement is to create and enforce standards that require new technology to serve the needs of those who use it and society as a whole. The US faced this challenge with past generations of technology that were considered to be strategic, yet carried high risk. In 1938, the Food and Drug Commission began requiring new medicines to demonstrate safety and efficacy ahead of being launched. Later in the century, the country set standards for the development, handling, use and disposal of chemicals. 
In the case of AI and other major technologies, regulations are required to enable the good, while limiting the bad. Fortunately, the process of demonstrating safety and efficacy for new digital technologies is easier and far less costly than for medicine. We should prioritise the creation of standard validation and audit programmes that can be embedded in new products to ensure they do what they are supposed to do without doing harm. 
I strongly favour regulatory limits on the gathering and use of consumer data. Current practices are unacceptable, not only among internet platforms, but all companies built around Big Data. An example would be microtargeting in political campaigns, which invites abuses such as voter suppression and the spread of disinformation.
Today’s model of consent is not enough. Uses of data that do not deliver immediate value to the person from whom it is harvested should not be permitted. Society has determined that it is not appropriate to clone humans or to commercially produce anthrax or Ebola. It should do the same with many applications of Big Data. 
Internet platforms are candidates for antitrust intervention. Google, Facebook and Amazon all enjoy monopoly power and have successfully prevented competitors from gaining traction — their advantages in data, capital and scale have scared off investors and entrepreneurs. This has almost certainly retarded the rate of innovation in their core markets. 
In addition, internet platforms have exercised monopoly power against suppliers, advertisers and users, leveraging their market dominance to extract maximum value from every business relationship. Antitrust cases can be used to create space for competitors. They can also be used to limit anti-competitive business practices such as data sharing between divisions of a monopoly, an issue that the EU has raised in its latest inquiry into Facebook. To be clear, antitrust will be most effect­ive in combination with restraints on extraction business models that exploit data. 
The EU has pursued antitrust action with increasing aggressiveness, particularly against Google. The cases have focused on Google’s use of monopoly power to eliminate competition, an obvious and important place to start. In the US, the model of antitrust regulation limits the definition of consumer harm to price increases, which are not easy to prove in barter transactions of services for data. Fortunately, there is growing recognition in both political parties that the internet platforms have abused their economic power and a willingness to rein it in with antitrust action, which is the most pro-growth form of intervention available. 
If policymakers can create room for competition, I hope investors and entrepreneurs will abandon extraction business models in favour of Silicon Valley’s traditional focus on products that empower customers, what Steve Jobs famously called “bicycles for the mind”. Just as wind power and solar are profit-making opportunities to address aspects of climate change, “bicycles for the mind” will offer profits to those who help us move past the extreme flaws of today’s internet platforms and the IoT. 
The threats internet platforms present individuals and policymakers with a challenge. Fortunately, we have more power than we realise, particularly if we act in concert. Google and Facebook depend on our attention. Let’s give them less of it. The IoT requires our approval. Do not give it until vendors behave responsibly. Demand that policymakers take action to protect public health, democracy, privacy, innovation and the economy. We can do this. Let’s get started.

157,Cloud-Computing Giants Keep Growing Despite Slowdown Fears,"Earnings reports from the biggest providers of internet-based computing services – Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Alphabet Inc.’s Google – showed that these companies are grabbing a larger share of business technology spending, defying warnings from so…",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-05/cloud-computing-giants-keep-growing-despite-slowdown-fears,"{'id': 'bloomberg', 'name': 'Bloomberg'}",2019-02-05T20:12:29Z,"(Bloomberg) -- Cloud-computing companies have a message for skittish investors: demand is still booming.
Earnings reports from the biggest providers of internet-based computing services – Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Alphabet Inc.’s Google – showed that these companies are grabbing a larger share of business technology spending, defying warnings from some of their suppliers that a hot corner of the industry might be cooling off.
The cloud giants entered the year facing questions about whether they could sustain their robust growth rates in an environment of uncertain global economic growth and investment. And at the start of fourth-quarter earnings season last month, investors got some worrying news from companies that sell the networking equipment and computer chips that go into the data centers that underpin the cloud. Intel Corp., Micron Technology Inc. and Juniper Networks Inc. were among those blaming lackluster results on slower spending by data-center customers.
Now, investors have some reason to be relieved. On Monday, Google reported sales in its ""other revenue"" segment, a bucket that includes the Google Cloud Platform, of $6.49 billion in the fourth quarter, up 31 percent from a year earlier. Capital expenditures at Google soared 80 percent, to $6.8 billion. While the stock declined in extended trading on concerns about how the investments will impact profitability, much of the higher spending is tied to new data centers and related hardware -- a signal that demand for cloud services is holding up.
Last week, Amazon reported that its web services division, the leader in providing rented computing infrastructure from its data centers, saw revenue grow 45 percent in the fourth quarter, holding the same pace as the prior period. So did the gains at Microsoft’s Azure cloud group, where sales expanded by 76 percent. Finance chief Amy Hood said the software maker wasn’t seeing any signs of a slowdown in demand for internet-based programs and services. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. posted 84 percent growth in its own cloud unit.
""The move to the cloud continues and all the cloud providers are gaining,” said Kim Forrest, a senior portfolio manager with Fort Pitt Capital Group LLC. “Nobody is losing, it’s just some people are faster than others.""
Many analysts say businesses are still in the early years of a major shift in how they buy technology, reducing their reliance on stocking and maintaining their own data centers and backroom servers. Instead, many are opting to power their operations using software rented from cloud-computing giants, turning previously consumer-focused companies like Amazon and Google into bellwethers of business technology use.
Market researcher Canalys estimated that cloud-infrastructure spending climbed 46 percent in the December quarter to almost $23 billion, bringing investment for 2018 to more than $80 billion. And Synergy Research Group, which closely tracks information technology spending, last month increased its long-term forecasts for cloud-computing demand. Growth by companies’ cloud units has slowed as their businesses matured, but have so far defied expectations for a major pullback.
""We had some pretty aggressive growth forecasts in place already,"" said John Dinsdale, chief analyst at Synergy Research. ""The actual growth metrics are beyond the norms of what we’d normally expect in a large, high-growth market.""
Amazon, which in recent years has spent billions of dollars on equipment to build data centers, did tap the brakes a bit on spending through the middle of last year. The company reversed course in the fourth quarter, ramping up its purchases of property and capital leases, two line items that include some spending on data centers for Amazon Web Services. An executive indicated that outlays may grow further this year.
Amazon’s fourth-quarter increase in capital expenditures, 17 percent, “is a low number for us when you talk about supporting the AWS business that’s still growing at a high clip,” Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a conference call last week.
On Jan. 24, Intel, which supplies about 99 percent of the processors that run servers, raised alarms when it blamed a weak revenue forecast in part on a slowdown in spending from large cloud-computing customers. The company’s revenue from cloud providers rose by 24 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a 50 percent increase in the prior three months. Overall its server-chip unit posted a 9 percent revenue expansion, held back by a decline in spending by corporations and government agencies. Memory-chip maker Micron in December cited a buildup of unused stockpiles among customers, sparking concern that spending on key components of servers will weaken.
Part of the disconnect between cloud providers’ upbeat outlook and the caution from Intel and Micron could boil down to differing expectations for what happens when a wave of data centers under construction come online."

In addition to the ads, Amazon is teasing a new, celebrity-packed commercial this year, showing what might happen when the company puts Alexa in everyday objects. Expect a hilarious cameo from Harrison Ford, who tells his rambunctious dog to stop ordering so much foot by barking at its Alexa-enabled smart collar.
Last year, Amazon had to do some behind the scenes tinkering to make sure customers’ speakers wouldn’t go haywire when the word “Alexa” was mentioned ten times in the company’s 2018 Super Bowl ad. Let’s hope this year’s game plan is equally effective."
159,All about my father: inheriting a lifetime of books,What do you do with thousands of old tomes?,https://www.ft.com/content/afcc59f6-1e2a-11e9-a46f-08f9738d6b2b,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-01T05:01:00Z,"For the past couple of years I have been buried in old books. Once that might have seemed a languid dream, days and days spent in the quiet company of dusty old titles. But, instead, it has become a disheartening slog, a creeping aversion therapy for my own bibliophilia.
My father spent his life immersed in words. A journalist, he spent his mornings cutting up the broadsheets into delicate doilies of leftover copy and his evenings reading books. The books kept coming, usually second-hand finds, and they quickly began to outstrip the capacity of our small terraced house. 
When he moved in 1960 he had a set of white-painted shelves purpose-built in the study — a sturdy, elegant structure which I admired as a child when the room doubled as a dining room (at least for Christmas lunch). 
By the time he had become armchair-bound a couple of years ago, the shelves, now a smoggy shade of grey, had long disappeared behind piles of papers, folders, stacks of books and ephemera that filled the room entirely from floor almost to ceiling. Even the window panes had cracked from the outward pressure of collapsed piles of papers.
Once the study had solidified into an impenetrable block of books, the other rooms started to fill, too. First the upstairs back room, then my old bedroom (my shelves, then the floor, then my bed), the corridors and finally, slowly, the front room once my mum had died. The cellar had long been filled.
Heathcote’s father, Graham, in his study (late-1960s)
The books became a kind of building material. The house was like a sculpture that I used to think would have stood up on its own if the structure was removed. The massive cubes would have created solid where there should have been air, negative space like a Rachel Whiteread sculpture, with paper instead of concrete. 
In his series A Dance to the Music of Time, Anthony Powell titled one of his books Books do Furnish a Room. They do, but they can also become the room, physically and literally, a cast in paper. I even worried that the house might begin to collapse if I started removing the piles, whether it was the stacks that were holding everything up.
There is a shared language between the printed word and architecture. We talk about columns of copy and structures of knowledge, there are gatefold illustrations and blocks of print and there are gutters on pages. 
To open a book is like opening a door to an unknown room. And books themselves can be bricks and, like them, they can be laid in a number of bonds, upright or on their sides, structurally or as a skin. Books are the structure for the life of the mind.
Edwin Heathcote with his father in front of a bookcase in the bedroom (c1969)
My dad’s death last year was accompanied by the inevitable reflections on the futility of it all. The books are a cipher for a life lost, all that knowledge disappeared in a shallow last breath. Just as it is difficult to believe that a parent has gone taking all those memories and parts of your life with them, so it is difficult to confront the books and papers that seem to embody that life. 
Walter Benjamin, the German philosopher, in his wonderful 1931 essay “Unpacking my Library”, wrote “[It is] Not that they [the books] come alive in him, it is he who comes alive in them. So I have erected one of his dwellings, with books as the building stones, before you, and now he is going to disappear inside, as is only fitting.”
Books represent a search for meaning in a disordered and empty world. In those endless piles, in the thousands of magazines and clippings resides the evidence of a search for order, a thirst for a knowledge which might make sense of the random, unpredictable everyday. 
The irony is that the books, which started off on those purpose-built shelves in clear classifications had multiplied to the point where their abundance itself became chaos, not a manifestation of the desire for clarity and synthesis but a representation of the disorder itself, of the inevitability of loss and entropy. 
The study in the family house
For months I have been sorting, stacking and chucking, blowing dust off old titles and finding theatre tickets, letters, postcards, reviews and clippings inside paperbacks, slowly working my way through this world of words. Now that I have stripped the rubbish out, gone through the cuttings and the scrapbooks, the junk mail flyers, now that I have cleared the unread colour supplements and the press releases, I have finally managed to get back to the books. Some semblance of the old order has re-emerged. 
It presents an archaeology of obsession, a strange striptease of strata in which newer papers and books give way to progressively older works. This reveals an intriguing layering that exposes the changes in politics and design, the fads and fashions in publishing and my father’s interests as they evolved over the years. 
Libraries almost always start off with the best intentions. You can see the order in the oldest books, the classifications which saw books on the Napoleonic wars spread over the four shelves up on the left, and next to those British history and politics and a lovely-looking run of Britain in Pictures, mostly with their original dust jackets, which took my dad half a century to collect. 
But you can also trace the beginnings of disorder, the occasional novel stuffed in beside a run of books on Marxism in Latin America. There are albums of cigarette cards, squeezed into cracks between bigger books. This phase leads to fortuitous or weird juxtapositions, moths beside maths, Lenin beside the Marx Brothers, biographies of Hitler beside anthologies of Jewish humour. 
The point of a library is to have more to discover, to have a stock into which to retreat and retire, a longed-for if mythical future of endless time to read
Then, as space got scarcer, books got laid horizontally over the vertical rows and then, inevitably, double, even triple rows appeared meaning newer interests masked older obsessions. A dusty series on cathedral cities, for which I remember my dad scouring provincial bookshops, covered others on angling and butterflies. 
Then the other surfaces filled up too; the dining table/desk, the mantelpiece and finally the floor and the space beneath the table. Then the shelves themselves become remote, piles building up in front of them, then the room itself becomes impenetrable.
The strange thing is that the avid bibliophile becomes oddly careless, the books at the bottom getting crushed and bent, the others inaccessible, dusty, discoloured by sun. The books, in their messy presence, begin to exert their weight. Shelves begin to bow and crack, piles topple, a narrow access corridor left between the stacks gets blocked by a paper avalanche. 
That the majority of books became inaccessible reveals perhaps that it was not, in the end, the books that were the objects of desire but their accumulation, the dysfunctional idea of an endless library.
But now I have cleared away the detritus, the leaflets and the brochures, the provincial bus timetables and tangerine tissue wrappers, what next? I have got to the point at which most of the books — even the boxes of Penguins and Pelicans covered for decades in a layer of sooty coal dust in the boxes in the cellar — are more or less accessible. 
What on earth do you do with thousands of old books? Charity shops only want new-looking novels; they might politely accept dusty old books but they get quietly disposed of in big bags of waste. Pulped. Even libraries are getting rid of books: too bulky, too difficult to keep, too rarely read. 
Heathcote’s father at work in a newspaper office, 1940s
Books as burden even, absurdly, for those institutions founded upon them. For the moment, the books live on in limbo. A state between deadweight and delight. But I know I need to make decisions. My own shelves are already heaving with what looks worryingly like a genetic predisposition.
Sure there are a few desirable things in here: nicely bound military histories, some old art folios, a (very) few first editions. Yet most of it, most of a life’s work of almost-obsessive collecting, marginalia, knowledge and often superb design, is barely even recyclable. 
Second-hand book dealers want only first editions of novels by famous authors in pristine dust jackets. Who has those? Surely people read books, they pile them up, the books get dusty, their edges fox, the spines fade in the sunlight, the jackets get rubbed. 
Charity shops only want new-looking novels. They might politely accept dusty old books but they get quietly disposed of in big bags of waste. Pulped.
Books that have been read and used and have contributed to human happiness are never pristine. And then there is the sense of hope in the unread volumes, now dusty and neglected but still full of potential. 
Some may look at this obsessive accumulation as a mania. Why buy so many when you surely have no real hope of reading them all? But that is the point of a library, to have more to discover, to have a stock into which to retreat and retire, a longed-for if mythical future of endless time to read. My father complained towards the end of his life that now he finally had all the time in the world to read, he kept dozing off. 
I have rummaged through dust and crumbling papers, finding weird titles and odd volumes. I have been immersed in the smell of old books, which I still, despite everything, love. It has not put me off second-hand bookshops. My fingers become grey and dry from the residue of old paper, skin and newsprint and in that dust I cannot help seeing a correspondence between life and death, between the ashes I have only just buried and the veneers of dust on paper. The question is, if you love books, what on earth do you do with them?
Some rare books are easy to spot because of the fame of the author, or the title, or both: a first folio Shakespeare, Charles Darwin’s On the Origin of Species, Isaac Newton’s Principia. But there are other books that may not seem interesting to the casual observer, but which are highly valuable to the specialist. 
That is why you should seek an expert opinion. Rarity alone is not enough to give value; there also has to be a market. That is something that only an experienced bookdealer will know.
Books in bad condition are unlikely to be saleable, no matter what they are. Whether or not a book is complete or the binding is in one piece is important, even if the binding is original. If you take a book with damaged binding to a dealer, they will offer you a lower price because they are going to have to pay to repair it.
There is no hard and fast way of telling whether a book is a first edition. They rarely have the words “First Edition” printed in them, so you have to go by bibliographic details, such as the date of publication or the dust-jacket design. These are things you either know by experience or by looking at a bibliography.

Second editions are simpler, because they will often say “Second Edition” on the title page, or have a line that says “First published 1932, reprinted 1933”, or similar. Every publisher does things differently and the further back you go from mass-mechanised book production, the more difficult it gets. Such books were less likely to be dated and more likely to have variations.
One of the best books to have is an inscribed copy. That can add enormously to the value. If you have letters with it, even better. Dealers want an item that can tell a story. The more of the story, the better. We have a copy of Spike Milligan’s Rommel? Gunner Who?, usually worth about £50. However, this copy was inscribed by Stephen Hawking just before he lost the ability to write, which has vastly increased its value to the tune of £24,000. Children usually drop eggs on their books or try to eat them. So children’s books in very good condition are sought after, too. 
Look for a bookseller who is a member of a trade association. Henry Sotheran’s is a member of the Antiquarian Booksellers Association and we are bound by a code of ethics. Companies that have been around for a long time generally have a good reputation for a good reason; they are fair dealers.
If you take a book to a dealer and they do not want it, there are always auctions — a good option if you really do not want to take it to a charity shop.

160,America’s new antitrust agenda,Democratic hopefuls are making the case for action against Big Tech,https://www.ft.com/content/c27a517a-2631-11e9-8ce6-5db4543da632,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-03T13:18:12Z,"Facebook reminds me of nothing so much as kudzu, an indomitable creeping vine which can be chopped, mowed, sprayed with herbicide or even set on fire, and yet will keep growing, suffocating everything to which it attaches itself. Each week seems to bring a new scandal for the social media company, yet it just beat estimates on revenue, earnings and growth, making more per user than it ever has before. 
But US lawmakers are preparing to do what the most aggressive gardeners do to kudzu — inject poison into the roots. Last week, following new revelations about how the company had lured people aged between 13 and 35 into selling their privacy so that Facebook could harvest more of their personal data, Senator Mark Warner announced he had “begun working on legislation that would require large platforms such as Facebook to provide users, on a continual basis, with an estimate of the overall value of their data to the service provider”. 
This is a big deal, and an important new strategic twist in the battle between Big Tech and regulators. User data are the most valuable commodity for companies such as Facebook, or indeed any company in the digital economy. But its value is fully known only to the companies that harvest it. The Warner proposal aims to create the sort of transparency that might give users pause. If you knew, for example, that Facebook or Google were earning twice as much from your data this year as they did last year, but offering no better service in return, you might be more inclined to think about switching to a platform that gave you more. 
That, of course, presupposes the existence of viable competitors to the current handful of platform giants — which is another thing that putting a price on data could facilitate. The antitrust conversation is heating up in the US: there is growing interest in the topic within not only the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, but also Congress, where the House subcommittee on antitrust may begin looking at platform competition issues soon. 
But monopoly policy in America is currently driven by “Chicago School” thinking, which espouses the idea that as long as consumers aren’t paying too much for a good or service, all is well. Members of the “New Brandeis” school of thought, including the legal scholar Lina Khan (who recently consulted at the FTC) and Big Tech critic Barry Lynn, who runs the influential Open Markets Institute (which has advised presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren), disagree. They would like to take antitrust policy back to a broader interpretation of political power, in which societal welfare, rather than just that of consumers, is taken into account. This makes a lot of sense in an era in which the big technology companies, who have blanketed Washington with money and lobbyists, are exerting kudzu-like control over the political economy. 
However, it’s a slow burn solution that will require time and case law to develop. In the meantime, putting a price on data, or at least treating it as a core asset for companies, could allow regulators to build an antitrust case by proving that platforms like Facebook, Google or Amazon have actually harmed consumers by taking disproportionately more value than they give. 
In his new book Zucked, Roger McNamee, a Facebook seed investor turned Big Tech critic, lays out how this might work, using Google as the proxy. “Each new search, email message, or map query generates appropriately the same form of value to the user,” Mr McNamee writes. “Meanwhile, Google receives at least three forms of value: whatever value it can extract from that data point through advertising, the geometric increase in advertising value from combining data sets, and new use cases for user data made possible by combining data sets.” 
That is what allows them to send you targeted advertising with all the precision of a drone strike, something that businesses of all kinds pay dearly for. Mr McNamee concludes that consumers are giving up far more in data value than they receive. If data were dollars (which, of course, they are) “the Chicago School would find that situation to be in violation of its antitrust philosophy”. 
Facebook and Google would argue that consumers are not troubled by any of this. But consumers are not troubled by many things — predatory subprime mortgages, say, or algorithmic credit biases — until the full implications of these things are understood. I suspect that if we all knew how precisely we are being tracked and how richly we are being monetised by the platform tech companies, there would be more of a public outcry. 
Academics are busy working out how to price data fairly (Mr Warner’s legislation would give the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board that task). Meanwhile, Big Tech antitrust issues have already become a litmus test for Democratic presidential candidates in 2020. Ms Warren has made the topic a central part of her platform, while Kamala Harris came under fire recently for not addressing it adequately. And Cory Booker has said: “I think the US government absolutely should take a look at Google.” One way or another, I suspect it will.

161,Car credit is driving wealthy UK towns into debt,Concern that saturation of new vehicles will fuel riskier loans in second-hand market,https://www.ft.com/content/e9c8683c-2084-11e9-b2f7-97e4dbd3580d,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-09T17:50:55Z,"Guildford, an affluent commuter town in London’s so-called stockbroker belt, is the location for a personal debt boom that has sparked concerns among economists about the sustainability of the UK economy.
Unsecured personal debt in the area rose by more than 30 per cent between 2013 and 2018 — one of the highest rates in the country, according to an FT analysis of data from the major high street banks. 
Guildford is not alone: other wealthy towns around the capital have seen a similar rise in personal debt — it is up 36 per cent in Hemel Hempstead, 39 per cent in St Albans and 31 per cent in Redhill. 
What links the towns is the increase in car sales financed by loans — a trend now broadening out into the riskier second-hand sector. 
“You can’t beat Guildford for prestige vehicle sales,” said Ricardo Trigo, general sales manager at Sandown, a Mercedes-Benz dealer just outside the town, who said that for the past few years more people have been buying on credit.
Overall, the FT analysis revealed a strong correlation between increased personal borrowing and car ownership, a result of the transformation of Britain’s car market through personal contract purchases over the past decade. 
These allow consumers to pay a deposit and a monthly fee for a specified period, typically three years, after which they are given the option to buy the car from the manufacturer for a fixed price. 
Mr Trigo compared the borrowing boom to the rising popularity of subscriptions like Amazon Prime or Netflix. New forms of credit are “like having a subscription to driving a new Mercedes-Benz”, he said.
But now there are fears that with the new car market saturated, the boom is coming to an end, potentially dampening activity in the economy and leading to an increase in the riskier loans for second-hand cars. 
Recent data from the Bank of England showed that the annual rate of consumer borrowing dropped to 6.4 per cent in December 2018, down from a peak of around 11.6 per cent in November 2016.
Over the past 10 years, personal contract purchases, which allow drivers to only pay for the depreciation of the car, have became the dominant form of finance, said Adrian Dally, head of motor finance at the Finance and Leasing Association. 
Growth in the market was helped along by low interest rates but boosted by the adoption of new forms of debt that allowed drivers the use of a car without the high upfront costs of buying. 
These deals mean that drivers can pay the same monthly fee and get a better car, Mr Dally said. “The quality of the car park has gone up”, he added, referring to the more expensive cars now seen more regularly on British streets. 
But while the borrowing provided a tailwind for the UK’s consumer-driven economy as it recovered from the last recession, the shift from outright or full ownership to leasing can only happen once and growth could now slow. 
The motor trade now sees used cars as a potential growth market: according to FLA data, loans for used cars grew by 13 per cent in the year to November compared with just 2 per cent growth for new cars. 
Mr Trigo said that many of his competitors have targets to sell around 50 per cent of their used cars on credit, up from current levels of between 25 and 40 per cent. Sandown had already hit that target, he said.
But experts say the spread into the second-hand market could lead to trouble. “Our worries with all of this is when it penetrates into the subprime market,” said Peter Tutton, head of policy at debt charity StepChange. “Second-hand cars on subprime: that’s where we’d expect to see problems.”
For the moment the charity is not helping many who get into difficulty with car loans as “the boom was mainly in prime credit new cars, people who are more affluent [and] in more stable financial situations.” 
Average pay for full-time workers living in Guildford, for example, is £723 a week, around 26 per cent higher than the British average. 
But less well-off areas such as County Durham in England’s north east and Powys in Wales, where wages are lower, public transport is limited and people depend on cars to get around, have seen an increase in debt too. 
“The analogy is with mortgages,” Mr Tutton said. With interest rates and unemployment low, his charity currently deals with few people who have fallen into arrears on their mortgages. But he warned: “When a recession comes along that will go through the roof.”"
162,Apple Matchmakers May Finally Be in Business - Washington Post,"Apple Matchmakers May Finally Be in Business Washington Post Even in the ever-changing technology industry, there are some constants.

One of those is matchmakers suggesting Apple Inc. buy Netflix Inc. or (insert hot internet/media company of the moment). 
I have tended to dismiss these ideas, including the Netflix (and other) acquisition suggestions this week from a JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. stock analyst. Apple typically builds everything on its own, although it occasionally buys small companies to plug in technologies it thinks are important. Apple bought Siri, for example, and struck deals with several computer chip and component companies. 
Apples largest purchase  Beats, for about $3 billion was the exception that proved the rule. The 2014 deal was the foundation for what became Apple Music. Apple had resisted streaming music that people didnt own, and it may have needed outside expertise and technology to nudge itself in a different direction. 
Now, Apple is undergoing a drastic corporate remodeling, and its approach to build versus buy may need to change again.
Apple wants to rely less on selling devices and more on persuading its built-in audience to spend more on apps and subscriptions to digital music, online video and news. Future Apple digital offerings must work well on multiple computing devices, not just the ones that Apple makes. That is not a skill Apple has honed in-house. 
The company has been hiring Hollywood experts for its expected Netflix-like web video service, but some observers think they could use more help. Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities suggested recently that Apple buy Sony Corp.s U.S. television-and-film production division or another entertainment machine to push along its efforts.
Netflix itself may be out of reach, even for Apple. But Netflix has shown that a savvy company doesnt need to buy an entertainment company to become an entertainment empire. Again, though, different times for Apple may call for different and unusual measures. 
I should say that its fun but also foolish to predict the next big acquisition by Apple or any other company. Dealmaking is unpredictable. And dear reader, Ive fallen victim to this problem. I wrote a piece two years ago saying big tech companies werent going to ride in and buy companies in stagnant industries. Within months, Amazon agreed to buy a supermarket chain for $14 billion. Im now out of the tech M&amp;A prediction game.
And while were talking about rethinking Apples approach to mergers and acquisitions, theres also an opportunity for Apple to think different with its retail stores. Apple started to open its own shops in 2001, just before the debut of the iPod that became Apples first truly large-volume product.
It was helpful for people to see, try and get help with the unfamiliar Apple music player and later, the iPhone in stores that the company controlled. (Awkward flashback: BusinessWeek magazine, now Bloomberg Businessweek, published a 2001 column with this headline: Sorry, Steve. Heres Why Apple Stores Wont Work.) 
More recently under Angela Ahrendts, the retail store boss who is leaving her post after about five years, Apple opened fewer stores but created  larger and more dramatic retail outposts. I dont have an answer, but I wonder if the mission of the stores needs to change now that Apple is trying to be a different, less hardware-dependent company. Should Apple focus on more but smaller stores to maximize opportunities to interact in-person with more of its customers? Could the stores be even more aggressive about coaching people on the merits of Apples growing lineup of apps and services? 
Apple may be more than happy to stick with its strategy on stores and with its corporate takeovers. But those of us on the outside cant stop wondering what Apple could do differently to make its desired reformation real.

163,Fed at early stages of pivot towards next easing cycle,US central bank’s U-turn a necessary step as global economy slows faster than expected,https://www.ft.com/content/fb3b78ec-2607-11e9-b329-c7e6ceb5ffdf,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-01T23:30:24Z,"The dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency and the vast US government bond market ensures the Federal Reserve’s status as the dominant central bank. Its policy decisions and guidance matter immensely, particularly for emerging market economies that have plenty of dollar-denominated debt to service.
A U-turn on monetary policy this week from the Fed has been billed by some as a twin capitulation to both financial markets and President Donald Trump’s incessant demands that it should stop raising interest rates. 
Such critiques miss the burning issue: a decade after the financial crisis, the global economy is slowing much faster than expected, and debt levels have ballooned, particularly in EM and in the corporate world. Many investors still pin their hopes on Beijing stimulating economic activity this year, but do so as China is enduring a credit crunch and trying to prevent a trade war with Washington.
With this backdrop, it’s hardly a shock that in just over a month the Fed has switched from signalling further rate increases to this week’s emphasis that patience is now its watchword. 
The Fed’s commitment to a patient approach towards interest rates and the willingness voiced this week to consider stemming the speed at which the balance sheet is shrinking mean the central bank is now sitting on the sidelines. Moderating inflation pressure helps provide it a cover to do so even while, as this week’s employment report reminded everyone, the US jobs market remains healthy.
Instead of seeing the Fed’s pause as a cave-in to the recent market turmoil, investors should focus on what made policymakers reverse course so quickly. Aside from economic weakness in China, the eurozone and Japan, the Fed faces a US economy experiencing signs of late-cycle weakness, especially in housing. At the same time, corporate earnings growth expectations for the first half of this year have been cut significantly to the low single digits. 
Given the mammoth scale of corporate borrowing in recent years, the ability of companies to grow their earnings has been a critical cushion. It’s a cushion that is now deflating. The large drop in corporate bond prices during December’s rout appears to have left a mark with the Fed, as it should. US stocks may have enjoyed their best January since 1987, but the premium investors are demanding to buy credit has widened sharply over the past 12 months and remains near a level seen in 2016, according to the Moody’s BAA index.
The Fed’s actions this week amounts to a ratification of the concerns that markets flagged during a turbulent fourth quarter last year. Listening to markets and detecting signs of trouble before they hurt the broader economy is exactly what central banks should do. There’s plenty of justified criticism about the Fed failing to appreciate the extent of the mortgage and credit bubble that some saw building before 2007. My question to a Fed official in May that year about the sharp rise in repo funding via banks that left them very reliant on short-term funding was dismissed at the time as a poor way to gauge the leverage within the financial system. 
Asset prices matter for modern economies that function thanks to hefty amounts of borrowing. Since the US central bank’s former chairman Alan Greenspan initiated the now famous “Fed Put” with rate cuts after Black Monday in 1987, policymakers have remained ever ready to step in and support markets. This happened in 1998, then during 2001 and again after 2008 with the new ammunition of quantitative easing.
Creating breathing room for global markets is usually achieved via a weaker dollar. And judging by the bullish response in emerging markets, the Fed has helped China this week. With the renminbi touching a six-month high on Thursday, there is scope for China to ease interest rates without unleashing a much weaker currency that would only complicate Beijing’s stimulus efforts.
Clearly, Fed officials are worried by market turmoil infecting the broader economy. They are also concerned about clouds in the form of trade frictions, China’s financial crunch, high levels of corporate leverage, lacklustre US earnings growth and Brexit. The coming weeks should offer more clarity on trade, as well as on the health of the US and global economies. In this context, Treasuries and other major sovereign bond markets will be important barometers to watch.
The US bond market is doing more than telling us that the Fed has just paused; it’s suggesting that the central bank is at the very early stages of a pivot towards the next easing cycle. This week yields on the two and five-year notes dipped below 2.50 per cent, the upper band of the current overnight federal funds rate.
Lower yields in developed world bond markets will support risk assets and, together with a weaker dollar, there are already signs of money chasing high-yielding EM currencies as the carry trade finds a renewed spring in its step.
What should give investors pause for thought is a further decline in top-tier bond yields and inflation expectations, which would suggest the Fed has misjudged the cycle and already tightened policy too far. As seen during the second half of 2000 and 2007, US Treasury yields do send a message that deserves to be listened to.

""It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place,"" Trump said, according to excerpts. ""This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it.""
Trump's remarks on drug pricing come after the administration proposed a ban on so-called backdoor deals cut by pharmaceutical companies with middlemen who get preferred status for their drugs through Medicare.
Right now, drug companies pay rebates to pharmacy benefit management (PBM) companies like CVS Health to include their medications on Medicare Part D plans. The Trump administration's proposal would leave PBMs receiving just a flat fee for including drugs on those plans. It would also pass approximately $29 billion in drug-company rebates to consumers.
Wall Street strategists said ahead of the speech that Trump's comments on drug pricing, along with infrastructure and trade, could be market moving. Strategists warned major drug stocks like Merck and Pfizer, as well as related companies like CVS Health and UnitedHealth, could come under pressure if Trump came out strong against high drug prices.
Trump is scheduled to deliver his second State of the Union address at 9 p.m. ET. The speech comes more than a week after the longest government shutdown in U.S. history ended. On Jan. 25, both Trump and Democratic leaders in Congress agreed to re-open the government for three weeks.

165,Fund industry must use the right type of machine learning,Simply following Amazon’s successful model sets up investors for disappointment,https://www.ft.com/content/fd8ace33-86a5-3d11-a261-81166736de3d,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-06T05:00:02Z,"Last Christmas, you could thank Amazon’s machine-learning algorithms for the tempting gift recommendations that flashed on to your screen.
Amazon and other groups could predict every want and need using large data sets and computing power.
Machine-learning (ML) algorithms find complex patterns without a human having to direct the search. They learn from examples presented to them and do not need humans to explain how to interpret those examples.
In general terms, there are two ML approaches: the “black box” paradigm used commercially by companies such as Amazon, Google and Netflix, and the “causality” paradigm applied at scientific institutions such as the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
Amazon’s recommended purchases are an example of the black box at work. These “recommender systems” are ML algorithms that match your preferences with other customers, using your previous purchase and rating patterns among their data points. 
When customers in your identified peer group enjoy a product, the system has high confidence when it recommends that product to you. After your feedback, it may adjust your peer group. The algorithm does not build a psychological or sociological theory. It produces forecasts based on revealed preferences without understanding the cause-effect mechanism that explains those particular preferences.
In contrast, research laboratories’ causality paradigm is entirely different. The goal of the scientific method is to derive, from empirical evidence, a theory of how X causes Y. Scientists use ML to narrow the search for potential Xs. For instance, if removing variable X prevents us from forecasting Y, then X may contain information relevant to understanding Y. 
Good theories can deliver accurate forecasts but their ultimate goal is to explain why things happen. They advance our understanding about phenomena. Science uses ML for refining and perfecting theories, not for building black boxes. ML has made possible many of the latest scientific breakthroughs, particularly in the natural sciences.
Like the technology giants, many financial companies have invested heavily in ML. They have large data sets and computational resources and have rightly concluded that ML can play a critical role in modernising finance. 
Many managers, though, focus on the wrong type of ML. They use ML for building financial black boxes not financial theories — a data-mining exercise that ultimately sets investors up for disappointment. Asset managers should focus instead on the paradigm applied by science.
If investors care only about profits, why should anyone worry about theory? 
First, arbitrage forces subdue the signal-to-noise ratio in financial data sets. As a consequence, these data sets are noisier than natural data sets. In the absence of theories, ML algorithms confound noise with signal, a phenomenon known as overfitting. An overfit algorithm makes wrong recommendations that lead to uncompensated risks. 
Second, financial systems are dynamic. Patterns may cease to repeat. A theory tells us why X causes Y, and this is helpful for determining whether the strategy is real and persistent. A financial theory gives us the confidence to invest in or stick with a strategy, even as it undergoes a drawdown.
By embracing the black box approach, investment companies may be trying to monetise the hype generated by recent ML successes. It is important for investors to recognise the fundamental differences between the two ML paradigms, and why financial black boxes are not aligned with their investment goals.
In the words of economist Lars Hansen, a Nobel laureate: “[D]ata seldom, if ever, speaks for itself.” Developing investment strategies purely by data-mining will lead to unreliable outcomes and losses, because correlations are often spurious and correlation does not imply causation. We need ML to develop better financial theories and we need financial theories to restrict ML’s propensity to overfit. Without this theory-ML interplay, investors are placing their trust on high-tech horoscopes.

This could still be something of a Pyrrhic victory, given the iPhone maker bears battle scars such as a share price still down by more than a quarter from its peak last October, a valuation below $1tn and lingering concerns about its outlook in the face of slowing global growth.
In intraday trade on Tuesday, both Apple and Microsoft — up 1.4 per cent and 1 per cent, respectively — were weighing in with market caps of about $820bn.
The paths of major tech stocks since late last year have been far from uniform. Apple better resisted than most of its peers the early stages of a market sell-off that was triggered in early October by concerns the Federal Reserve was firmly in favour of additional interest rate rises.
But as the outlook for global growth dimmed and its own suppliers variously revealed revenue and profit warnings, its share price slide picked up pace.
In late November, Microsoft, whose shares had also been relatively resilient, briefly reclaimed the title of world’s most valuable company from its longstanding rival. It marked the first time Apple had been dethroned as numero uno since it overtook ExxonMobil in 2011.
By January 3, when Apple shocked the market with a rare revenue warning, its market cap had been overtaken by those of Microsoft, Amazon and Google parent Alphabet.
This was also the day Apple shares bottomed out, unlike those other, err, MAGA tech stocks that reached their sell-off nadir on December 24.
It is noteworthy that at the start of the year, tech stocks were not exhibiting the same level of outperformance versus the broader market during the recovery as they had on previous occasions. Some of that may have been to do with Apple, still a heavyweight player, taking its time to coax investors back.
Sentiment towards the company seems to have improved following its quarterly result at the end of January and has helped underpin the most recent leg of its share price rally.
None of the 45 analysts covering Apple rate it a sell, according to a Bloomberg survey, but the average 12-month target price among them of $177.35 is only 2.2 per cent higher than its current level."
167,Ivanka Trump’s New Women’s Initiative Relies on Agency Whose Budget the President Tried to Cut,The $50 million initiative funded by USAID aims to improve economic security for 50 million women worldwide by 2025.,http://fortune.com/2019/02/07/ivanka-trump-women-program-usaid/,"{'id': 'fortune', 'name': 'Fortune'}",2019-02-07T13:05:55Z,"In the first two years of his presidency, President Donald Trump’s America First agenda has meant he’s pushed to reduce funds for foreign assistance. His administration has advocated repeatedly for cuts to the amount of money sent abroad, twice attempting to slash the budget of the U.S. Agency for International Development or USAID by a third. And there’s still talk of redirecting money from foreign aid to a southern border wall.
Yet on Thursday, the White House is revealing a new women’s empowerment program that aims to improve economic security for 50 million women around the world by 2025, drawing on funds from USAID, the agency whose budget Trump has targeted.
The champion of the program is Ivanka Trump, senior adviser and first daughter. The Womens Global Development and Prosperity Initiative will take the form of a $50 million fund within USAID, and will partner with private companies including UPS(ups) and Walmart(wmt), the New York Times reports.
Ivanka Trump has argued that the new program is not a departure from the administration’s past stances on foreign aid. Were proud of our legacy of being a generous nation, looking to uplift others around the world. But we want to do so in a fiscally responsible way, she told the AP. In an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal, she presented female empowerment as a matter of national security.
“Research suggests that the more women are excluded from full participation in a countrys economy, the likelier it is that the country will be involved in conflict and respond to a threat with immediate violence,” she wrote “When women are free to thrive, they bring national stability, as well as more jobs and economic growth. Expanding womens economic participation has the potential to boost global economic output by an additional $12 trillion by 2025.” 
President Trump teased the program in his State of the Union address on Tuesday. “As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever Government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries,” he said.
Since she joined the administration two years ago, Ivanka Trump has focused on womens economic issues, leading an effort to launch a World Bank fund to help drive womens entrepreneurship and advocating for the Womens Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act, which bolsters efforts by USAID.
USAID said in its 2018 fiscal report that it has built “more than 1,600 partnerships with the private sector that involve more than 3,500 unique organizations” over the past 15 years, raising $16 billion in public and private funds not from the U.S. government.
The Womens Global Development and Prosperity Initiative launch on Thursday will include a roundtable discussion and presidential signing ceremony, Time reports. Attendees are to include Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, national security adviser John Bolton, officials from USAID and UNICEF, elected officials and business leaders, as well as women who are the beneficiaries of this type of aid."

They want to do good’,https://www.ft.com/content/a17ef974-f307-34b5-8751-60ccaab5b513,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-02T11:00:00Z,"The fight against climate change will lead to profound changes across the investment industry as more younger workers demand action to save the planet, according to Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury.
Mr Welby said rising demand for responsible investment, as millennials accumulate wealth and pension savings, would lead to “enormous changes” in financial markets and asset management. 
“Millennials want to know that their money is doing more than earning a good return. We are seeing a major shift in attitude among huge numbers of young people from avoiding doing harm to wanting to do good, particularly in the matter of climate change,” he said.
The archbishop’s comments were delivered at an event in London hosted by BMO Global Asset Management before the launch of a consultation on the UK stewardship code by the Financial Reporting Council.
Elroy Dimson, a finance professor at Cambridge Judge Business School, said successful engagements by asset managers on ESG issues with 613 US companies between 1999 and 2009 were shown to have produced improvements of 7.1 per cent in stock returns over the following 12 months. 
“Successful ESG engagements are worthwhile. They can help to attract consumers which leads to higher sales and improved profitability,” said Mr Dimson. 
Previous efforts by Mr Welby to highlight ESG issues have prompted controversy. His attack last year on Amazon’s low-tax, low-wage policies led to a torrent of criticism after it emerged the church’s pension fund held shares in the online retailer.
Engagement with companies was necessary for responsible investors, even if it raised reputational risks for pension funds, Mr Welby said at the BMO event. 
“I would worry if the Church on England was not engaging vigorously with Amazon,” he said. 
Europe-domiciled mutual funds that incorporate ESG factors attracted €34.4bn in new cash last year, down 40 per cent on the €57.9bn gathered in 2017, according to Morningstar, the data provider. 
Growing numbers of asset managers are also adding sustainability criteria to existing funds, avoiding the need to create dedicated ESG products. 
“It may also be a way for asset managers to reinvigorate ailing funds that are struggling to attract new inflows,” said Hortense Bioy, director of passive strategies and sustainability research for Europe at Morningstar. 
BlackRock said last week that investors had arrived at a “why not?” moment in sustainable investing. It cautioned, however, that a lack of accepted reporting standards for ESG criteria was damaging the ability of investors to harness the potential of sustainable investment."

div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
Dozens of earnings, from companies like Alphabet,Disney and Eli Lily, report in the week ahead, and there are just a few economic reports like trade data and ISM services on Tuesday. Investors will also be watching the outcome of Treasury auctions for $84 billion in Treasury notes and bonds Tuesday through Thursday, after the Fed's dovish tone helped put a lid on interest rates in the past week.
Nearly half the S&amp;P 500 companies had reported for the fourth quarter by Friday morning, and 71 percent beat earnings estimates, while 62 percent have beaten revenue estimates. But earnings growth forecasts for the first quarter continue to decline as more companies report, and they are currently barely breaking even at under 1 percent growth, versus the 15 percent growth in the fourth quarter, according to Refinitiv.
""Granted the more we hear from companies, and particularly in terms of their guidance and projections on revenues, things can slowly change. The first thing companies do is they stop spending money. Cap spending slows down, and if revenue growth does not pick up, they let people go. This is still wait and see,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
Krosby said the 304,000 jobs added in January did ease some concerns about a slowing economy, as did a stronger than expected ISM manufacturing report Friday. But the view of the first quarter is still unclear, as many economic reports were missed during the government shutdown. Economists expect growth in the first quarter of just above 2 percent, after growth of about 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter.
Stocks closed out January with a sharp gain on Thursday, and started February on Friday on a flattish note. The S&amp;P 500 has rebounded about 15 percent from its Dec. 24 closing low. Last month's 7.9 percent gain was the best performance for January in more than 30 years.
The old Wall Street adage says 'so goes January, so goes the year.' If that holds, stocks could finish 2019 higher. But February is another story, and on average, it is a flat month for the S&amp;P 500.
""The tug of war that you saw in the market, that was going on in the last half of last year is playing out in the data. Some of the data is a bit lower, but some of the economic surprises are picking up to the upside rather than downside,"" said Krosby.
Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the ISM may have improved but it reflected very low exports and flat backlogs, even though there was a snap back in new orders.
""I would fade the jobs report,"" said Boockvar, noting the level of growth may have been inflated by government workers taking on part-time jobs during the government shutdown.
Boocvkar said the jobs report also looked strong on the surface, but he's concerned the unemployment rate ticked up to 4 percent from 3.9 percent.
""The question of whether we go into a recession or not is how does the stock market affect confidence?"" Boockvar said. Confidence readings in the past week were low, and consumer sentiment Friday was its lowest since before President Donald Trump took office.
Krosby said stocks could test recent lows or put in a higher low. If there's a big selloff, ""That would not necessarily mean it was a clue a recession is coming. It's just a normal testing mechanism,"" she said.
The Fed removed a big concern from the markets in the past week, when its post-meeting statement and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's briefing tilted dovish, assuring markets the Fed would pause in its interest rate hiking. Investors had feared the Fed would hurt the softening economy with its rate hikes. Now, the biggest fears are about the trade war between the U.S. and China and slowing Chinese growth.
The jobs report, and the ISM manufacturing data were also important because the lack of data during the government's 35 day shutdown has left gaps in the economic picture.
""This is really a sign the Fed stole the thunder from the economic data. By saying they're patient plasters over any kind of economic data in the near term, and I suspect the near term lasts through the first quarter because of the government shutdown, the weather, weak GDP,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex.
Chandler said the markets will be hanging on any news on the trade talks with China. ""Even if it's not the all encompassing trade deal we were promised, it's a return to where we were before with China promising to buy energy and farm products. We'll continue to have some kind of talks with the China, like we had under Obama and Bush,"" said Chandler."
170,"Stocks to watch: Indivior, Pandora, BP, Wm Morrison","Metro Bank can deliver abnormal growth at its lower price, says Investec",https://www.ft.com/content/e56cec9a-2930-11e9-88a4-c32129756dd8,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-05T14:27:56Z,"Tuesday 13:30 GMT
What’s happening
● Indivior hit a year-to-date low after a US court rejected its request to reconsider its decision to remove an injunction that had prevented Dr Reddy’s Labs from launching a generic version of Suboxone, its blockbuster opiate addiction treatment. Ahead of the injunction being lifted on February 11 Indivior said it intended to continue launching appeals, including to the Supreme Court. 
The news came a day after Indivior scrapped a proposed injunction against Alvogen over its plans to clone Suboxone. It means Alvogen joins Dr Reddy’s, Sandoz and Mylan in being able launch copycat versions as soon as the law allows. “It will immediately be a relatively crowded market which could impact pricing faster than we initially anticipated,” said Jefferies. 
Indivior also flagged a higher than expected 2019 operating cost base of around $440m to $460m as it tries to carve out a market for next-generation opium treatment Sublocade. That suggests Indivior will cut guidance when delivering full-year results due February 14, said Jefferies.
● BP led the FTSE 100’s biggest gainer after its fourth-quarter results smashed expectations. Clean earnings of $3.48bn for the quarter compared with a $2.63bn consensus as BP improved production and made a bigger gain than expected from gas trading. The strong results raised the possibility of BP launching a share buyback or increasing its dividend this year, said JPMorgan Cazenove.
● Pandora jumped on better than feared Christmas-quarter results from the Danish jewellery retailer, which has been a popular target for short sellers. The company also reset 2019 and 2020 targets to reflect a restructuring plan aimed at rebuilding brand value, reducing reliance on discounts, cutting costs and cleaning up inventory in the wholesale channels.
The results and management’s plan “should provide some partial relief despite the likelihood of consensus earnings downgrades”, said Citigroup. 
Sellside stories
● Berenberg upgraded Wm Morrison to “buy” with a 285p target price ahead of the Competition and Markets Authority’s decision on the proposed J Sainsbury-Asda merger. The broker assumed that while the CMA was unlikely to block the deal outright, its definition of competition may exclude some discount chains and require the combined group to make up to 180 store disposals. Sainsbury can still make the economics of the merger work with fewer than 200 store disposals, it argued.
“Sainsbury and Asda’s owner Walmart have very strong financial and strategic incentives to complete the deal. As a result, some stores could be sold at a significant discount to market prices . . . We identify Waitrose and Morrison as the key beneficiaries of store disposals (eligible buyers for 65 per cent and 35 per cent of stores respectively).”
Berenberg
The broker assumed Morrison would buy between 30 and 50 stores from the combined Asda-Sainsbury, implying a 15 per cent boost to earnings per share. “If the merger is approved, all three listed UK food retailers — Tesco, Sainsbury and Morrison — become very appealing equity investments,” it added.
● Investec reinstated “buy” advice on Metro Bank. in the wake of last month’s warning that it had put the wrong risk weightings on property loans. The resultant sell-off has morphed Metro into a lender with a normal valuation and an abnormal growth outlook, Investec argued.
Investec saw Metro’s capital ratio as likely to be inadequate for future growth unless it gained within the next two quarters a licence to use the Advanced Internal Rating-Based (AIRB) approach, which allows banks to use their own models to estimate required capital for credit risk. It assumed no AIRB accreditation before the first half of 2020, around six months later than the company’s own target. 
Slowing loan growth in the meantime would be “somewhat unpalatable given its existing plan to deliver further rapid improvement in operational leverage, a function of balance sheet growth”, said Investec. “We think a fresh capital raise is likely and, for now, we model £300m with the first-half 2019 results in July. But Metro could yet choose to get it done and move as soon as February 27.”
Investec added: “By definition, a story predicated on rapid growth to drive improving operational leverage is subject to significant forecast error; it is higher risk.” But with Metro shares trading at 0.7 times 2023 book value and returning 14 per cent on tangible equity, the stock was a speculative buy up to a £16.50 target, Investec said.
● In brief: ALD cut to “hold” at Deutsche Bank; Befimmo downgraded to “sell” at Société Générale; C&amp;C downgraded to “sell” at Berenberg; Campari cut to “underperform” at Bernstein; Cofinimmo downgraded to “sell” at Société Générale; Cobham raised to “hold” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Colonial downgraded to “sell” at Société Générale; CYBG rated new “hold” at Deutsche Bank; Fortum downgraded to “reduce” at HSBC; Greencore rated new “buy” at Jefferies; Greene King upgraded to “hold” at Goodbody; Immofinanz cut to “sell” at Société Générale; JD Wetherspoon downgraded to “hold” at Goodbody; Lundin Petroleum downgraded to “hold” at HSBC; Merlin Properties cut to “hold” at Société Générale; Mitchells &amp; Butlers raised to “buy” at Goodbody; Novozymes upgraded to “buy” at Berenberg; Orpea raised to “buy” at Kepler Cheuvreux; Sartorius upgraded to “hold” at HSBC; Segro downgraded to “hold” at Société Générale; Société Foncière raised to “hold” at Société Générale; Shurgard downgraded to “sell” at Société Générale; Sika rated new “underweight” at Morgan Stanley; Sunrise Communications cut to “equal-weight” at Barclays; Umicore downgraded to “underweight” at Barclays.

171,UK should follow Europe’s example and bar retail merger,Proposed Sainsbury’s-Asda plan an opportunity for the CMA’s chairman to show his teeth,https://www.ft.com/content/6b8ce236-f974-11e8-a154-2b65ddf314e9,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-08T20:21:44Z,"Any day now, the Competition and Markets Authority will reveal whether it has decided to approve the most blatant attempt to trample on the rules in a key industry that the UK has yet seen.
Put like that, barring the proposed merger between J Sainsbury and Asda looks like a simple decision. It presents an early opportunity for the CMA’s chairman Andrew Tyrie to show his teeth and stop this clear cut in competition in food retailing.
The wannabe partners would rather he did not see it like that, arguing that Sainsda would be barely bigger than Tesco, and look how those beastly Germans from Aldi and Lidl are eating our lunch! We really need to merge, and we’ll sell off dozens, hundreds of stores if you let us. We’ll even make some uncheckable promises about lower prices in the shops.
This is so much chop suey. Sainsbury’s is starting “from a position of weakness” as Clive Black of Shaw Capital puts it. A merger is a diversion from its everyday ills, while Asda’s US parent Walmart sees its future in America. It is a thin case for banging the two behemoths together, even if the “lower prices” mantra were true.
Across the Channel EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager has just barred Europe’s two rail giants from forming a “European champion”. and please don’t call it a monopoly. Lord Tyrie might look there to see how these beasts should be handled, and stiffen his resolve to stop this ‘orrible merger. 
Look at the money we’re saving!
Another rail spike into the coffin being prepared for the wretched HS2: David Lidington, the number two in the UK government, would like to know how slowing down the trains would help to meet the timetable targets for the UK’s leading vanity project.
The line would slice through his Aylesbury constituency, which probably concentrated his mind to oppose it before he joined the May administration. Now he has become the second senior minister to question whether the misery that realising this overpriced fantasy would cause is really worth it. The report, in the Sunday Telegraph, of his intervention attracted 72 comments, all of them hostile to the project.
The case for building this line was flimsy from the start, and has morphed from saving time (not much, if the trains ran more slowly) to raising capacity, as its proponents desperately seek to justify the unjustifiable. The HS2ers have suddenly found “cost savings” at Euston and Old Oak Common, perhaps sensing the danger to the scheme.
Next we can expect to be told that we are “in blood stepped in so far . . . returning were as tedious as go o’er”. History tells us that this argument is nearly always false. Every careful analysis, from the National Audit Office to parliamentary inquiries, has concluded that HS2 is a waste of public money, and that compared with the final cost, the billions sunk so far are merely a rounding error.
Building a proper connection between Lancashire and Yorkshire instead would cost far less and self-evidently benefit the north. It’s time Mr Lidington pulled rank on the hapless Chris Grayling, and told the transport secretary to derail this wealth-destroying project.
Gross returns from fund management
A bright young thing does not generally go into fund management to make owners of capital rich. The metric that matters most is the size of the sum he controls, not whether he can turn the saver’s pound into two.
It is some time since Bill Gross qualified as a bright young thing, but age has shown clearly the winners in this industry. It is nearly five years since the “bond king” moved with great fanfare to Janus Henderson. Since then his magnificently-named Global Unconstrained Bond Fund has turned $10,000 into, er, $10,224.
The fund’s website betrays where the money has been made on his watch. The annual expense ratios for the seven (count ‘em) classes of share vary between 0.69 and 1.79 per cent, and there is $950m in the fund. You do the math, as they say.
Gabriel Altbach, founder of consultancy Asset Management Insights, told FTFM: “The industry owes Bill Gross a giant debt of gratitude”. The punters who put up the money might think they have paid it.

WASHINGTON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Jeff Bezos, chief executive of Amazon.com Inc, has accused the owner of the National Enquirer of trying to blackmail him with the threat of publishing ""intimate photos"" he allegedly sent to his girlfriend unless he said in public that the supermarket tabloid's reporting on him was not politically motivated.
The accusation, published in a blog post, is the latest twist in a weeks-long saga that has brought the world's richest person's private life into the spotlight and thrusts him deeper into a battle with the leading U.S. tabloid publisher, which has had close links with the president of the United States.
""Of course I dont want personal photos published, but I also wont participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks, and corruption,"" Bezos wrote. ""I prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out.""
American Media Inc (AMI), the owner of the National Enquirer, did not immediately return a request for comment.
Bezos and his wife announced last month that they were divorcing after 25 years of marriage, following a period of ""loving exploration"" and trial separation. That same day, the National Enquirer touted it was publishing alleged intimate text messages between Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, a former television anchor whom he was said to be dating.
Shortly after that, Bezos opened an investigation into the leak led by Gavin de Becker, a longtime security consultant and former appointee of U.S. President Ronald Reagan. De Becker proceeded to tell media that the leak was politically motivated.
Bezos, Amazon and the newspaper he owns privately, the Washington Post, have all been targets of attacks on Twitter by U.S. President Donald Trump.
The Washington Post has published many articles critical of the president. It acts as Amazon's ""chief lobbyist,"" Trump has said on Twitter, without presenting evidence. Trump called Bezos ""Jeff Bozo"" in a tweet last month about the National Enquirer's coverage of his divorce.
""Its unavoidable that certain powerful people who experience Washington Post news coverage will wrongly conclude I am their enemy,"" Bezos wrote. ""President Trump is one of those people, obvious by his many tweets.""
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In his blog, Bezos cited an email from AMI deputy general counsel, Jon Fine, to a lawyer representing de Becker. In it, AMI proposed a public acknowledgment from Bezos and de Becker that ""they have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that (AMI's) coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.""
In return for such an acknowledgement, according to the email, AMI offered ""not to publish, distribute, share, or describe unpublished texts and photos.""
Bezos said the statement AMI was proposing was false and described the offer as an ""extortionate proposal.""
Fine and de Becker could not immediately be reached for comment.
The alleged extortion raises questions among some legal observers about whether AMI and its chief executive David Pecker have violated a cooperation agreement AMI made last year with federal prosecutors in connection with a $150,000 hush-money payment given to Karen McDougal, the Playboy model who claims she had an affair with President Donald Trump.
The payment was made during the 2016 presidential election to influence that election, according to the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY). The deal not to prosecute was conditional on AMI not committing another crime, the office said.
A spokesman for the SDNY attorney's office declined to comment on the matter.
Bezos, who owns more than $120 billion in Amazon stock, said in his blog: ""If in my position I cant stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can?""

The company filed for a confidential IPO on Monday.
Two sources said Slack is only HIPAA compliant for file uploads, and not yet for direct messaging. But that's expected in the coming months.
Christina Farr
Slack, the messaging and chat application for businesses, appears to be setting itself up for the $3.5 trillion health care market.
Slack, which confidentially filed to go public Monday, recently updated its security page to note that it is HIPAA compliant, suggesting that it is working towards a use case where health care providers can begin using it to share sensitive patient health information.
Two people who have talked to Slack about the certification said the compliance only currently extends to file uploads, and not for direct messaging or channel communication between health providers. Both the people, who work at health start-ups, said that Slack told them it's working to expand its scope to include messaging in the coming months. The sources declined to comment publicly to preserve their business relationship with Slack.
Slack noted via Twitter that only the enterprise version of the product, Slack Enterprise Grid, is HIPAA compliant. The company did not comment further.
Since Slack released its product in 2013, several start-ups have emerged claiming to be the ""Slack for health care messaging."" One of them, called Stitch, is pitching hospitals on a product that can provide an easy way for patients to check in and receive messages from the front desk. That product is also used by physicians and nurses to share labs, scans, and other health information as they work to treat a patient.
Stitch positions itself as taking on an $11 billion market (hospitals waste roughly that amount every year due to communication breakdowns), which points to the size of the market opportunity for Slack.
But the major thing that stood in its way is HIPAA compliance, which applies to ""covered entities"" including health plans and providers. HIPAA is a set of federal rules and requirements designed to protect patient information.
Slack might have an edge over these smaller competitors, as many physician practices and hospitals already use it for administrative matters that don't touch on specific patient cases.
Slack isn't the only business-to-business company to explore opportunities in health care. Dropbox, Box and others have also added compliance to their offerings to move into the $3.5 trillion market.
""As more and more of healthcare moves to the cloud, there is a massive opportunity for new tools and platforms to deliver a better experience for healthcare professionals and patients,"" said Box CEO Aaron Levie.
""It's exciting to see Slack support HIPAA compliance and expand into this space.""

Tyson, one of the biggest food companies in the U.S. by sales, supplies meat to restaurants and other food-service customers. It also sells branded chicken, beef, and pork under labels like Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Golden Island Jerky.
The deal talks come just months after Tyson closed its $2.16 billion acquisition of McDonald's meat supplier Keystone Foods, which further expanded its capabilities in Asia.
An acquisition of a U.S. brand like Foster Farms, which makes products like branded chicken, turkey and frozen foods, would therefore mark a mild change in course for Tyson. It would instead echo a strategy it pursued in 2014, with its $7.7 billion acquisition of Hillshire Brands, which brought with it Jimmy Dean sausages and Ball Park hot dogs.
Tyson executives were asked about their global M&amp;A strategy during the company's November earnings call. Of particular concern to one analyst was international expansion in the context of geopolitical uncertainty and currency fluctuations.
In response, CEO Noel White said, ""We're forecasting about 90% of the growth in global protein demand will take place outside the United States. We do plan to participate in that demand growth.... My priority is no different than .. .my predecessors [which have been] ... to grow our business in prepared foods, value-added products and in the international market, simultaneously working to provide stability with more of the commodity portions of our business.""
White took over as CEO on Sept. 30, 2018, after serving as Tyson's group president of beef, pork and international.
Foster Farms was founded in in 1939 by Max and Verda Foster. It owns farms in California and Louisiana, and also works with 30 family-owned farms in Washington and Oregon. In 2016, it named Laura Flanagan its CEO, taking over for Ron Foster, grandson of the company's founder.
Tyson, founded in 1935 by John W. Tyson, generated roughly $40 billion in sales last fiscal year. Shares of the company, which has a market capitalization of $18 billion, are down 15 percent over the past year.
The people requested anonymity because the talks are confidential. Tyson said it does not comment on rumors or speculation. A spokesperson for Foster Farms did not respond to requests for comment.

175,CNBC'S ALEX SHERMAN: YELP HIRES EVERCORE FOR ACTIVIST DEFENSE AFTER HEDGE FUND CALLS FOR SALE OF COMPANY AND BOARD OVERHAUL,,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/06/cnbcs-alex-sherman-yelp-hires-evercore-for-activist-defense-after-hedge-fund-calls-for-sale-of-company-and-board-overhaul.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-06T21:21:00Z,"Yelp has hired Evercore to help defend itself from activist investor SQN, who last month called for a board skake-up and potential sale of the company.
SQN says Yelp has missed investor expectations in 12 of the last 19 quarters.
The hedge fund has urged shareholders to replace three of Yelp's eight directors when they come up for re-election this year.
Alex Sherman
Yelp, the review site for restaurants and local businesses, has hired Evercore to help defend the company against an activist investor, who recently called for a board shake-up and potential sale, according to people familiar with the matter.
Hedge fund manager SQN, which owns 4 percent of Yelp shares, released a presentation on Jan. 16, about the company's ""significant underperformance,"" and said that based on its own research ""an immediate sale to a private equity firm could yield a $47 to $50 stock price."" The shares are currently trading at $37.59.
Yelp co-founder and CEO Jeremy Stoppelman and the board have now tapped Evercore to work with the company and explore the market, but the bank hasn't started running a sales process, said the people, who asked not to be named because the matter is confidential. At the current market valuation of over $3 billion, there are few, if any, ""credible buyers,"" one of the people said.
Representatives from Yelp and Evercore declined to comment.
SQN's report suggests that the company is worth $4 billion or more. But SQN, a technology-focused hedge fund with more than $1.1 billion in assets, is a virtual unknown in the world of activist investing, where Carl Icahn, Bill Ackman and Daniel Loeb are among the most recognizable and influential players. Yelp is SQN's first activist investment.
Yelp has struggled to fend off competition from Google, which is both the largest search engine and a rival in the reviews market. Google reviews and Instagram photos of food and restaurants have given consumers new ways to find recommendations for restaurants.
Yelp has also lagged behind other companies that offer tools and technology to measure the effectiveness of ad spend, and has failed to keep up with Google's local discovery features, SQN claimed in its investor presentation.
Shares of Yelp have plunged by more than half over the past five years and are down 15 percent in the past 12 months. SQN said that Yelp has underperformed the Russell 2000 Technology Index by 117 percent and its own peer group by about 74 percent over the last half-decade.
Yelp has been on the M&amp;A market in the past. The company hiredGoldman Sachs to run a sales process in 2015. That effort ended when Stoppelman decided not to move forward despite having several interested buyers, people familiar with the matter said at the time.
The Evercore-led process could end up with the company looking for a buyer, especially if Yelp shares were to fall, sources told CNBC. Yelp hasn't made any decisions about selling this time around, the people said.
SQN said in an email to CNBC that it knows of ""multiple buyers"" that would be interested in buying Yelp.
Here's the firm's full statement.
As we made clear in our detailed presentation released in January, SQN believes there are multiple pathways to significant value creation at Yelp, including through the company remaining public and implementing our recommendations, or through a sale of the company to a large universe of private or strategic buyers. We are unclear on how anyone could credibly state that potential buyers don't exist without having run a fulsome strategic process. As we've previously stated, we know of multiple buyers who would be interested, and we believe these potential acquirers would be eager to participate in such a process.

Christine Curry was the subject of a magazine profile about treating pregnant women in South Florida with the Zika virus.
Apple CEO Tim Cook has said that improving health will be the company's greatest contribution to mankind.
Christina Farr
Apple's health team has hired an obstetrician, Dr. Christine Curry, to look into how the company can bolster its efforts in women's health, among other projects, according to three people familiar with the hire.
Apple CEO Tim Cook has described health care as a growing priority and a major part of Apple's legacy. He told CNBC's Jim Cramer in January, ""If you zoom out into the future, and you look back, and you ask the question, 'What was Apple's greatest contribution to mankind?' It will be about health.""
Apple has hired dozens of doctors to work across a variety of projects, including its so-called ""AC Wellness clinics"" for Apple employees and its health-tracking Apple Watch. Curry has a particular interest in women's health, but she'll be working on various issues across the health teams, one of the people said.
According to her LinkedIn profile, Curry is affiliated with Kaiser Permanente in Redwood City, California. She has not updated her profile to reflect that she works at Apple, although that's not uncommon given the value that Apple places on secrecy.
Apple declined to comment. Curry did not respond to an inquiry.
Studies have found that women's health companies have historically struggled to raise funding. It's also often an overlooked area, including briefly by Apple when the company first launched its HealthKit service in 2015 and claimed to offer ""comprehensive"" health tracking but did not include reproductive health. It quickly rectified that with a service called Apple Reproductive Health, adding features for menstruation, ovulation test results, basal body temperature and more (still, that service has been critiqued in reviews for being a little challenging to use.)
Since then, there's been an explosion of health apps from third-party developers that are geared to women, such as apps for tracking fertility, connecting with a doctor and so on. But Apple could do even more when it comes to women's health, both in hardware and software, in areas like pregnancy, fertility tracking and improving diversity in clinical research.
Curry's online profile notes that she worked in a women's prison facility in Massachusetts, and led a clinical response effort to the Zika virus in the obstetrics populations at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. That made her South Florida's go-to doctor for pregnant women with Zika, which earned her a profile in Cosmopolitan.
Apple Watch competitor Fitbit is also looking into women's health, and has an advisor that engages with its community, Dr. Katherine White, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Boston University. When Fitbit released its new women's health, the company referred to it in a blog post as one of its community's ""most requested features.""

Gimlet, a Brooklyn-based startup, is behind popular shows like Reply All and Crimetown. More recently, the company has moved toward TV production, including its scripted podcast Homecoming, which will become an Amazon TV show starring Julia Roberts.
Recode reports that although the deal is in its advance stages, the purchase is not finalized just yet. Acquiring Gimlet would be the first time Spotify has bought a content company; furthermore, it would be the biggest podcast deal in the industry, passing Apple which has been a majority holder of podcasts.
In 2017, Gimlet raised $22 million in funding, and was said to be valued at around $70 million that August. Spotify would pay more than $200 million in cash for the company, according to the report.
Podcasts have seen rapid growth recently, bringing in an estimated $315 million in ad revenue in 2017, up 86% from the year prior, according to Interactive Advertising Bureau. True crime podcast Serial set a new record in September with nearly 3 million downloads."

Hours after the Amazon founder published a post to Medium accusing AMI, of threatening to publish racy photos of him and his girlfriend if he didnt stop investigating them, journalist Ronan Farrow claimed he and another journalist received similar threats.
Farrow wrote on Twitter late Thursday that he and at least one other prominent journalist were the recipients of such threats after reporting on the Enquirers relationship with President Donald Trump. 
I and at least one other prominent journalist involved in breaking stories about the National Enquirers arrangement with Trump fielded similar ‘stop digging or well ruin you’ blackmail efforts from AMI, wrote Farrow. (I did not engage as I dont cut deals with subjects of ongoing reporting.) he added.
Farrow has written a number of stories about AMIs catch and kill practice, in which the publisher buys stories that it then buries. In many cases, such a practice was used to benefit Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign.
CNN reporter Brian Stelter shared a statement by AMI on Twitter Friday, detailing the publishers response to Bezos allegations. It said that American Media believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos but will nevertheless promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims. AMI promised to take whatever appropriate action is necessary upon completion of the investigation."

182,NFL Bullish About $25 Billion Revenue Goal Ahead of Super Bowl,"The NFL generated about $15 billion this past season, making it the king of U.S. sports.",http://fortune.com/2019/02/02/nfl-super-bowl-ad-revenue/,"{'id': 'fortune', 'name': 'Fortune'}",2019-02-02T18:04:08Z,"NFL executive Brian Rolapp has an old photo on the wall of his office, hanging right in his line of sight. It shows a group of prep-school football fans so captivated by a game that they ignore a building engulfed in flames behind them.
Without exaggeration, it sits in a place where I look at it every day, said Rolapp, the chief media and business officer for the National Football League.
For years, pro football has inspired that kind of passion in millions of fans. The NFL generated about $15 billion this past season, making it the king of U.S. sports. And the league is about to lean even harder on its fans, aiming to boost its annual revenue to $25 billion by 2027. That may test the limits of a sport grappling with shifting TV habits and controversies surrounding brain injuries and the national anthem.
But tailwinds could help the NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell achieve their growth targets. The spread of legalized sports betting across the U.S. promises to lock in fans and keep them riveted to games. Tech companies like Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc., meanwhile, have emerged as bidders for big-dollar broadcast packages.
Rogers aspirational target of $25 billion is starting to look pretty good, said Marc Ganis, a sports consultant who advises the NFL and a number of its owners on business strategies.
According to the league, NFL regular-season games, excluding those played in London, averaged 15.8 million viewers. Moreover, 45 of the top 50 telecasts this season were NFL games. The AFC championship — won by the New England Patriots, who face the Los Angeles Rams in the Super Bowl on Sunday — drew almost 54 million viewers. Thats more than double the number of people who watched the Macys Thanksgiving Parade or the 2018 Oscars.
Theres nothing left in media that will aggregate that many people, Rolapp said.
Just how valuable NFL games are to the broadcast networks and digital newcomers like Amazon and Facebook will determine whether the commissioner hits his revenue target.
The NFL reaps about $5 billion a year from its TV contracts with CBS, NBC, Fox and ESPN. All indications are that the league will get a lot more when the contracts expire after the 2021-2022 season.
In November, Major League Baseball signed an extension of its TV contract with Fox Sports, which agreed to pay $5 billion over seven years, a 36 percent annual average increase.
50 Percent
Ganis, the consultant, said the NFL will do much better. He expects the leagues next TV deals to yield increases in excess of 50 percent. On top of that, he expects a new billion-dollar package of games will go to a digital distributor such as Amazon, which currently pays $50 million a year to show Thursday Night Football. Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos personally held talks with Goodell about the Thursday night package, which helped the league boost online viewing by 86 percent.
Online executives arent the only ones clamoring for a tie-up with the most visible and valuable U.S. sports league.
When Papa Johns International Inc. and the league ended their relationship after the companys former CEO blamed player protests for sliding sales, it took the NFL just 24 hours to announce a new, bigger deal with Yum Brands Inc.s Pizza Hut.
New Sponsors
More widely, the NFL has added seven new leaguewide partners since January, including its first casino partner, Caesars Entertainment Corp., and its first presenting sponsor for the conference title games, Intuit Inc. The NFL and its clubs brought in a record $1.32 billion in sponsorship in 2017-2018, according to consulting firm IEG, significantly more than the National Basketball Association or Major League Baseball. That doesnt count the leagues newest partners, including home-improvement giant Lowes Cos., which chose the NFL after exiting a 17-year relationship with Nascar.
Lets face it: The NFL is dominant, Lowes Chief Marketing Officer Jocelyn Wong said. Its the largest, most avid fan base. That was very important to us.
Every summer, by virtue of an odd semipublic ownership structure, the Green Bay Packers disclose their shared and local revenue — a glimpse into the financial health of the league.
For the 2017-2018 season, the NFL divvied up $8.1 billion among its 32 teams, a 5 percent jump from 2016 — despite declining TV ratings and continued criticism from President Donald Trump over players kneeling during the national anthem. The Packers total revenue has increased every year since 2003.
Sports Betting
The prospect of widespread legalized sports betting in the U.S. will only buoy the ability of leagues to make money.
When — not if — the NFL embraces the U.S. sports betting market, the money will flow. The league should see an annual revenue increase of $2.3 billion, more than the combined estimate for MLB ($1.1 billion), the NBA ($585 million) and the National Hockey League ($216 million), according to the American Gaming Association.
Rolapp says the NFL, advertisers and networks have done research, tracking peoples eyes while they watch games.
The conclusion was familiar: Like the football fans in his photo, theyre so focused on the screen that they probably wouldnt notice a fire either."

184,Snap stems declines and beats revenue forecasts,Messaging app user numbers stabilised in fourth quarter,https://www.ft.com/content/5e68b4a4-2985-11e9-a5ab-ff8ef2b976c7,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-05T21:14:52Z,"Snap, the parent of disappearing message app Snapchat, stemmed recent declines in users and beat revenue expectations in its fourth-quarter results, despite investor concern over growing competition from Instagram and recent management upheaval. 
The Los Angeles-based company posted a 36 per cent rise in revenues in the fourth quarter of 2018 to $390m, beating analyst estimates of about $379m. Net losses nearly halved compared with the same quarter the prior year, to $192m. 
Snap lost several million users earlier last year in the wake of an unpopular redesign of its app, while Facebook-owned Instagram gained popularity with its rival Stories feature. However, Snap said that daily active users were flat in the fourth quarter at 186m, stabilising after two consecutive quarters of declines. 
“We are substantially closer to achieving profitability, as we have maintained a relatively flat cost structure across the past five quarters while growing full-year revenue 43 per cent year-over-year,” said Evan Spiegel, Snap’s chief executive. 
The company also said that it had begun to roll out a long-awaited update to its Android app, which has been more than a year in the making. Mr Spiegel had previously blamed the weakness of the Android app for the third quarter’s decline in users.
The group said that the new app had now been rolled out to “a small percentage” of users, and that early metrics were “promising”.
In its outlook, Snap said it expected first-quarter revenues of $285m to $310m, representing year-on-year growth of between 24 and 34 per cent. Snap expects adjusted losses before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation of between $140m and $165m, down from $218m in the same quarter last year.
The results cap off a tumultuous year for Snap that had continued into 2019. In particular, investors were unnerved after the group lost its second chief financial officer in 18 months in January, the latest in a string of high-profile departures. Tim Stone, a former Amazon executive, announced plans to leave just seven months into the job, after clashing with Mr Spiegel. 
Mr Spiegel said on Tuesday that the group had focused on “hiring the leadership team that will help us achieve our future goals”, pointing to the appointment of Jared Grusd, former chief executive of the Huffington Post, as its chief strategy officer, among others. It is yet to name a replacement for Mr Stone, but has appointed Lara Sweet, Snap’s former chief accounting officer, as an interim finance chief. 
Snap has also been battling legal woes. In November, the company said US authorities were investigating complaints that it misled investors ahead of its $3.4bn flotation about the challenge that Instagram presented to its future growth. The inquiries relate to a class-action lawsuit filed by some shareholders, which Snap has deemed “meritless”."

he called out stock analysts like Everscore ISI's Anthony DiClemente who have downgraded the equity over concerns about subscriber growth.
""I think this is lunacy,"" saidCramer, who has been bullish on the music streaming platform since it went public last April.""It's like the market just doesn't know how to read this company or its quarterly guidance. In my view, Spotify is very much on the right track.""
The stock was rocked after a seemingly mixed quarterly earnings released Wednesday, Cramer said. After Spotify reported lower-than-expected sales, tight cash flow and conservative guidance across the board including subscriber growth, shares sold below $129 at one point in Thursday's session.
But Cramer noted that the company beat expectations on operating profit and gross margin, which was 120 basis points higher than was asked for.
""I think the sellers were missing a lot of context here and the context is something I like to talk about a lot and it's called UPOD. They under promise ... and then they over deliver,"" he argued. ""At this point, CEO Daniel Ek and his team have established a track record of giving cautious guidanceunder promiseand then beating itover delivering.""
Spotify's guidance includes planned investment costs and the company could ""become the premier platform for podcasts,"" a hot market for hard-to-reach millennials, Cramer said.

Dunkin Brands Group Inc.s
chief information and strategy officer, said technology is playing a central role in upgrading the chain, known for its namesake donut shops and its Baskin-Robbins ice cream stores. Hes overseeing a $100 million test to outfit dozens of stores with new technology and a more modern design, and hes the driving force behind a transition to cloud services, both of which are aimed at helping the company stay competitive.
We want to refresh our image and make sure were continuing to be contemporary and relevant to our customers, said Mr. Clare, who joined Dunkin Brands in 2012 as chief information officer and became chief information and strategy officer in 2015.
Technology upgrades are becoming critical to decades-old retail brands, and information technology executives such as Mr. Clare are owning more of the corporate strategy. Mr. Clare added that hes also become the enabler of strategic marketing initiatives, which include in-store technologies and mobile ordering.
As of October 2018, the company had more than 60 restaurants outfitted with upgraded technologies, including cold-brew tap systems and high-tech espresso makers across the U.S., ahead of its initial target of 50. Mr. Clare has overseen the in-store technology upgrades since the initiative began over a year ago.
More than half of Dunkins $100 million investment, announced last year, is being spent on restaurant equipment such as new espresso machines, with part of the goal being to increase throughput in stores. The rest is going toward technology infrastructure and training, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.
Under Mr. Clares purview, the company also has transitioned much of its infrastructure to Amazon Web Services public cloud, beginning in 2017. Thats saved the company upwards of $1 million, in part because it reduced reliance on shared data centers, he said.
Instead of spending weeks or months provisioning hardware for technology projects, IT teams now can access services via the cloud in minutes or hours, he said. The company can use public cloud services to deploy new features to the mobile ordering app, for example, in weeks instead of months.
The time to market is orders of magnitude faster, Mr. Clare said.
The company declined to disclose metrics on how technology upgrades were impacting revenue. But plans for expanding the test beyond 60 stores are underway, Mr. Clare said.
Dunkin Donuts and Baskin-Robbins stores in the U.S. saw less traffic in its most recent quarter, but average ticket prices rose. Comparable sales at Dunkin Donuts locations in the U.S. rose 1.3% in the quarter ending Sept. 29, 2018, and overall sales for the companys most recent quarter rose 6% to $350 million, above consensus forecasts of $342.9 million, the Journal reported. The company is filing earnings on Feb. 7.
The first new-concept store opened in January 2018 in Quincy, Mass. At another upgraded store near Times Square in New York, remodeled last fall, franchisee co-owner Richard Greenstein said technology has positively influenced sales.
The store can serve more customers during peak hours because they can order ahead via a mobile app and know their order is ready by looking at an in-store digital display, Mr. Greenstein said. Lines have gotten shorter as a result, other store associates say. The stores new automatic espresso machine and cold-brew tap system also aim to entice customers that would otherwise pop into stores operated by coffeehouse competitors. 
The company also is looking to use new technologies such as artificial intelligence to increase personalization efforts. As of last October, 12% of Dunkin U.S. sales were from customers using the companys loyalty rewards program, which includes a mobile app and offerings that have been building over time since 2012. That means the company is beginning to learn more about customer behavior, including how many times each week they visit stores, what they order and what times of day they order, Mr. Clare said.
The next obvious leap is to anticipate behavior, using data analytics and artificial intelligence, but the company still needs to aggregate more data, Mr. Clare said. Its a pretty new concept for us. Theres nothing stopping us; were just trying to play catch-up with other forms of retail and consumer brands, he said.

189,A 'Shark Tank' entrepreneur swears by her stylish acupressure wrist bands,"Romy Taormina of Psi Bands pitches her stylish nausea-relief wrist bands on ""Shark Tank,"" seeking $250,000 in exchange for a 10 percent stake in her company.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/05/psi-bands-founder-six-years-after-shark-tank-get-comfortable-with-discomfort.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-05T20:00:00Z,"Battling nausea is far from a joy ride, which is why Romy Taormina made it her mission to create a solution for the uncomfortable experience without forfeiting fashion for function. Her products, Psi Bands, are stylish acupressure wrist bands she says help relieve nausea, including motion sickness, morning sickness, and nausea due to anesthesia and chemotherapy.
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
""I suffered from debilitating morning sickness during my pregnancies,"" Taormina said in an email to CNBC. ""The only thing that provided me with nausea and vomiting relief were acupressure wrist bands, but I was dissatisfied with existing products on the market. They were ugly, not waterproof so I could not wear them showering otherwise they'd get waterlogged ... ""
In 2013, Taormina went on ""Shark Tank,"" seeking $250,000 in exchange for 10 percent equity in her company. As she touted Psi Bands as products superior in function and fashion, the Sharks were growing more and more interested especially after learning her sales were $1 million in the 12 months prior.
Robert Herjavec was especially intrigued and even a little skeptical. The sales may have been high, but the net profit was considerably low, and the Sharks were concerned with how that could be the case.
Taormina mentioned other expenses, including overhead, rent, utilities, bookkeeping and debt. Her debt, specifically, added up to $600,000, which included past deferred salaries that she didn't take for the first four years.
""Are you saying that because you didn't pay yourself in the past, you consider that debt today? Herjavec asked.
Taormina said yes. To which Herjavec replied, ""Seriously?""
The idea of Taormina writing checks for unpaid work done years in the past wasn't appealing to the Sharks. These reactions, however, weren't a total shock to Taormina. As both a mother and entrepreneur, she said that she's learned to be comfortable with discomfort.
""One must not be complacent,"" Taormina said. ""Just when you think you have something dialed in, things change. The only thing constant is change. So, we all need to get comfortable with discomfort in business and life.""
Above all, Taormina said her experience on ""Shark Tank"" was highly stimulating. Since her appearance aired, Psi Bands has gained additional retailers, including Target, CVS, REI and Amazon. She said she has especially benefited from the networking among other ""Shark Tank"" entrepreneurs who are supportive of each other and share resources.
Will Taormina walk away with a deal? Find out on ""Shark Tank"" Tuesday at 8 p.m. ET on CNBC."

191,New York Beats Out San Francisco to Be World’s Best Tech City,A study by brokerage firms Savills Plc found New York ranked first on an index measuring 30 global tech cities.,https://content-service.bloomberg.com/articles/PMF22S6VDKHS,"{'id': 'bloomberg', 'name': 'Bloomberg'}",2019-02-05T15:36:25Z,"(Bloomberg)—Amazon.com Inc. might have the right idea: A new study shows New York City is the best place on the planet for technology.
New York ranked first in an index measuring 30 global tech-heavy cities analyzed by real estate brokerage Savills Plc, with San Francisco in second place and London third. New York pulled ahead thanks to its volume of venture capital cash, large pool of talent -- both homegrown and people attracted to the city -- and the opportunities that exist for them.
“So much of it is talent,” Paul Tostevin, author of the report, said from London. “New York can keep generating its own talent and, I think more importantly, recruiting it from around the world.”
Amazon in November unveiled plans to build an office hub in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens to accommodate 25,000 new employees. In its announcement, the internet retailer pointed to its desire for big populations of skilled workers to hire from. Google and Apple Inc. are also expanding in the city.
“Scale is something New York can offer when you’re employing so many people, so there’s a real advantage there for large tech companies,” said Tostevin, associate director of world research for the brokerage. “There’s that work-and-life balance that’s so important, and that New York can offer that is quite advantageous.”
It’s the first time in the report’s three iterations that New York came out on top. Austin, Texas, and San Francisco took the No. 1 and 2 spots, respectively, in both the 2015 and 2017 studies. The Savills index scores cities on the costs of living and doing business, investment opportunities, real estate prices and access to transit, among other things.
New York got points for its venture capital investment, which was billions of dollars greater than in San Francisco over the past three years, according to the report. That and plentiful transportation options helped offset the city’s poor score for real estate costs, Tostevin said. New York’s rents for offices -- including co-working space -- and housing are among the highest, according to Savills.

The following is the unofficial transcript of a CNBC EXCLUSIVE interview with Spotify Co-Founder and CEO on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" (M-F 9AM 11AM) today, Wednesday, February 6th. The following is a link to video of the interview on CNBC.com: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/02/06/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-spotify-ceo-daniel-ek.html.
All references must be sourced to CNBC.
JIM CRAMER: All right. Spotify, I'm a big user. David's a big user. I know Carl is as well.
DAVID FABER: Yes, we are as well.
JIM CRAMER: They just bought two podcasts. Company is also out with earnings. It was a nice beat this morning. And this is a big, special exclusive interview for us. We're quite excited about this Spotify's Co-Founder and CEO Daniel Ek, right here, post nine. Daniel, I've got to ask you, right upfront, podcasts: I understand they're red hot and what we want is an aggregator. I didn't think that a music company would do it, but I do think that an audio company would do it. And hat's what this is about, isn't it?
DANIEL EK: Yeah, it is really about expanding our mission from just being about music to being about all of audio and being the world's leading audio platfor. And what we are seeing, really is -- we have done podcasts for two years. It is -- our users are listening to podcasts are listening to the platform almost twice as much. And, of course, the growth in podcasts for us has just been phenomenal. And that's part of the reason why we're now making this move.
JIM CRAMER: I would also imagine that podcasts are a gateway drug for the rest of your products.
DANIEL EK: Indeed, yeah. I mean, great example would be we had in the fourth quarter Amy Schumer and Joe Budden on the platform. Those are all appealing to very different types of audiences who are now trying Spotify for the first time and noticing all the benefits that the platform has.
JIM CRAMER: Now, you've got a Netflix lineage. We've got Barry McCarthy, the CFO who is quite -- let's say he's pertinent or germane on the conference call and he says things that I think are a little unusual. But yuou use algorithms, you always seem to know for instance, we use Spotify at our restaurants, we always we're never worried, you always seem to know what we want. How is that possible?
DANIEL EK: Well, it is really all down to the team of both editors and the machine learning team that we have at Spotify. And we're looking at more than 16,000 signals every single day as we look at your taste profile and try to rank you the things you like the most. So I'm glad that that's working well in the product.
DAVID FABER: You know, there have been those who thought that podcast was a fad. Why would we go back to something like talk radio? You're finding it is not. The listening patterns are consistent. Is there real growth in the potential audience, though, as well?
DANIEL EK: Well, the growth has been really spectacular for us. And just shy of two years we have become the second biggest podcasting platform. The types of experiences that we're seeing podcaster doing is vastly different than just the normal talk show radio. There is literally shows like Serial, which is drama that is acted out, and there is kids' shows that are now coming, including news, The Daily, being great examples of podcasts that are doing very, very well.
DAVID FABER: Your investors, however, may look at your stock today, down a bit and also sort of wonder about the long-term, which I know you're thinking about. You know, one question I got from a number of people who owned the stock for a while, what about long-term guidance on your margins? Which I think you said it was between 30 and 35% at some point. Does that hurt -- does this new effort hurt that long-term guidance on margins? And should they expect perhaps a different metric?
DANIEL EK: No. We're staying steady with our long-term margin goal. We never said that it would be a linear path to get there. But I think looking at it in our fourth quarter results you can see that the margin is going up. It is very strong. Our core business is very strong. What we're doing now in 2019, however, is we're investing in more original content on the platform. That will broaden the appeal. It will broaden the engagement, which of course is a virtual cycle that then grows the platform and leads to more profitability long-term.
JIM CRAMER: You know, I'm following you guys pretty closely and like your company ever since you became public. And one of the things I thought you would do is not get trapped by the four calls of the spreadsheet. I view you as Netflix, the more great content that you add, the more I want to own the stock. I don't really care, things happen as Barry McCarthy said in terms of the range today. Why are you trapping yourself? Why are you not going with something which just says, you know what, we got a Netflix idea here, Mr. McCarthy is from Netflix, we understand the more content we add, give us a chance, don't look at this as a snapshot, if you want to know the key metric, advertising, going to premium, is what we care about. Why did you revert to traditional guidance when your company is bigger than that?
DANIEL EK: Well, I mean, again, we have always strived to be a very transparent company and we do give a lot of detailed numbers on the guidance. And obviously this is a new business line for us. But I think the way in looking at the potential of the business, it is very much more to be said. We are investing in more original content that will broaden the appeal of the platform. And as we're doing that, we believe obviously subscriber, engagement will go up which increases our long-term opportunity.
DAVID FABER: We know what Netflix spends a year to acquire content. It's nothing like where you are, I mean, we're talking 12, $15 billion a year. But can you give us some sense of what your expectations are in terms of how much you will spend to acquire this original content?
DANIEL EK: Yeah, I mean, again, it is really right now from a very low base. But I don't think it is unlikely that it is Netflix type of story than if the magnitude of the numbers won't be the same, of us doubling that investment year over year to get more and more content.
DAVID FABER: So you do see yourself doubling potentially how much you're putting towards original content, which would typically come in the form of podcasts, I guess, or of audio as opposed to --
DANIEL EK: Yeah. Exactly. We're definitely investing a lot more in getting more original content on to the service and you should expect that going forward. And as long as we're seeing cost of engagement numbers, the content, we're investing in, you should expect this to make those investments.
JIM CRAMER: it's funny. I like the Apple service revenue stream. And when I saw it, I know this company, the big one, it's a Brooklyn company, so I followed Brooklyn companies because I lived there, I was hoping that Apple would make this acquisition. The reason I say that is because people don't -- unless you listen to the podcasts, they are very millennial, and they are very much the way people multitask now. Do you see yourself buying all of them that are left, so that I know if I want -- that you become synonymous in podcast?
DANIEL EK: I don't think we have to buy all of the companies that are in this space. There is a tremendous a lot of these companies. What we feel very strongly about is we want to be in the game, we want to be the platform that these creators come to and go to. And, again, as you mentioned, I would say -- we're very much focused on being audio video is a huge space. It has the attention of everyone right now. But we think audio being almost two hours of consumption per day is a massive opportunity that no one is really paying attention to.
JIM CRAMER: Wow 
DAVID FABER: You said you have line of sight, sorry, Jim, on 4 to 5 million on multiple acquisitions this year. And then you just said that may double, am I correct? So it could be as much as a billion in 2020?
DANIEL EK: Not really in terms of just acquisitions. What I was talking about our content investments that we're making. So part of what you should look in terms of our going forward forecast is both acquisitions, but then it's also our own efforts in investing in creating these shows. We had 14 exclusive shows in the fourth quarter of 2018. We're doubling down on that. And we want to grow the number of shows that we have.
JIM CRAMER: I am so impressed with the subscribers by region. It's something that you originally told me, your company told me could happen. Just gonna go 30% North America. Latin America, 20%. Rest of world 10. You're pretty much, year-end here, you're up 40%. Does podcast, do they fly in every region?
DANIEL EK: Yes. You would be surprised. It has grown very, very fast. Germany is a great example. We're already there. The number one player of kids shows right now, so you see young consumers are going to bed with Spotify, listening to stories in a big, big way. So, even the perception in Germany wouldn't be that Spotify is just about music, it is really all about audio already.
JIM CRAMER: So this is important because when I watch Netflix, I never watch it in dubbed. I always watch it -- you have to watch the titles, it is a different show than if you listen. Will you translate everybody's great stuff for United States?
DANIEL EK: I think there is definitely that opportunity of taking the shows that are working really well in these different geographies and translating them across the world.
DAVID FABER: What about the car? Do you have a sense as to how many people are listening to you in an automobile?
DANIEL EK: Yeah. I mean, we're doing very, very well in the car. I think last number we gave out is that there is more than 50 million of our users who are using Spotify in the car. So it is definitely a big part of our business.
DAVID FABER: And do you -- do you have any sense the growth of that? Obviously there is competition in the car in the form of Sirius, which many people know, but even beyond that, some of the others. Is it growing substantially?
DANIEL EK: It is growing really, really substantially. I think the number one metric that we look at is dual platforms. How many of our users are using it on more than one platform? And what we're seeing is that that number is increasing dramatically as more speakers come into play, as cars are getting more and more connected. So it is really a big part of our story. The other thing that we see is those people are more than twice as engaged as the average user as well. So it is an important part of our overall story.
DAVID FABER: When you look at the competitive landscape, Daniel, obviously you were early, you sort of -- in the days of piracy, you transformed and really streaming, you've been the leader. But Apple is out there with a product. We don't talk very often about it. Amazon. They're both incredibly deep pocketed companies. Do you believe if they wanted to that they conceivably could spend enough money to push you out of your leading market position?
DANIEL EK: I mean, these are formidable companies. No doubt. But what I look at is obviously how our business is doing and we had a phenomenal Q4. The other part that I look at is we're really just focused on audio. That's how you should look at this. There is a ton of things that these other companies are doing, self-driving cars, whatever other businesses they're into. And I believe in this day and age that you need to be very, very clear with your brand, what you are for consumers, in order for them to take it up. And the best experience wins. And now we're adding the best content to that as well. And that's now Spotify.
JIM CRAMER: I don't know whether you're familiar with Tien Tzuo's work from Zuora, but the subscription economy and subscriber's, it's a great book, he always says 'Watch churn.' Churn shows you loyalty. You've got some of the stickiest churn I've ever seen.
DANIEL EK: Yeah. And it is trending as you can see, the churn is decelerating.
JIM CRAMER That's positive we should tell people that that's good.
DANIEL EK: Yeah, yeah. Churn is definitely decelerating which is a very positive metric that we're keeping track of. And of course, at the same time, you should look at the announcements that we're doing today as I mentioned, it broadens the appeal of Spotify, it increases the engagement. If it increases the engagement, we think it has the opportunity of also lowering churn even further.
JIM CRAMER: And how about Google?
DANIEL EK: Yes, Google is obviously the same category as I guess all of the other F.A.N.G. companies.
DAVID FABER: It wasn't that long ago that you guys went public. I remember it. I don't think you were actually even here at the time. You chose to list as opposed to raise capital. Are you happy with that decision?
DANIEL EK: I am. Indeed. It was obvious that a big decision for us to make, but it felt like the Spotify way of doing it. It wasn't just about doing it for the sake of everyone else doing it. And we've always said that we're a long-term thinking company, and I think we proved that with that move.
DAVID FABER: Tell me more, what does ""the Spotify way"" then mean? It just means doing it differently or the way you need to?
DANIEL EK: It's about being transparent and it is about, in this case, trying to align the incentives of everyone. And in our case, we didn't need to raise additional capital. And we wanted a way to provide not just our existing shareholders with liquidity, but also our employees. And that was an important part for me of avoiding that traditional lockup process for our employees.
DAVID FABER: And well, for the sake of transparency, we're very happy to have you, but sort of curious as to why you're suddenly communicating in this way. Can we expect to see more of you in this sort of a public setting, articulating some of the things you've just done here? Or is this going to kind of be a one-time only and we'll never see you again?
DANIEL EK: No, I certainly hope to be available and transparent. That's certainly what we want to be as a company. And I would encourage both of you or everyone else, by the way, to reach out to me on social platforms and I'm happy to respond to questions there as well. But I think this is obviously -- marks a shift in terms of people's perception what have this company is. And that it's very important for us to state very clearly why it is and that we're excited about this future.
JIM CRAMER: Let me go back to something that we wanted to drill down on -- sharing stuff. This Google. I didn't want Google to be a throwaway. The premium subscribers. Google Home promotion marked the first hardware bundle offer ever in history. This worked big for you. Are we going to see Amazon? Are we going to see -- who else do you do this with? Because to me this is premium, and premium is the way that I want to judge you.
DANIEL EK: Yeah. I mean, we have as a core part of our strategy we call Ubiquity, which is being on all platforms.
JIM CRAMER: Good.
DANIEL EK: So we've got 500 of these partnerships going, and obviously what we saw was our members were asking for these voice speakers. We saw a clear opportunity to provide that with an amazing experience. We saw that people who were already fans of the google assistance wanted the Spotify experience, so we'd be happy to extend that so Samsung, of course.
JIM CRAMER: Right.
DANIEL EK: And happy to work 
JIM CRAMER: Samsung's car, because can you do with Infotainment and do it with HARMAN.
DANIEL EK: Yes. Of course.
JIM CRAMER: What do you think of Facebook?
DANIEL EK: Facebook, again, is an exciting company. We have a long relationship with Facebook. If there are opportunities, we would love to work with them.
JIM CRAMER: So you don't mind what happened with Facebook in terms of the world -- you are a company driven by morality. You have no problem with Facebook.
DANIEL EK: No, look. I mean, at the end of the day we want to be where our users are.
JIM CRAMER: Fair enough.
DAVID FABER: Just getting back to many so of the financials and things that some of your investors care about. What are your expectations in terms of negotiations with the labels and what's going to actually occur there?
DANIEL EK: Well, our focus, and I believe that's their focus as well, is really about: how do we grow the entire music industry? I've said before on our earnings call that the focus for us in these round of negotiations is really about enabling the marketplace. And that's a crucial point because it isn't a point about them losing and us winning or taking the points of the margin here or there at their expense. It's really about getting rid of the inefficiencies that exist in the music industry by creating tools that make it easier for artists and fans to connect and making it easier for labels to market their, you know 
DAVID FABER: You have access to enormous amounts of data that conceivably would be helpful in terms of where people are listening, how they are listening and who they are listening to.
DANIEL EK: Exactly, including the 16,000 data points that we're gathering every single day through the taste profiles. That's a huge part that we're able to connect these two in a way where it's positive for users and really positive for artists as well.
JIM CRAMER: I don't want to be too Bobby Kennedy-like, but if we just think about now, no, but if we dream things the stickier you are, I'll go back to the churn, I mean, a lot of people looked at Netflix at $6.95, They said it's never going to be anything. I mean, when I see the low churn, I think that one day you could raise prices, that you're a little bit more stickier, and, therefore, we should be modeling higher prices down the road.
DAVID FABER: $14.99 is enough, I think.
JIM CRAMER: No, come on.
DAVID FABER: What do you think?
DANIEL EK: I mean, look, again, all I can say right now is we're in this growing the market phase. We're not in trying to capture all the profits side.
JIM CRAMER: David, take the commercial side. Go listen to the commercials if you have a problem with 14.
DAVID FABER: I think we need to get into the podcasting business is what I think.
JIM CRAMER: Daniel, it was great that you came on. I hope you come back again. Daniel Ek--
DANIEL EK: Yes. Thank you for having me.
JIM CRAMER: -- with an unbelievable company that people better start understanding, because they will want to only stock if they do rather than the ridiculous four walls that the analysts are coming with -- with the neutral. I'm not neutral.

194,NASA and NOAA: This is what the polar vortex looks like from space,Much of the country was draped in dangerous weather this week.,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/01/images-nasa-and-noaa-watching-polar-vortex-from-space.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-01T16:41:00Z,"Frosty temperatures pressed much of the country this week, thanks to Arctic temperatures ushered in by the polar vortex.
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
The deep freeze claimed at least 21 lives, suspended operations at General Motors plants, delayed some Amazon deliveries and grounded more than 1,500 flights.
It was a remarkable week of weather on the ground, and it looks that way from space too: Images captured by NASA and NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, are equal parts humbling and awe-inspiring.
The satellite image embedded above, from the NOAA Environmental Visualization Laboratory, shows rows of clouds over the Great Lakes. The image was taken on Sunday, Jan. 27.
""When extremely cold air moves over the unfrozen, relatively warmer lake water, columns of heated air begin to rise off the lake surface. As the rising, warmer air hits the cold air above it, the moisture condenses into cumulus clouds, then cools and sinks on either side,"" the NOAA explains about the image in a written statement. ""This rising and sinking motion creates parallel cylinders of rotating air that line up in the direction of the prevailing wind....""
""You can almost feel that cold in this natural-color image, acquired on January 27, 2019,"" NASA's website says about the image below. ""Cloud streets and lake-effect snow stretch across the scene, as frigid Arctic winds blew over the Great Lakes.""

A gif NOAA tweeted Thursday shows snow, clouds and ice clouds moving across the Great Lakes.
Lots of cool features in this morning's view from #GOESEast: Watch the clouds bringing lake effect snow change from liquid water (yellow) to ice (pink) as bitter cold air moved east across Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.
And another from Wednesday shows the snow as the sun comes up.
#GOESEast spotted snow on the ground as the sun rose on what will be a bitterly cold day across much of the U.S. A cold Arctic air mass is surging south into the upper Midwest before spreading across much of the eastern two-thirds of the country.
The cold temperatures are visible in this visual model from NASA's Earth Observatory. The image represents temperature by color at 4 a.m. EST on Jan. 29 at 6.5 feet above the ground, according to a statement from the NASA Earth Observatory.
Arctic weather is plunging into North America. The culprit is a familiar one: the polar vortex.
The model from NASA, below, shows the polar vortex moving from Canada across the Midwest of the United States from Jan. 20 through Jan. 29. In the image, purple represents the coldest temperatures. NASA uses a combination of two instruments to generate a ""three-dimensional map of atmospheric temperature and humidity, cloud amounts and heights, greenhouse gas concentrations and many other atmospheric phenomena,"" NASA says in a statement about the model.

195,The pit of vipers spits out another money-spinner,The latest White House tell-all promises to be neither sycophantic nor to ‘burn the place down’,https://www.ft.com/content/725b1688-288f-11e9-a5ab-ff8ef2b976c7,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-05T15:34:45Z,"It is the kind of free publicity first-time authors can only dream about. On the day of the publication of his White House memoir, Team of Vipers, Cliff Sims was sitting in the New York studios of CNN being interviewed live on air, when the host announced the president had just tweeted about Mr Sims, trashing him as a “low level staffer” and “gofer”, whose White House tell-all was simultaneously “fiction” but also violated Mr Sims’ non-disclosure agreement. Minutes later, a top Trump campaign official announced the campaign was preparing to file a suit against Mr Sims for the NDA violation. Ker-ching! 
Two and a half years ago, Mr Sims, a 30-something Alabama native, was a local conservative news outlet founder who was surprised that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump had agreed to do a local radio interview with him. Within 18 months he had graduated from radio interviewer, to Trump campaign staffer, to director for White House message strategy — a role that allowed him significant access to the president and, as he himself admits, would have been nigh impossible for someone like him to get in another administration.
When I catch up with Mr Sims on the phone a few days after the CNN interview, he is still trying to explain his reaction to the Trump tweet. Or rather his lack of reaction. 
“The thing that surprised me most about it is that I didn’t feel anything at all,” he insists. “I didn’t have any emotional reaction to it.”
Mr Sims is not the first ex-staffer to publish a tell-all about the inner workings of the Trump White House. But he likes to say that he is the first to write one that’s neither “pro-Trump sycophantic” nor “anti-Trump burn the place down”. He reportedly received a seven-figure advance for the book (“Probably won’t comment on that”). The memoir is currently a top-20 non-fiction Amazon bestseller.
Some might take issue with Mr Sims’s questionable justification for writing his revelatory account, especially given that he is particularly unforgiving to his “leaker” White House colleagues. Mr Sims retorts that he is just as hard on himself as on everyone else in the book. In the administration, he embraced his inner-viper, butting heads with the establishment Republican National Committee crowd — a group he and other campaign staffers did not see as particularly loyal to Mr Trump.
For inspiration, Mr Sims says he relied on the White House memoir of Bill Clinton’s former press secretary George Stephanopoulos. However, he notes that the level of palace intrigue in the Clinton White House seemed modest compared to that in the fractious Trump administration.
One area of particular friction was the debates around trade. The president, Mr Sims says, took personal pleasure in pitting the protectionist “nationalists” within the White House against the administration’s free trade “globalists” — and then letting the two sides fight it out.
The problems, Mr Sims says, would arise after Mr Trump had handed his final decision down and the losing side would fight back, either leaking damaging information to the media in an attempt to get the president to change his mind or stalling making the decision. He says: “That’s the part of the palace intrigue I thought was really counterproductive.”
What does he think of the goings-on at the White House now that he’s at a safe distance? The government shutdown, he says, was “a debacle”. And the president still had not managed to get a guarantee for his border wall. “If you ask an eight-year-old on the sidewalk, ‘What’s Donald Trump about?’, they’ll say, ‘The wall’. If the entire premise of your candidacy is, ‘I’m going to fix this stuff and, going into 2020, you can’t tell your voters you got your biggest promise’, that’s going to be a problem.”
The end of the road for Mr Sims came in June 2018, he says, when he was pushed out by rival staffers. In the days afterwards, he struggled to find his way a bit. “There was a sense of relief when it was over. But there was also a sense of fomo [fear of missing out].” For a while thereafter, he says he’d check Twitter or see a segment on TV and think about what he would do in his old job. “Now I pretty much never think about it any more.”
Nor does he miss it. “Overall,” he concludes, “it was kind of a joyless experience.”

196,Is Chile a Brexit seer?,Agreement with the UK aims to protect trade relationship between the two countries,https://www.ft.com/content/54c17880-263f-11e9-8ce6-5db4543da632,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-01T17:26:56Z,"No one knows how the Brexit saga will end. But Chile, which could hardly be further away from the drama playing out in the old continent, is taking no chances.
This week Chile signed an agreement with the UK that aims to protect the existing trade relationship between the two countries should the UK crash out of the EU.
Chile is the first country in the region, if not the first in the world, to do so. It is this kind of forward-thinking that has helped it become the most prosperous economy in Latin America, while so many others, like neighbouring Argentina, are still battling with (very domestic) problems of the past.
Such foresight was on display when Chile became the first country in the world to sign a free trade agreement with China, back in 2005, having realised long ago that if it was to succeed, the small and isolated economy would need to open itself up to the world (it now has more FTAs than any other country on the planet). It is reaping the benefits: Chile’s cherry industry has ballooned thanks to Chinese demand and is beginning to rival its thriving wine sector, after cherry exports doubled last year to $1.1bn.
The diversification of Chile’s economy will play an important role if the country is to escape the notorious “middle-income trap”, but there is still a long way to go.
Although becoming Latin America’s first fully developed economy is something of an obsession of President Sebastián Piñera, he has yet to stamp his mark on his second presidency. Almost a year into his four-year term, and already suffering a steep fall in popularity thanks to social conflicts with the Mapuche indigenous group, the billionaire leader must start to deliver. At the centre of his plans is a tax reform, which he hopes to get through Congress by mid-year, despite lacking a majority. That in turn will pave the way for a more ambitious pension reform.
If Mr Piñera is to succeed in bestowing greater prosperity on Chile, this year will be crucial, especially if he is to avoid the kind of problems that his ally President Mauricio Macri has come up against in Argentina after raising expectations too high.
But the trade deal with the UK this week is an encouraging sign that the importance placed on continuity and stability in Chile, so valued by investors and so key to its success, remains intact.

197,Cuomo says 'we need Amazon' after report the company might cancel its plans to open HQ2 in New York,"New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said in a press conference Friday that state senators' opposition of Amazon's deal to come to the state was ""governmental malpractice.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/08/new-york-governor-cuomo-says-the-state-needs-amazon.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-08T18:48:00Z,"New York Governor Andrew Cuomo lambasted state senators who have opposed his deal to bring Amazon's second ""headquarters"" to Long Island City, saying, ""we have to make Amazon a reality.""
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
""For the state senate to oppose Amazon was governmental malpractice,"" Cuomo said at a press conference on Long Island Friday where he discussed the state budget for the region. ""And if they stop Amazon from coming to New York, they're going to have the people of New York state to explain it to. It is irresponsible to allow political opposition to overcome sound government policy.""
Cuomo's conference came shortly after The Washington Post published a report saying Amazon is reconsidering bringing its new office, along with 25,000 jobs with an average salary of $150,000, to New York's Long Island City neighborhood in Queens. State and local officials have opposed the nearly $3 billion in performance-based incentives the state and city government offered Amazon to lure the company to New York City. City Council officials were not privy to the details of the package until after Amazon had selected New York as one of its two locations for its second headquarters.
Cuomo referenced The Post's reporting as evidence local opposition has begun to scare off Amazon.
""You want to know how dangerous it is?"" Cuomo said, referencing political opposition to Amazon's plans to come to New York. ""There is a story today that says Amazon may not come to New York. If Amazon does not come to New York, it's because of the political opposition.""
The governor said local opposition is standard procedure for change of any kind because ""people just oppose change."" But he argued the state would be giving up an enormous opportunity if it lost this deal with Amazon, saying the volume of high-paying jobs Amazon has promised to bring to the state is practically unheard of.
""I spend days trying to bring a business that has 100 jobs or 200 jobs,"" he said.
Opponents of the state and city's deal with Amazon have taken the reported reconsideration as a sign that their message is resonating with both locals and executives at the company. U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who represents the Bronx and parts of Queens, tweeted The Post's story Friday with the message, ""Can everyday people come together and effectively organize against creeping overreach of one of the world's biggest corporations? Yes, they can.""
Tweet
State Sen. Michael Gianaris, a critic of the Amazon deal who was selected this week to serve on the state board that will ultimately approve or reject Amazon's deal, told CNBC Friday that The Washington Post report was the first he heard of Amazon's reconsideration. But he implied it could be part of a negotiation tactic.
""This is typical of the way Amazon has handled this situation,"" he said. ""If they're trying to extort New York through anonymous threats, they're showing that they're not a responsible corporate actor to begin with. ... If their view is we want your $3 billion or we're leaving, maybe they should leave.""
Cuomo, on the other hand, sees Amazon as a critical piece in his vision for New York's economy.
""You want to diversify your economy? You don't want to just be Wall Street and finance?"" Cuomo asked. ""We need Amazon.""

div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
While Facebook, Amazon and Netflix have rallied by 23 percent or more off that bottom, the Google parent has bounced by less than 20 percent.
Even that rally has pushed it too far, too fast, says Mark Newton, president and technical analyst at Newton Advisors.
""Alphabet has had a very healthy rally since Christmas Eve. It's gotten back about 50 percent of the entire decline we saw since last July. This area is important,"" Newton said on CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Friday. ""It's likely the stock stalls out and starts to pull back a bit.""
The long-term chart also shows the beginnings of a head-and-shoulders formation, says Newton. That pattern forms when a high, higher high, then lower high suggest the end of a bullish trend. Newton says Alphabet would have to fall below $977 to confirm that pattern.
""The bottom line is it had a sharp rally, whereas the broader pattern in the stock over the last year has been really flat. And so I'd rather just hold off and wait to buy under $1,050 as opposed to chasing it here,"" Newton said.
Alphabet, which reports earnings on Monday afternoon, would need to drop 7 percent before reaching Newton's buy level.
John Petrides, portfolio manager at Point View Wealth Management, is more bullish on Alphabet's outlook. He says earnings could give the stock more room to run.
""The stock has had a big run post their Christmas Eve rally here, but I think there could be more to go given their growth rate. Google has had 35 consecutive quarters now where they've had 20 plus percent topline growth. That's amazing,"" Petrides said on ""Trading Nation"" on Friday.
Heading into the earnings report, Petrides said the company is at the ""sweet spot of e-commerce and digital advertising,"" so it should benefit from the same tailwinds that lifted Facebook in the last quarter. He is also watching traffic acquisition costs and how it affects margins and how Alphabet plans to spend its free cash haul.

But if you’re among the many people who have cut the cord in the past year and are wondering how to watch the Super Bowl without cable, there are plenty of viewing options for the game (and, natch, the Super Bowl commercials). Here are a few for fans hoping to watch for free to consider.
How to Watch the Super Bowl on Your TV Without Cable
CBS All Access
This is the moment for CBS’s streaming service to shine. You can sign up for the one week free trial to watch the game, the halftime show, as well as any special coverage from the network in the hours leading up to and after the game. You’ll also be able to access original online programs, including Star Trek: Discovery. A subscription to the service, should you stay, costs $6 per month.
PlayStation Vue
NBC’s not available on this streaming service that was only available on the PlayStation game console, but CBS is. PlayStation Vue, of course, can now be viewed on most mobile and streaming devices (like Amazon Fire TV or as a downloadable app to Smart TVs). The free trial is a bit longer, too, coming in at 14 days, which will give you plenty of time to watch the Super Bowl and everything that comes after it.
Should you decide to subscribe, packages start at $45 per month. Diehard football fans, though, will want to opt for either the $50 “Core” or $60 “Elite” plan, because they both include the NFL Network, at least five ESPN channels, and several Fox Sports options.
Fubo TV
This cord-cutting service, which caters to sports fans, carries CBS in most markets, meaning you should be in good shape to watch Super Bowl LIII. After the seven-day trial, prices jump to $40 or $45 per month for the first month (then add another $5 per month afterward). Note that the service does not carry ESPN, which will cut back on some of your commentary and post-game interview options.
NFL Game Pass
The official streaming app of the NFL will, of course, feature the Patriots vs. Rams when they play at 6:30 p.m. ET. But if you’d rather skip the pre-game hype from color commentators, you can rewatch past games from either team (or any NFL team) in either the full broadcast or a condensed 45-minute version. The service costs $50 per month, but there’s a free trial that will get you through the Super Bowl.
Over the Air
Don’t want to do a trial with a streaming service, because you’re already happy with the one you have or don’t want to forget and be billed later? A good antenna is an easy option. The Mohu Leaf, for example, has an unobtrusive design that’s not much bigger (or thicker) than a sheet of paper and is extremely effective at picking up local high def channels.
How to Watch the Super Bowl on Your Mobile Device
Sling TV
Dish Network’s Sling is one of the oldest cord cutter options. It includes the major networks, including CBS. As a bonus, you’ll also have access to ESPN, NFL Network, and Fox Sports, depending on the package you choose. You’ve got a seven-day free preview before the monthly fees, which range $25 to $40, kick in.
DirecTV Now
AT&amp;T’s cable competitor will let you stream seven days for free and offers basic service that includes CBS and most major cable networks, offering both the game and plenty of post-game analysis, in case the referees blow as many calls as they did in the playoffs. Subscription costs, after the trial, start at $40 per month.
Hulu with Live TV
Hulu’s known for its deep back catalog of programs (and more recently for its originals), but the addition of live programming a couple years ago makes it a viable choice for cord cutters. You can try the service free for a week for access to the major networks (including CBS), ESPN, ESPN2, three other ESPN channels, and two Fox Sports channels. Once that’s up, you’ll pay $40 per month.
How to Watch the Super Bowl Online
YouTube TV
Google offers more than 60 channels and offers six log-in accounts per subscription, meaning you can watch Tom Brady and Jared Goff marshal their teams while your kid catches up on Teen Titans Go!. And it just wrapped up its national expansion with the 2019 Super Bowl in mind. The 30-day free trial of the service is now just a memory, but you can still get a free week. After that, you’ll face a $40 per month charge.
CBSSports app and Website
Because the game is such an important financial and ratings driver for CBS, the network will stream it for free online via its CBSSports website and app. You can easily download that to your Roku, Amazon Fire TV Stick, Apple TV, or Google Chromecast device."

""I will be writing the corporate management of Walgreens and requesting a meeting with them to discuss whether there is a corporate-wide issue related to their stores' non-compliance and put them on notice that the FDA is considering additional enforcement avenues to address their record of violative tobacco sales to youth,"" Gottlieb said in a statement.
Walgreens is currently the top violator among pharmacies that sell tobacco products, the FDA said, with 22 percent of the stores the FDA has inspected being found illegally selling tobacco products to minors.
The FDA is banning one Walgreens store in Miami, Florida and a Circle K store in Charleston, South Carolina, from selling tobacco products for 30 days because they have been caught illegally selling tobacco products to minors at least five times.
Gottlieb said he's ""deeply disturbed that a single pharmacy chain racked up almost 1,800 violations for selling tobacco products to minors across the country.""
""I have particular concerns about whether the pharmacy setting is influencing consumer and retailer perceptions around tobacco products in a way that's contributing to these troubling findings,"" he said.
Walgreens did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment."

""It's Under Armour's bad luck that they compete against one of the best-run businesses on earth,"" he said.
Molson Coors: The ""Mad Money"" host also didn't expect much from Molson Coors' quarterly results, though he did note that the beer brewer's report could affect pot stocks.
""I think the cannabis stocks could be in play because this company understands it may need to take a bigger plunge into the marijuana market than the tire-kicking it's done so far,"" he argued. ""See, the Canadian cannabis stocks started to roll over this week after an incredible run, but the fact is they are really serving as beer replacement[s] in a lot of states.""
Occidental Petroleum: Even though he called Occidental ""one of the healthier ... oil companies"" out there, with ""fabulous"" properties in Texas' oil-rich Permian Basin, Cramer preferred a different energy play.
""I like BP more if you want to own an oil because it has a higher, 5.8 percent yield,"" he said. ""That's a full percentage point above [Occidental]. Believe me, with oil looking like it is going back to the $40s, you're going to need some yield protection.""
Twilio: The action in shares of Twilio, a cloud-based communication enabler that works with the likes of Airbnb and Lyft, concerned Cramer ahead of the company's Tuesday earnings report.
""[Twilio] represents, I think, maybe the best growth stock in tech right now,"" he said, adding that he'd like to buy shares for his charitable trust. ""But [...] the stock is running right up into what we call 'the print' it gained more than 4 [basis] points today alone.""
""I want this stock to be lower to buy, but I bet the quarter's a legit blowout like the last one,"" he added.
Activision Blizzard: Could this video game maker be capitalizing on the battle royale trend set by Fortnite like some of its peers? Cramer's eager to find out when Activision issues its quarterly results Tuesday evening.
""Activision's stock has lost nearly half of its value since October, but I think EA put a floor under the group today, which means this one might be worth speculating on,"" he said."
202,Amazon stock falls after CFO says regulation in India and increased spending on the horizon,"Amazon stock was down Friday morning following its fourth quarter 2018 earnings report where the company provided light guidance, telling investors it would likely spend more in 2019.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/01/amazon-falls-on-fears-of-regulation-in-india-and-increased-spending.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-01T15:07:00Z,"Amazon fell 4 percent Friday morning after the company announced on a call with investors it would likely increase investment in 2019 and raised concerns about new regulation in India.
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
Amazon's stock initially popped after hours on its fourth quarter 2018 earnings report Thursday. The stock took a steep turn during the company's call with analysts when Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said Amazon plans to increase investments this year after scaling back capital expenditures and hiring the year prior.
The company's market value hovered around $800 billion Friday morning, and briefly fell below $800 billion in early trading. At one point last year, the stock hit $1 trillion in market value during intraday trading.
In notes following the report, analysts expressed concern about increased expenditures and a new law in India that will soon come into effect preventing foreign online retailers from selling products through affiliated companies. Amazon's roadblocks in India have contributed to slowing international sales growth and may have influenced the company's light guidance for the first quarter of 2019. Amazon expects revenue for Q1 between $56 billion and $60 billion, slightly below the $60.8 billion consensus estimated by FactSet.
""There is much uncertainty as to what the impact of the government rule change is going to have on the e-commerce sector there,"" Olsavsky said on the call. ""Our main issue and our main concern is trying to minimize the impact to our customers and sellers in India.""
Analysts largely seemed confident in the stock despite slightly lowering their price targets.
J.P. Morgan's Doug Anmuth lowered his price target, writing, ""Uncertainty in India, along w/a higher 4Q base, takes early 2019 revenue acceleration off the table... But we still expect AMZN to grow revenue 18% FXN for the year and operating income by 30%. And we want AMZN to invest into long-term growth opportunities...""
Deutsche Bank's Lloyd Walmsley, on the other hand, raised his price target and said, ""We think Amazon is ultimately going to substantially expand its physical footprint and push further into healthcare and shipping/logistics, opening up its addressable markets further. Notwithstanding the volatility in the shares, we think valuations remain compelling..""

div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
""If you're selling Amazon off this you're really stupid,"" Cramer said on ""Squawk on the Street.""
The owner of the Enquirer David Pecker's American Media Inc. released a statement Friday morning denying the Bezos claims. It read in part, ""American Media believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos,"" adding however that its board ""should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims.""
In a Thursday blog post headlined, ""No thank you, Mr. Pecker,"" Bezos claims that AMI asked him to publicly deny any political motivation in the Enquirer's coverage of his divorce, in exchange for not publishing photos he texted Sanchez, including a ""below the belt selfie.""
Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, announced their divorce on Jan. 9. Later that day, the Enquirer broke news about Bezos' affair with Sanchez.
While shrugging off the alleged Enquirer extortion, Cramer did say it's reasonable for investors to be concerned about how Bezos' divorce might impact Amazon stock, as any separation agreement would make MacKenzie a major shareholder of the e-commerce giant.
""Isn't the issue the dumping of the stock by his soon-to-be ex-wife? The stock is down huge on that,"" said the ""Mad Money"" host, whose charitable trust owns Amazon shares. ""People are worried she'll blow out of the stock.""
However, Cramer countered that argument, saying ""focus on the fundamentals"" at Amazon.
Bezos, best known for founding Amazon, is still the company's largest shareholder by far, owning 16.3 percent of its shares, according to the company's 2018 proxy statement. Washington state, where Amazon is headquartered and the Bezoses own a home, is a ""community property"" state, meaning if the couple files for divorce there, all assets and debts accrued during their marriage will be considered owned by both husband and wife.

All references must be sourced to CNBC.
ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: In the meantime, we want to get to the other side of the coast, Pebble Beach. Joe and Becky are standing by with another big guest. Joe.
JOE KERNEN: Thank you, Andrew.
ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: Becky.
JOE KERNEN: That is true. Yep, Becky. Go ahead.
BECKY QUICK: We're both here. Joining us right now is the host of the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, AT&amp;T Chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson. Randall, thanks for being here.
RANDALL STEPHENSON: Thanks for having me.
BECKY QUICK: You know, I was walking the course yesterday, seeing the AT&amp;T signage everywhere, watching it get picked up on CBS, all the places where it's getting played. And I just started thinking about The Super Bowl and how it's now $5 million for 30 seconds in the Super Bowl. I don't know how much this costs, but is this a -- is this more or less than that? How do you kind of look at this and think: Okay, this is what we're spending and this is why?
RANDALL STEPHENSON: Well, I -- we've never disclosed what we pay to sponsor this. I hope Jay Monahan is in bed, because he's the guy we negotiate these deals with. But I would tell you, this is the best ROI of any advertising promotion that we do. And you know, we're interacting with some of the biggest customers in the B2B world -- in the world. And it's a great event. It gets great carriage for both the consumer as well as businesses. It just crosses the boundaries on multiple demographics. So we just love this event for that reason.
JOE KERNEN: So just in terms of the pure golf fan, you know, you know, there's only four majors, but I'd have trouble, you know, the next four this would probably be one of my and plus there was a major being played here later this year. So the venue here is so amazing. Then you throw in Spy Glass and Monterrey. I think it's the best non-major event of the year, don't you think? I really think
RANDALL STEPHENSON: I obviously agree with that. This is a -- it's really a freakishly unique event because you're playing with the best athletes in the world. And amateurs are inside the ropes 
JOE KERNEN: That's the freakish part. You're looking at me. We're out there in the same ropes as 
RANDALL STEPHENSON: Well, they're playing with live ammo. You're in there inside the ropes playing the same game they're playing and your shots matter. It's just -- it's really strange. Think of what other sport exists where amateurs get into the live play with the real athletes and get to see them up close and in person?
JOE KERNEN: And everybody shows up for this too, as far as the pros.
RANDALL STEPHENSON: Yeah, it's a great event. It really is.
BECKY QUICK: Randall, I want to talk to you about the disappointment the Street had with earnings last week. Stock was down and I think it was the surprise in decline of subscribers, both at DirecTV and DirecTV Now. There are people questioning on the Street whether you can turn the TV business around there. What do you say to them?
RANDALL STEPHENSON: I the results were really right in line with what we told the Street back in November. And we had said we expect to see continued declined in the traditional video business and what we are doing is now investing in a new streaming service. It's over in Warner Media. And you know, now that you own a large scale media company, the idea that you can now build an SVOD: a subscription video on demand service that is premium, that is unique, it's leveraged off the HBO content, the Warner Brothers' content, that is where the investment is going for streaming television, a SVOD service. The traditional linear, we expect it to continue to decline. We expected that when we bought DirecTV. We've generated a lot of synergies with that acquisition. It was a typical synergy deal. You buy a declining business, you extract a lot of cost synergies. And people forget, within 18 months we had generated about a $3.5 billion run rate synergy in this business. Still generating $4 billion of cash flow. That $4 billion is now being invested in the new platforms. So it's being invested in fiber deployment and the fiber deployment is going great. In fact, our Broadband business in the quarter was up 6%, 7%. We're investing in an advertising business. And by the way, since we bought DirecTV, we have stood this advertising business up. It's a very unique business. It's a $2 billion a year business now and it grew 26% last quarter. So we're investing in that and investing in the SVOD. So what you're seeing is investment in the traditional linear goes down, you'll see subscribers continue to go down. As we stand up the SVOD service, you're going to see significant growth over here. That's where our excitement is, that's where we're putting our focus and our investment.
JOE KERNEN: Would anything else be possible if you didn't do DirecTV, do you think? It gave you a footprint, didn't it, to do this?
RANDALL STEPHENSON: It would have been really hard to execute this strategy had you not done DirecTV. Because you needed some basis to get content delivered to mobile. The world of mobile. That's what we're always trying to accomplish. And we have been trying to do that for many, many years. We actually got that done. We got all of the rights to begin distributing to mobile within months of closing DirecTV. And so now you do a media company, you own a media company, and you also have a great IP and you stand up a new SVOD service, Video on Demand service. Now you have just built in distribution for this SVOD. Not traditional DirecTV subscribers, but through your mobile subscribers. And so the two work hand in hand. And the next two or three years, bringing these two together, standing these up and distributing.
JOE KERNEN: I mean is there a shareholder class that just is wants more near-term results? The -- it wasn't identical to what Comcast experienced with Sky, but initially looks like a great asset. Comcast killed to get it and yet the stock, some people decide: Look, the debt is going up too much, it is going to be -- the payoff is going to be down the road. But if you're building something for the future, do you see it the same way, who are the shareholders that decide: I'm not going to be here so if the stock goes down but long-term you say two or three years?
RANDALL STEPHENSON: They're very similar plays that we're running. You know, we have put a significant amount of debt on to do the Time Warner--
JOE KERNEN: That's what has people--
RANDALL STEPHENSON: That's what concerns people. And I recognize that. And I have said number one focus for 2019 is to address the debt situation. So think about what has happened here. We put on $40 billion of debt to do time warner. That was done in June. By the time we got to end of the year, we had paid down $9 billion of the $40 billion. By the time we get to the end of the year this year, we'll have paid down 75% of that debt. So the ability to service this debt is very, very achievable. We've told the Street straight up, you should expect us, after some of the highest capital spending in the U.S. to generate $26 billion of free cash flow this year -- we just did 7.9 in the last quarter, 7.9 billion in one quarter. $26 billion, we'll pay a 14 billion dollar dividend. There is $12 billion of cash that will go to debt pay down. We have asset sales that are stacked up of 6 to 8 billion. There's about, you know, 30 some odd billion dollars. So you'll get to 75% of the debt paid off as we exit this year and imminent line to sight doing the rest in 2020.
BECKY QUICK: You did mention though $14 billion a year in dividends. I think the yield is something like 6.9%. And that has some people starting to wonder, I think the majority of analysts still believe that the dividend is completely safe. Is there any chance that you would either reduce or freeze the dividend for any point of time to pay down that debt faster?
RANDALL STEPHENSON: The reality is that we don't have to talk about that. When you generate $26 billion of free cash flow and a $14 billion dividend, that's not even in the equation. You have $12 billion after paying the dividend. And that is while you're investing at the highest levels of anybody in the United States of America. So the cash flow characteristics of this business are really unique. I mean they really, really are. Think about coming out of the first full quarter where we own Time Warner, and we have record cash flow, record operating cash flow, record free cash flow, free cash flow is up 70-some odd percent for the quarter. And the so the cash flow characteristics are performing exactly like what we anticipated. And so you know, as we exit 2019, I think people will be comfortable with our ability to manage their debt. You know, people talk about $170 billion debt. Well it's a $60 billion EBITDA company, okay? So the debt is imminently manageable. And so people get more secure with the dividend, and I'm confident as we go through 2019.
JOE KERNEN: Do you hear things about the time frame for finding out, you know, the latest challenge from the government on the deal? It was supposed to be the end of this month, wasn't it?
RANDALL STEPHENSON: Yeah, I think 
JOE KERNEN: Do you know?
RANDALL STEPHENSON: Our lawyers' expectation is it should be this month. We should hear something.
JOE KERNEN: Any -- any body language about -- is there anything new because the last -- that judge was so definitive last time.
RANDALL STEPHENSON: There were oral arguments 
JOE KERNEN: Yeah. How'd those go?
RANDALL STEPHENSON: -- in front of the circuit court in December. And we left those those arguments feeling very good about how the discussion went. But, you know, it is the courts, so you don't know until you get the ruling from the judges. But we're feeling comfortable right now.
BECKY QUICK: Andrew has a question, as you can probably hear him saying.
RANDALL STEPHENSON: Yep. Good ahead Andrew.
ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: Randall, good to see you. I don't know if you saw this headline--
RANDALL STEPHENSON: Hi Andrew.
ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: --But I did want to ask you about it because it is making news. Sprint filed a federal lawsuit yesterday against AT&amp;T over your use of 5GE in your marketing. This is this sort of next generation 5G, I guess what you are calling the 5G evolution in place of LTE. They're saying that that is effectively marketing fraud, that AT&amp;T doesn't have a 5G service available to the public yet. What do you -- how do you respond to that?
RANDALL STEPHENSON: Well, it will play itself out, obviously. But we feel very comfortable with how we have characterized the new service that we're launching. What we do, Andrew, is we go into a market, and we turn up a significant block of Spectrum wireless air ways that we own. I mean, it is rather dramatic. And we're deploying new technology, but I won't go into the details of it. But when we go in a market, and we turn up this technology, and we light up this Spectrum, our customers are seeing radical increases in speed and performance on the network. And this is a step. This is a step that is required to get to ultimate 5G. And it's an evolutionary step to 5G. It's a critical step. So we are characterizing this as 5GE, 5G Evolution. We obviously have done our homework. We've done a lot of work around how we characterize this. And we're being very clear with our customers that this is an evolutionary step. This is a dramatic step change improvement in what the customers' experience where we turn this up. And I fully understand why our competitors might be upset with this. It is not a play everybody can run. It's a play that we really like and it's a play that will differentiate us in the marketplace as begin we roll this out over the course of this year.
JOE KERNEN: Are you -- are you going to the Oscars this year?
RANDALL STEPHENSON: You probably won't see me at the Oscars this year.
JOE KERNEN: Is Stankey going? I mean, who is the mogul? Who
RANDALL STEPHENSON: Stankey. Stankey better be there.
JOE KERNEN: He's got to be there. You will see him there. He's like 
RANDALL STEPHENSON: Absolutely.
JOE KERNEN: He's like 8 feet tall 
RANDALL STEPHENSON: So you will see him
JOE KERNEN: He's your mogul representative?
RANDALL STEPHENSON: He's our mogul. He just screams mogul, doesn't he?
JOE KERNEN: I always saw you moving out there and just hobnobbing with all of them. No, I didn't see that, actually. But anyway. Thanks very much.
RANDALL STEPHENSON: Good seeing you guys. Thank you for being here.
BECKY QUICK: Thank you. Randall Stephenson. Andrew, we'll back to you.

205,Amazon taking over the NFL Sunday Ticket is the dream scenario for football fans,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos was in attendance at Sunday's Super Bowl, and there's one argument I hope he was making to Roger Goodell.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/04/amazon-should-take-over-sunday-ticket-unbundle-it.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-04T18:13:00Z,"Nobody wants to talk about football today after the pathetic excuse for a Super Bowl on Sunday, the lowest-scoring NFL championship game ever. While New England fans never tire of watching Commissioner Roger Goodell hand the Lombardi Trophy to Patriots owner Robert Kraft or of seeing Tom Brady win yet another ring, the rest of America tuned out this year. It was the lowest-rated Super Bowl in a decade.
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
The most interesting thing to happen during the game wasn't on the field. It happened when CBS panned to the commissioner's booth to reveal Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos schmoozing with Goodell and some other bigwigs.
Seattle Seahawks fans speculated that Bezos might be in attendance to bend Goodell's ear about buying the team from Jodi Allen, the sister of late owner and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who died last year. But there's a more exciting possibility.
What if the world's wealthiest person was in Atlanta to lay the groundwork for Amazon takining over the NFL's Sunday Ticket deal from AT&amp;T's DirecTV? That could be a dream come true for NFL fans everywhere, especially those (like me) who live in TV markets outside of where their favorite team plays.
For those of you who aren't NFL football fans, an explanation is in order. Each Sunday during the regular season, between three and 10 games air during the two main slots at 1 p.m. and around 4 p.m. Eastern time. All of those games are televised. But NFL rules require local stations to broadcast the game being played by any team in that TV market. No other games can supersede that game. So if you live in San Francisco, like me, you'll be forced to watch the execrable Oakland Raiders (as long as they're still here) and San Francisco 49ers (who now play in Santa Clara), even though I'm a die-hard Seahawks fan.
The way around this, until now, has been through the NFL Sunday Ticket, which is only available to DirecTV subscribers. I'd have to cancel my cable, sign up for DirecTV, and then pay an additional $300 (or more) for four months of Sunday Ticket, which gives me the right to watch every game.
But even if I wanted to swap cable for DirecTV, I don't want to watch every game. I want to watch Seahawks games, and maybe the occasional conference game that affects Seattle's playoff chances.
The other option is to go a bar Danny Coyle's on Haight Street is the Seahawks bar in San Francisco but that means I don't get to watch with my 8-year-old son. There are also illegal streams available via Reddit, but they're unreliable, plagued by interruptions and pop-up windows. Or so I hear.
DirecTV's deal with the NFL expires in 2022.
What I'd like to see is for Amazon to take over, then negotiate with the NFL to blast apart the all-or-nothing bundle for out-of-market games, and instead sell them a la carte. I'd pay $20 every week the Seahawks aren't televised locally just to watch from the couch with my son. I'm sure many other casual football fans are in the same situation. The hardcore fans who need to watch every game to keep track of their fantasy players will still pay top dollar, but the NFL is passing up extra cash from people like me.
I can only hope Bezos was making the same argument to Goodell on Sunday.

Bezos, Amazon's single largest shareholder and the world's richest man, revealed in a personal online post Thursday night that the Enquirer allegedly tried to blackmail him, showing emails threatening to publish nude selfies and details of his extramarital affair. 
""At the end of the day, we get back to the fundamentals of the company, irrespective of what executives are doing,"" said Ron Josey, internet analyst at JMP Securities. ""I would be surprised if it had a negative impact on Amazon. It's such a large business with a lot of different opportunities and operation. The way it's set up with leadership across retail and AWS and the businesses underneath with logistics and advertising there's a lot of support here.""
""I don't think the allegations have a direct line into the fundamentals of Amazon,"" added Anthony DiClemente, internet analyst at Evercore ISI. ""Certainly from a public relations standpoint, I don't think it's ideal. When you look at the fundamentals, it's hard to imagine it will have a negative impact.""
The personal woes for Bezos began when he announced the plans to divorce his wife of 25 years on Jan.9, leaving the whole industry speculating how it could impact Amazon shareholders and Bezos own 16 percent stake. Later the online retailer on Jan. 31 reported mixed fourth-quarter earnings and issued weak guidance."

However, Smith refused to comment on a weekend Bloomberg report about Starboard taking a stake in the embattled pharmaceutical giant, which last month agreed to buy troubled cancer drug company Celgene in a cash and stock deal valued at $74 billion.
Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb closed up nearly 2 percent Monday after seesawing on the uncertainty surrounding whether Starboard took a position or not. The stock was lower Tuesday.
Deflecting repeated questions by CNBC's David Faber, Smith said in a ""Squawk on the Street"" interview from the New York Stock Exchange, ""I am not going to discuss Bristol-Myers."" But he did say, ""We are certainly interested in the story at Bristol-Myers.""
A request for comment from Bristol-Myers was not immediately returned.
Broadly speaking, Smith described what he considers Starboard's mission of representing the best interests of shareholders, and how disgruntled shareholders often bring insight to the hedge fund about certain situations.
""We evaluate those situations to determine whether we can have a positive impact,"" he explained. ""Bristol-Myers might fit that profile,"" he said. ""It might not fit that profile. We haven't made that decision.""
""If we make that decision I'll tell you what, I will come on and talk to you about it,"" Smith added, jokingly referring to the main topic of the interview, which was Starboard's new $200 million investment in struggling pizza chain Papa John's.

The Canaccord Genuity chief market strategist is predicting the S&amp;P 500 will end the year at 2,950, about 9 percent higher than Thursday's close.
However, he expects stocks to drop around 3 percent first and that will be the buying opportunity.
""If you don't expect that the market can correct, you get scared when it does,"" Dwyer said Thursday on CNBC's ""Fast Money.""
His primary reason for the 2019 rally: Federal Reserve monetary policy. The central bank has been gradually raising interest rates and drawing down its balance sheet. However, in January it opted not to raise rates and indicated it would take a ""patient"" approach going forward.
Dwyer thinks the Fed may actually reverse course, and that will push stocks higher.
""You've got to have a Fed rate cut sometime this year. You are getting weak data in Germany. You are getting weak data in China,"" he said.
Former Fed Chair Janet Yellen told CNBC on Wednesday that the central bank's next move could be an interest rate cut if weakening global growth spills into the United States.
U.S. stocks are up sharply for the year, thanks to the best January performance in three decades. On Thursday, equities fell on news that it was ""highly unlikely"" that President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet before the March trade-deal deadline.

When a stock buyback occurs, a company chooses to use its excess cash to repurchase a predeteremined amount of its own stock. Repurchased shares are absorbed by the company, and the number of outstanding shares on the market is reduced. That has the effect of enriching those who'd then own a relatively larger slice of a company by making each share more valuable.
Even armed with statistics from Goldman Sachs it's not difficult to see how this could widen the income gap between the nation's richest and poorest households.
Source: Congressional Budget Office
""It is indeed true that stock ownership has become more concentrated,"" Goldman chief economist Jan Hatzius wrote last month. The wealthiest 0.1 percent and 1 percent of households now own about 17 percent and 50 percent of total household equities respectively, up significantly from 13 percent and 39 percent in the late 1980s.
""Over the past several decades, corporate boardrooms have become obsessed with maximizing only shareholder earnings to the detriment of workers and the long-term strength of their companies, helping to create the worst level of income inequality in decades,"" the senators wrote.
According to the most recent Census data, the bottom 20 percent of households earned 3.5 percent of the nation's income while the richest 5 percent kept 21.8 percent of the pie, down from 22.8 percent in 2016. Households in the lowest quintile had incomes of $24,638 or less in 2017, while the top 5 percent of households in the income distribution had incomes of $237,035 or more.

Others, such as Stanford Law Professor Laurie Hodrick, challenge that opinion and argue that the more socially prosperous thing to do is to return residual monies to investors in the form of buybacks and dividends. Such a move would ensure the healthiest companies have access to the capital they need to grow their business and maximize employment, she said.
""The irony is that the thing to boost economic well-being in the long term would be to channel the capital to where it will contribute most to long-term prosperity,"" Hodrick said Tuesday. ""If you really want a long-term, robust economy that will hire and pay workers, the best way to do that is reallocate cash to investors.""
Corporations have been on a hiring binge lately with robust nonfarm payroll gains in the past 12 months. The unemployment rate ticked higher to 4 percent in January and more Americans re-enter the workforce. On a year-over-year basis average hourly earnings rose 3.2 percent, consistent with the past few months and around the highest levels of the recovery."
210,Analysis | Where Tech Giants Are Getting Slapped Over Privacy - Washington Post,Strict new privacy rules that took effect in the European Union last May give regulators unprecedented powers to protect people from having their data misused by companies doing business there. Everyone from hotels and restaurants to Amazon.com Inc. and Faceb…,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-08/where-tech-giants-are-getting-slapped-over-privacy-quicktake,"{'id': 'bloomberg', 'name': 'Bloomberg'}",2019-02-08T01:35:43Z,"Strict new privacy rules that took effect in the European Union last May give regulators unprecedented powers to protect people from having their data misused by companies doing business there. Everyone from hotels and restaurants to Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc. scrambled for months to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation, which mandates fines of as much as 4 percent of global annual sales for infractions. Alphabet Inc.s Google got a bitter taste in January of whats at stake when the French data protection authority fined it a record 50 million euros ($56.8 million) for privacy violations -- the highest such penalty ever in the EU.
1. What did Google do wrong?
The Commission Nationale de lInformatique et des Libertes, the French regulator known as CNIL, said Google failed to inform users properly about the data it collects on them and how its used to personalize advertisements. The probe followed complaints from two digital-rights advocacy groups, None of Your Business (noyb), created by Austrian activist Max Schrems, and La Quadrature du Net of France. The groups acted together on behalf of at least 10,000 people and accused Google of not having a valid legal basis to process the personal data of the users of its services, according to CNIL. The regulator concluded Googles deficiencies could result in users revealing important parts of their private life. Google has appealed the decision.
2. What other penalties might be coming?
On Jan. 18, Noyb filed a new series of privacy complaints across Europe, this time targeting companies including Googles YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix Inc. Facebook faces multiple probes by the Irish data commissioner under GDPR, including one into a security breach that affected as many as 50 million accounts. The EUs executive arm said on Jan. 25 that national data protection authorities across the 28-nation bloc have by now received more than 95,000 complaints from citizens. GDPR gives equal powers, for the first time, to national watchdogs to fine companies for the most serious violations. On Feb. 7, Germanys Federal Cartel Office ordered Facebook to overhaul how it tracks users internet browsing, citing violations of the GDPR among its reasons.
3. Will the U.S. ever have its own version of GDPR?
In 2018, California approved a privacy law that drew comparisons to GDPR. The regulations, which go into effect in 2020, give consumers the right to know what data has been collected on them, the choice to opt out of the sale of their personal information and the ability to have some data on them deleted. Given the rules there and in Europe, tech firms are seeking a uniform federal law that would overrule state statutes like Californias, but consumer advocates say a U.S. law could weaken strong state protections. A push by industry could help a privacy law through a divided Congress, but political gridlock poses major challenges. In the meantime, some companies like Facebook are preemptively extending certain GDPR-like protections to customers in the U.S.
4. How does GDPR work?
Companies have to post clear notices for users and get their unambiguous consent to collect data, instead of burying an O.K. inside fine print and legal jargon. Confusing terms and conditions that must be agreed to when signing up for a fitness tracking app or ordering groceries online are no longer tolerated. (Whether you actually read and absorb all the emails and pop-ups asking for consent is up to you.) The new rules also oblige companies to make it easier for people to retrieve their data, to give (or sell) it to another business, and to disallow its use for direct marketing purposes. Collection of data on children under the age of 16 without parental approval is banned. In response to the GDPR, WhatsApp raised the minimum age for its users to 16.
5. Who must follow these rules?
GDPR covers any entity in the EU that is processing personal data by collecting it, storing it or disseminating it. This means its not just social-networking sites, search engines and big online retailers: The rules also apply to information collected by schools, chat rooms, property management companies and even scout groups. In worst-case scenarios, those in charge can risk prison sentences.
6. What constitutes personal data?
As defined by the EU, any data thats sensitive in nature and can be linked to a person falls under the umbrella of protection. This includes credit card numbers, travel records, religious affiliations, web search results, biometric data from wearable fitness monitors, and internet (IP) and personal computer addresses. It doesnt include legal actions or public records, and the media benefit from some exemptions to reconcile privacy with freedom of expression.
7. What is compliance going to cost firms?
A study last year by Ernst &amp; Young found that the worlds 500 largest companies were on track to spend a collective $7.8 billion to comply with GDPR. By the start of 2019, most of the kinks had been worked out and even laggards had brought their sites up to snuff. But costs for many companies have ended up being higher than anticipated: In an Irish report released in November, more than 60 percent of companies said compliance costs had outstripped their expectations.
8. What is required to comply?
Organizations with more than 250 employees need to have a data protection officer, who makes sure the rules are followed through employee training and compliance audits. If a firm is smaller than 250 people but collects large quantities of sensitive data, it also needs a DPO. If theres a data breach, authorities must be notified within 72 hours and customers informed in a timely manner if the breach poses a risk to them. Situations like Uber Technologies Inc.s attempts to cover up its 2016 data hack, or the slow release of information on Yahoos massive data breach in 2013, are now punishable with huge fines.
9. How does GDPR change life for consumers?
Consumers have been barraged with alerts asking them to review their privacy settings and permit websites to use their data. Users visiting a site for the first time can be blocked from browsing further unless they click a box and consent to having their data collected. EU consumers can request access to the data thats been collected on them and how its being used. Data will be destroyed when it is no longer needed for the original task. And because consumers now own their data, they may eventually be able to trade for goodies like gift certificates from Zara in exchange for their shopping history with J. Crew.
10. What data can consumers get removed?
Through the right to be forgotten -- a protection created by the EUs top court in 2014 and enshrined in GDPR -- citizens can force organizations to erase information that was illegally gained or no longer holds true. Data that serves no current purpose or has been used for direct marketing could also be on the chopping block. In some cases, consumers who dont give permission for websites to use their information may not be allowed to post on social media or consumer review sites.

211,These Are The Most Popular Corporate Apps,"Microsoft, Salesforce, and the AWS have the most popular corporate apps, according to Okta research.",http://fortune.com/2019/02/07/microsoft-salesforce-aws-okta-corporate-apps/,"{'id': 'fortune', 'name': 'Fortune'}",2019-02-07T23:15:51Z,"Microsoft, Salesforce, and Amazon Web Services have the most popular corporate apps, according to new research released on Thursday.
The leader is Microsoft’s Office 365 workplace software that includes apps like Word and Excel, according to the annual study from security firm Okta. But the rankings show that many corporate workers also use Office 365 competitors, meaning that they pick and chose elements of Microsoft’s software that they like while relying on other companies for the rest.
Seventy-six percent of Okta’s customers who use Office 365 also use similar workplace software from rival companies, the survey found. Of those who use Microsoft Office 365, about 32% use Box’s app to store digital files (Microsoft’s version is OneDrive) and 28% use the Slack app to chat with co-workers (Microsoft’s competitor is Teams).
Okta’s research is based on nearly 5,000 of its customers plus a survey of 1,200 U.S. workers from other companies. Okta, which went public in 2017, specializes in technology that verifies employee identities across multiple apps and services.
Additionally, Okta’s study showed that 28% of Okta customers who use Office 365 also use Google’s G Suite collection of workplace apps that includes Gmail and Drive. This is noteworthy because companies appear to be double bundling, the report’s authors said, referring to firms using two different collections of workplace apps simultaneously.
Okta CEO Todd McKinnon said the report shows that “the diversity of applications are growing” inside companies, meaning they are not sticking to one vendor to supply them with all their workplace software.
It’s part of a trend in enterprise software that has led to companies specializing in workplace apps working to ensure that their software products work well with third parties. Last summer, for instance, Slack partnered with other software companies like Zendesk and Atlassian.
Get Data Sheet, Fortunes technology newsletter.
Of course, Okta’s business is also partially dependent on the trend that companies will use multiple enterprise apps, considering its software helps link them together.
“If one company made all the technology we would be in trouble,” McKinnon said.

div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
In November after a nearly year-long search, Amazon selected the Long Island City neighborhood of New York and the National Landing neighborhood of Arlington, Va., as the two sites of its East Coast headquarters. The announcement was met almost immediately with protest by some New York City officials and residents who feared Amazon would take over the neighborhood, drive up prices and and push out existing residents and families. 
Each of the new headquarters is intended to house 25,000 Amazon employees. 
Amazon has yet to build or lease any space in Long Island City, and isn't expected to receive full approval from local governments until 2020, The Post reported citing unnamed sources. That makes walking back a deal relatively easy.
It's unclear what a Plan B for the headquarters would look like, after the spectacle that the first contest became. State and local governments offered tax incentives and other gifts in an attempt to sway the choice. 
In addition to the planned developments in New York and Virginia, Amazon is also preparing a third investment in Nashville, Tennessee. It will become home to Amazon's East Coast operations hub and create 5,000 jobs. 
In comparison to New York, Virginia and Tennessee have been largely welcoming of Amazon's plans.

He explained that the situation is expected to stabilize later in the year once the government issues more clarity on the changes.
As Amazon attempts to comply with the new rules, more than 400,000 items available on its Indian site could temporarily disappear, the New York Times reported last week. That would account for nearly a third of Amazon's estimated $6 billion in annual sales in India, the paper said.

214,The rise of Sajid Javid,He defied the odds to become home secretary and is a contender for the Tory leadership. Could he reach the top?,https://www.ft.com/content/38a4a80c-29a0-11e9-a5ab-ff8ef2b976c7,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-08T05:01:20Z,"The bodyguard opens the door of the armoured black limousine and out steps Sajid Javid; sleek, immaculately tailored, assured. Britain’s home secretary strides across the manicured lawns at a science campus outside London; doors swing open in front of him, his entourage in his wake.
Javid holds Britain’s archetypal establishment job; he oversees the country’s secrets and its borders. When Theresa May’s stricken premiership finally ends, the 49-year-old is viewed as one of the favourites to succeed her.
He is a multimillionaire who took a steep pay cut from his job at Deutsche Bank to go into politics, yet the man hoping to walk through the door of Number 10 has a surprising confession to make. “It would probably sound strange sitting here as home secretary that you sometimes feel a little bit like an outsider, but I guess it is a bit like that still.”
Javid, who barely needs to open a door himself these days, spent most of his young life having them slammed in his face. Behind the smooth exterior is a politician who grew up on a Bristol street once dubbed by a newspaper “the most dangerous street in Britain”.
He has risen to the highest levels of government despite the doubts of teachers, career counsellors and others, he says. “They’d say, ‘You can’t do that.’”

Now it is an open secret in Westminster that Javid, whose Pakistani father was a bus driver and who was advised at school to become a television repairman, is preparing to launch an assault on the highest office in the land.
But ambition has earned him enemies. Eurosceptics, furious that he backed Remain in the 2016 referendum, claim he is trying to play both sides of the argument, earning him the nickname “Slippery Saj”.
His handling of the 2016 steel industry crisis, when he was business secretary, saw him portrayed as an uncaring Thatcherite: the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock says Javid’s approach was “based on a toxic blend of indifference and incompetence”. Even Tory sympathisers say his public-speaking style is soporific.
Javid, the first person of colour to hold any of Britain’s great offices of state, dismisses the noise surrounding the Conservatives’ unofficial leadership contest. He insists that he is only focused on his current job, but a Freudian slip gives the game away: “My father passed away a couple of years after I was PM,” he says. “MP,” he laughs, correcting himself. “I said MP.”
His drive is apparent. But for his critics, the question remains: does he have the judgment or skills to make it to the top?
Javid has come to a GlaxoSmithKline site at Stevenage, just north of London, to explain how his post-Brexit immigration policy will still allow companies such as the British pharmaceutical giant to get the skilled workers they need from abroad. Although Javid wants a more liberal regime than May, it is a system that patently would not have allowed his father Abdul — who arrived at Heathrow in 1961 with only a £1 note in his pocket — to come to the UK.
The Javid family settled in Rochdale in the north of England, where Abdul worked in a cotton mill (the country was desperately short of manual workers at the time) and later as a bus driver. Not long after, they headed south to Bristol, where the young Sajid and his four brothers — who went on to successful careers in property, retail, finance and the police — lived with his parents in a two-bedroom flat above their shop, which sold women’s clothes.
His teachers advised him: ‘We think you can only do two A-levels’
“When I look back and reflect on it, it was crowded,” he says. “But you don’t really know anything different.” He says he only became conscious of the cramped conditions when he went to friends’ houses for sleepovers. “But I knew that’s what my parents could afford.”
He was beaten up by a racist bully at school — much later on, in adulthood, the man apologised — but Javid has happy memories of his childhood, much of which was spent playing out on the local streets. “I didn’t think it was tough at the time. It was a lovely home. I had lots of friends, both on my street and in school.”
Though he now owns two properties in London and one in his constituency of Bromsgrove, Javid insists he still feels at home on Bristol’s Stapleton Road where he grew up, in a cosmopolitan district with a large Pakistani community; he occasionally pops into the Monte Carlo Café where he used to play pinball as a youngster.
Javid’s conversational style involves staccato bursts of dialogue and an intense stare. Both are to the fore as he recalls how he ran into a wall of opposition as he tried to plot a route out of Stapleton Road, including from the teachers who were supposed to nurture aspiration.
“Maybe they were trying to make sure you didn’t get too high expectations and then be disappointed,” he says, generously. When he rejected the suggested career in TV repairs, his teachers advised him against taking the three A-levels he needed to get to university. “They said, ‘Well, we think you can only do two.’”
Javid, who still has a soft Bristol burr — he pronounces “was” as “wuz” — had to enrol himself at a local college to continue his studies; by this point, he was already immersing himself in the country’s politics and economics. In the evenings, he would sit with his father, a big fan of Margaret Thatcher, to watch the news and discuss Britain’s industrial decline.

Javid has a portrait of the Iron Lady by his desk at the Home Office and also owes Thatcher for his early interest in finance. He persuaded his father to borrow £500 from the bank so he could buy shares in the newly privatised industries, nipping down to the local library at the weekend to read the FT. He built up a share portfolio but kept this unlikely teenage pastime from his friends.
After succeeding in his A-levels, Javid says he was then told: “Don’t apply to universities that are hard to get into.” He studied economics and politics at Exeter, where he met a group of young Thatcherite Tories who later became influential in the party.
Among them were two future MPs: Rob Halfon — who became George Osborne’s private secretary in 2014 — and David Burrowes, who founded the Conservative Christian Fellowship while at Exeter with fellow student Tim Montgomerie (now a political commentator).
“He was incredibly hard-working but fun and decent,” Halfon remembers. “He had friends outside politics. He was driven.” In 1990, Javid was thrown out of a Tory party conference when he and his friends protested against British participation in the ERM, a precursor to the euro; it was to be the start of his long and tortured relationship with Europe.

Javid’s struggle to break down closed doors also manifested itself in his private life, where some warned that his relationship with his future wife was doomed. He met Laura, with whom he now has four children — three daughters and a son — on a summer placement at Commercial Union, the insurance company. Love blossomed over a communal stapler.
The future home secretary adopted an unusual seduction technique. He recalls telling Laura: “Look, I’m only going to give you this stapler if you have a tuna sandwich with me or something.” Not everyone supported their relationship. “People would say, ‘Are you sure you want to marry her? It could be difficult. She’s white. Don’t you think you should stick to your own kind?’”
The sound of doors slamming continued as Javid attempted to enter a world of banking that was on the cusp of a revolution. “People said I should think about high-street banking,” he recalls. “‘The City is going to be a bit tough. You don’t really have the background.’
“I did have interviews with two British merchant banks, Rothschild and Kleinwort Benson,” he says, adding that his prospective employers were unimpressed by his father’s line of work. “At least I got an interview, but I felt very uncomfortable. In the Rothschild interview, they were all pinstriped, public-school, middle-aged white men. I found it hard to connect and I think they obviously weren’t going to connect.”
Javid believes it is “significant” that he got his break from a US bank — Chase Manhattan — which, unlike its UK counterparts, saw his background as an advantage rather than a drawback. Later, he met the man who had hired him and asked him why: “He said something that has always stuck with me, ‘Because you didn’t have green wellies and you had hunger in your belly.’”
By the age of 25, he’d become a vice-president at Chase, based in New York. He then moved to Deutsche in London at a time of rapid expansion for the European bank, which was squaring up to US rivals by poaching staff from Wall Street with a mandate to innovate and be creative.
It was a fiercely competitive atmosphere, with departments vying for market share and engaging in “internecine warfare at a global level”, according to one former colleague.
Based in the emerging markets team within Deutsche’s fixed income division, Javid was plunged into the “Wild West” of banking. “Nearly all your salary was paid as bonus, so there were huge incentives to make money,” the former colleague remembers. “Deutsche at that time was the birthplace of the credit default swap. There were lots of smart people trying to outdo each other, relentlessly creating new products.”
Another Deutsche colleague remembers Javid as ambitious. “The biggest thing about Sajid was his people skills. He was curious, alive, warm, built good bonds and good relationships.” His talent was not so much in the mathematical wizardry that made some other traders famous; instead, he inspired loyalty in his teams and spurred them on to success.
“He didn’t invent or pioneer anything that I can remember,” the former colleague adds. “I just think of him as a very solid and strong part of the team.”

While much has been made of Javid’s position as one of the very few senior Conservatives of colour, the opposite was true in Deutsche’s international workforce. It was perhaps the time in his life when the future home secretary felt least like an outsider.
“We had an incredible number of minorities and different nationalities and so, actually, when he was here, he was one of the most English ones,” a third former colleague says. “A large proportion of people that worked there at the time were from India, Russia, from all over the place. So he didn’t come across as a minority or any different in that sense at all.”
Javid refuses to disclose his pay but he has never denied the widespread reports that when he quit his job to become an MP for the West Midlands seat of Bromsgrove in 2010 he was earning about £3m a year. “I’m not getting into my pay,” he says. “You can speculate.”
When he arrived at Westminster, Javid was initially reluctant to talk about his “backstory”, thinking it irrelevant, but he says he accepts that people wanted to know what made him tick. Some Tory MPs say that it is still one of the only things they know about him. “Yes, he’s the son of a Pakistani bus driver,” says one. “We know that, but we need to know a bit more.”
If you ask Tory MPs about whether Javid is prime ministerial material, the answer tends to fall into the category: “Yes, but . . .” One rising MP from the 2015 general election intake says: 
“I like Saj but he has never found a way to turn his amazing life story into a platform to tell a big story about what he would like to do with the country.”
A veteran Tory MP nods in agreement: “What does he stand for?” A former cabinet minister wanders across to join the conversation: “He’s a bit managerial, mechanistic. You don’t have to be the prophet Isaiah, but you need a bit of vision.”
Javid may work under the watchful gaze of Margaret Thatcher but his rightwing agenda of free markets and low taxes is complicated by other aspects of his political persona that locate him more at the political centre.
For example, he is more liberal on immigration than May; and the supposed fiscal hawk raised some eyebrows when he suggested the government borrow £50bn to spend on new homes. “Funny money has a tendency to turn into real money,” sighs one Treasury mandarin.
Rob Halfon says his friend’s political views have evolved since their days at Exeter University. “It’s lazy to say that he is a pure Thatcherite now. The difference is that he now believes that economic and social capital have to go hand in hand. He’s a free marketer but he thinks that society is broken and he believes in social justice.”
Javid makes no apology for this political shape-shifting: “I’ve become much less ideological, just pragmatic,” he says.

Javid was identified as a rising star by George Osborne, the former chancellor, who ensured he made a swift and effortless rise through the ministerial ranks, moving from a junior role at the Treasury to culture secretary and then secretary of state for business. “He’s a good decision maker, he’s full of bright ideas,” says a fellow cabinet minister.
But the 2016 Brexit referendum was to prove Javid’s Achilles heel. For Eurosceptics, it suggested a willingness to sell out his principles in the interests of his career. “With Brexit, it’s a head and heart thing with Sajid,” says Halfon. “His heart says out, but his head says in.” Pro-Brexit Tories had long assumed Javid would join the Leave campaign. In the end, after agonising, he backed Remain.
Osborne held at least two meetings with Javid to make it clear to his wobbling colleague that it would be completely unacceptable for a Conservative business secretary to advocate Brexit, when virtually every big company in the land backed Remain. It was dubbed “Operation Sajid”, recalls one friend of the former chancellor. “George got the thumbscrews out.”
Javid insists his decision “wasn’t based on David Cameron or Osborne pressurising me”, or the expectation at the time that Remain would win, or that he would be sacked if he backed Leave, but on a hard-headed economic judgment. “I don’t regret my decision at all,” Javid says. He says his focus now is on delivering the Brexit decision.
Saj has brilliant PR but few real convictions
A senior figure on the pro-Brexit Tory European Research Group
To this day, he is mistrusted by Tory Eurosceptics, who are unconvinced by his recent efforts to strike tough poses on Brexit. “Saj has brilliant PR but few real convictions,” says one senior figure on the pro-Brexit Tory European Research Group.
“He entered the House as a staunch Eurosceptic, then in 2016 he completely bottled it. The next leader has to be a Brexiteer. When it mattered, Saj was a Remainer. End of.”
Amid the political rubble that constituted the Conservative party after the 2016 Brexit vote, Javid backed the long-forgotten leadership campaign of Stephen Crabb, once seen as a rising star of the Tory centre-left, then forlornly waited to be sacked after Theresa May seized the party crown from the departing Cameron.
May, the former home secretary, had never much liked Javid. She despised Osborne, who tried to frustrate her attempts to clamp down on immigration, and Javid was his protégé. Javid’s stock had also fallen earlier that year over his initial reluctance to bail out the ailing British steel industry. “He’s an ultra-Thatcherite libertarian,” says Stephen Kinnock, who, as MP for Aberavon, represents workers at the Port Talbot plant. 
But against Javid’s expectations — possibly related to the fact that May’s promise to tackle inequality might ring hollow if she appointed an almost exclusively white cabinet — the prime minister gave him the local government portfolio. He says he has no idea why May kept him on: “We’re not the best of buddies. But then that’s not my objective. The cabinet functions well when you’ve got good people around the table who take their jobs seriously and you’ve got a prime minister who gives it her all.”

In 2018, Javid was promoted by May to his current post in the wake of the so-called Windrush scandal. Amber Rudd was forced to quit as home secretary over the mistreatment by her department over many years of British citizens who arrived from the Caribbean in the 1950s and 1960s to fill a labour shortage and who suffered under the “hostile environment” created by May during her six years at the Home Office.
Putting Javid in charge at such a sensitive time made sense, given his personal background, but for May it meant handing over her old department — and immigration policy — to a man who was now almost unsackable.
Javid disowned the “hostile environment” policy, although critics say that elements persist. He then overthrew May’s longstanding opposition to the legalisation of cannabis for medicinal use. “I don’t care what she says,” Javid told friends at the time.
“I want to change people’s views of the Home Office that we are trying to keep people out,” he says. He strongly disagrees with May that “highly skilled” workers should be defined as anyone earning more than £30,000: he wants the threshold to be set much lower. By the time the policy is finalised, May could be gone.
His liberal instincts on immigration stem from a belief in free markets as much as from his own background. On other subjects, he has seemed further to the right than some of his cabinet peers. Last year he was criticised for tweeting about “sick Asian paedophiles” in reference to the conviction of a Huddersfield grooming gang.
The Labour MP David Lammy said: “By singling out ‘Asians’ he not only panders to the far right but increases the risk of violence and abuse against minorities across the country . . . Paedophilia is an abhorrent crime that affects all communities.” 
Javid also prompted concern from human rights groups after deciding not to require assurances from the US government that a pair of British Isis militants would not face the death penalty if they were extradited.
With Brexit, his heart says out but his head says in
Tory MP Rob Halfon
As home secretary, he faces multiple challenges: he will have to manage Brexit arrangements in security and at the border, battle a significant rise in murder and violence after more than a decade of falling crime levels — police chiefs blame cuts made during May’s time at the Home Office — and lobby tech companies to fight terrorism and child sexual exploitation online.
Officials say they feel he has their back; their only concern is whether he has the necessary focus to keep abreast of everything put in front of him. “Whatever you think of Theresa May, she was on top of the detail. You put something in the box, and she read it,” one says. “He doesn’t have the same reputation for fearlessly ploughing on with the work whatever it takes.”
Most Tory MPs believe one of the candidates on a final two-person shortlist for the next prime minister will be a hardline Brexiter — maybe Michael Gove, Boris Johnson or Dominic Raab. But Javid is the frontrunner to be the other name: a more centrist, Brexit-lite candidate, capable of uniting both wings of a party that is in danger of ripping itself apart, battling for that slot with foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt.

His enemies are waiting. “Number 10 are out to get him,” says one cabinet minister, observing that May wanted to clip Javid’s wings. When a relatively small number of migrants crossed the English Channel over Christmas, Downing Street made it clear that Javid should return from a luxury holiday in South Africa to deal with it. The Javid camp believe Number 10 briefed the press on details of his trip, said to include an £840 a person a night stay in Kruger National Park. 
Javid says he never even made it to the safari part of his holiday. Stories appeared around the same time that Javid had begun referring to himself as “The Saj” in meetings. “I’ve never called myself The Saj,” he says with mock seriousness. “But I’ve noticed a lot of people do. I was even thinking of changing my Twitter handle to The Saj.”
Then there is his austere public persona, which gives no glimpse of his more engaging private side. His speeches are delivered with the flair of a speak-your-weight machine. “He’s the most boring speaker in the cabinet,” says one mainstream Tory MP.
The home secretary has been taking lessons to improve his delivery, say allies, but the results have so far gone unnoticed by colleagues. At the last Tory conference, there were empty seats for a flat speech in which he accidentally vowed to “fight hope”.
“I think I can improve,” he says. “I think I have improved a bit with practice.” He admires the fluency of Michael Gove, the environment secretary who honed his oratory at the Oxford Union, and acknowledges: “I think it’s something I can invest more in and think more about, because communication is key as a politician.”
For all the criticism of his stiff manner and his political flexibility, some believe he can still reach the political summit. One cabinet minister says: “He can reach parts of the party that others can’t reach.
“When it’s going well for Saj, the moderates in the party like him for what he represents. The right like him because he is as dry as dust and has proper Conservative values.”
A lot depends on whether the vacancy arises in the midst of the Brexit crisis or at a calmer moment. Another cabinet minister says: “If there was a leadership contest now, it wouldn’t be Saj — it would be a Brexiteer. It helps him if it’s post-Brexit.”
I don’t regret the [Brexit] decision at all
Another government figure says that while Hunt may have more charm than Javid, the latter has a steelier edge. “You can imagine Jeremy being told that a plane with terrorists on board is heading towards London with fighter planes on its tail and being asked what to do, and he would say, ‘Well . . . ’ Saj would say, ‘Shoot it down.’”
Trevor Phillips, former head of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, who knows the home secretary, has a hunch that being an outsider could ultimately work to Javid’s advantage: “If you come from the outside and you work on the premise that you will never be part of the club, you work in a way which means you never have to rely on anyone,” he says. “Therefore, nobody can let you down.”
When asked by the FT if he’d like to be PM, Javid does not deny it outright, instead adopting the familiar politician’s manoeuvre of answering a different question. “Well, I like being home secretary, I love that job.” But most ambitious ministers dream of leading the country, don’t they? “Well, you meet many of them, so if that’s what you think,” he replies, smiling. “Look, I’m focused on this job.” 
Javid apologises that he has to return to London for further Brexit meetings and heads towards his armoured car. The door is already open for him.

You can rest easy … for now CNBC What impact will robots and artificial intelligence have in the years to come?,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/08/worried-about-robots-taking-your-job-you-can-rest-easy--for-now-.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-08T09:42:09Z,"The subject of artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential ramifications generates a significant amount of debate and discussion. 
AI can mean different things to different people. Some may think of it as a catch all term for ""smart robots"" that can think like humans, but it's a bit more nuanced than that. For its part, analytics business SAS states that AI ""makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs and perform human-like tasks.""
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
Some have expressed genuine concern about the ramifications of AI. In 2014 the late scientist Stephen Hawking told the BBC that the ""development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race."" In 2017, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos took a slightly different view when he said that we were in something of a ""renaissance"" and ""golden age"" when it came to the subjects of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
Last month, a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, looked at the topic again. According to one participant in the discussion, chaired by CNBC's Steve Sedgwick, we're still ""way, way behind having thinking robots that will do the work of humans."" 
""The key about AI is data,"" Christopher A. Pissarides, professor of economics at the London School of Economics, went on to explain. ""You need to have very large amounts of data with AI, and then it's programmed to interpret the data in certain ways."" 
Using chess as an example, Pissarides said computers were ""very good"" at the game because there were masses of data on moves from the past. ""But anything new, anything that you need to stretch the way you are thinking about something, it (AI) won't be able to do,"" he added.
Looking at industrial data and where robots are in relation to automation, Pissarides said that the ""automotive industry, by far, dominates. If you remove the automotive industry you'll probably be left with no robots anywhere in industry, except for isolated cases."""
216,Genentech Uses Virtual Reality to Train Eye Surgeons,"Genentech, a division of Roche Holding AG, is using virtual reality as a training tool for eye surgeons in a clinical trial that executives expect will be the beginning of widespread use of the technology.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/genentech-uses-virtual-reality-to-train-eye-surgeons-11549495028,"{'id': 'the-wall-street-journal', 'name': 'The Wall Street Journal'}",2019-02-06T23:17:10Z,"Genentech, a division of
Roche Holding AG
, is using virtual reality as a training tool for eye surgeons in a clinical trial that executives expect will be the beginning of widespread use of the technology.Over the past year, more than 150 surgeons have used VR to simulate a surgical procedure treating wet age-related macular degeneration, an eye disease that affects more than 1 million people age 50 and older in the U.S.The surgery requires the implant in the eye of a device, roughly the size of a grain of rice, that continuously releases a drug for the treatment of the disease.
If the device in the clinical trial is approved by the Food and Drug Administration in a few years, Genentech expects to train the more than 2,200 retinal specialists in the U.S. Virtual reality will be a major component of that training in order for them to master the procedure, the company said.
Historically, surgeons had to learn on patients. What were trying to do here is see all the possible permutations that can occur, in virtual reality, so that when [the surgeons] are actually doing this on a patient, theyre ready, said Anthony Adamis, senior vice president of development innovation for Genentech. 
In virtual reality, users wear headsets in which they can see digitized representations of the real world. Movements, such as as turning ones head, and other actions have outcomes within the digital representation.
Other industries outside of health care use virtual reality in training. United Parcel Service Inc., for example, is using virtual reality to simulate the experience of driving its iconic brown delivery trucks before new drivers hit the road.
Walmart Inc.recently developed a management training program in which much of the training takes place in virtual reality.
Worldwide spending on virtual reality and augmented reality, which superimposes digital images onto a users view of the real world, is expected to reach nearly $20.4 billion this year, according to market intelligence firm International Data Corp. Thats up from an estimated $12.1 billion in 2018.
Genentech took inspiration from the commercial aviation sector, where flight has become safer in part because of simulated training, Dr. Adamis said. 
Some of the VR training for eye surgeons in the clinical trial takes place at Genentechs South San Francisco campus. The surgeons use a workstation that includes a virtual reality headset and a physical replica of the human eye and replicas of surgical tools. Surgeons are trained in virtual reality on how to implant the device that contains the drug and also how to refill the device. The surgeons can move the physical replicas of tools onto the physical replica of the human eye, which also appear digitized in the headset, to simulate the act of surgery.
The VR headsets and technology are provided by Germany-based VRmagic.
Genentech has invested well over $1 million over the past three years in virtual reality equipment and development of the surgical training program, said Christopher Brittain, interim global head of clinical ophthalmology for Genentech.
A 2017 study in Ophthalmology, the journal of the American Academy of Ophthalmology, showed that novice cataract surgeons showed significant improvement after training in virtual reality simulations.
Until the mid-2000s, there was treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration, but it only slowed the progression of the disease, which could result in eventual blindness. There was also no way to restore vision loss until the approval of a Genentech drug in 2006, when the rate of blindness from the disease dropped by about 50%, Dr. Brittain said. Current treatment requires eye injections as often as monthly.
If approved by the FDA, the surgical implant to treat the disease would go a long way in reducing the burden of having to visit the doctor monthly, which is why virtual reality surgical training is so critical, he said. Virtual reality is really going to make sure that every surgeon is as ready as they possibly can be to perform these surgeries, Dr. Brittain said.

Science backs up the project's mission. What people eat directly affects climate change, a study published in Nature found. In order to keep global warming under 2 degrees Celsius, people around the world would need to eat a lot less meat. (Temperatures are already up 1 degree above pre-industrial levels and are on track to go up a disastrous 3 to 5 degrees if no changes are made.)
Greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions ""cannot be sufficiently mitigated without dietary changes towards more plant-based diets,"" the study says.
In other words, Beyonce is on to something: Changing what you consume could actually be the most important thing you do, researchers found, since ""dietary change contributes the most to the reductions in GHG emissions.""
Although the Greenprint website encourages contestants to adopt a plant-based diet, the sweepstakes itself seems to be based on the honor system. Your deadline to enter is April 22, and a winner will be chosen at random on May 22.

""This funding and partnership will accelerate our mission of delivering the benefits of self-driving technology safely, quickly, and broadly,"" Aurora said. Aurora's management has a lot of experience in the automotive industry.
The company's CEO and co-founder Chris Urmson is the former CTO of self-driving cars at Alphabet, which owns the autonomous vehicle firm Waymo. Co-founder and chief product officer Sterling Anderson led the design and launch of the Tesla Model X, according to Aurora's website. Drew Bagnell, Aurora's chief technology officer and co-founder helped found Uber's Advanced Technology Center.
""We are always looking to invest in innovative, customer-obsessed companies, and Aurora is just that,"" Amazon told CNBC in a statement. ""Autonomous technology has the potential to help make the jobs of our employees and partners safer and more productive, whether it's in a fulfillment center or on the road, and we're excited about the possibilities.""
The Wall Street Journal said last year that Amazon has a team dedicated to building autonomous vehicle technology. Amazon also announced a partnership with Toyota last year that will help Amazon explore ways to use self-driving cars to deliver food. Earlier this week, CNBC reported that Amazon is already hauling cargo in self-driving trucks developed by Embark.
Rather than manufacturing its own vehicles, Aurora is working with incumbents like VW and Hyundai, as well as Byton in China, to develop self-driving cars. It competes with not just Waymo, but other venture backed start-ups like Zoox, and self-driving companies acquired by Ford and GM, Argo.AI and Cruise, respectively.
Neither Amazon nor Aurora revealed just how much of the investment came from Amazon.

The company surpassedMicrosoft and Amazon Wednesday with a market capitalization of $821.59 billion. Microsoft ended the trading day with a market value of $813.48 billion and Amazon ended the day with a market value of $805.70 billion. The three companies have been in a tight race for the top spot since late last year, with Microsoft ending 2018 on top and Amazon briefly stealing the crown.
But the recent earnings season has swung the pendulum back in Apple's favor. Apple suffered a steep loss in market value in early January after warning investors to expect weak revenue for its first quarter 2019. In the three months leading up to the warning, investors already anticipated the revenue drop and Apple's market cap bled $452 billion.
Apple's warning tempered expectations so effectively that its actual earnings report was well-received. The stock soared nearly 7 percent the day after Apple's report, where it proved strong services margins even as its iPhone revenue was down 15 percent.
Amazon and Microsoft's earnings reports, on the other hand, under-delivered compared to analysts' expectations. Microsoft fell as much as 4 percent after missing on revenue and providing light guidance. Amazon initially rose on its earnings and revenue beat, but fell sharply once executives revealed on the call with analysts that the company will ramp up investments in hiring and capital expenditure this year and noted concerns around new regulation in India. The stock even fell into bear market territory on Friday, dropping below $800 billion in market value.

The piece, which shot Mr Wolfson to fame when it was shown at Art Basel in 2014, is an animatronic woman. Blonde tresses curl down her back; she is smudged with dirt and dressed in thigh-high patent boots and a short, white dress. She jolts and lurches through a seductive dance while her eyes, dark and deadly, glow behind a creepy green mask. A deep male voice emanates from her and says: My mothers dead, my fathers dead, Im gay, Id like to be a poet, this is my house. Fitted with a motion sensor, she locks eyes with viewers in the room.
A similarly unnerving art-robot makes an early appearance in Velvet Buzzsaw, a new comic-horror film released on Netflix on February 1st. It focuses on the greedy wheeler-dealers of the contemporary art scene. Morf Vanderwalt (played with deadpan seriousness by Jake Gyllenhaal), a renowned critic, swans into the Miami edition of Art Basel in a slick blue suit. He swaps his aviators for thick horn-rimmed glasses to contemplate Hoboman, a creation that could easily be the male counterpart of Female Figure. Do you ever feel invisible? the robot asks. Morf raises his eyebrows. No originality! he scoffs. The viewer gets a preview of what is to come when the camera zooms in on the humanoid installation and it seems to bare its teeth.

Morf and his associates are unsparing in their judgments and fixated on finding the next big thing, whatever it takes. The plot centres on a collection of paintings discovered by Josephina (Zawe Ashton), an ambitious young gallery assistant. An old man in her building dies, and when she lets herself into his apartment that evening she finds a huge stash of works, some rolled up, others partially burned, some pasted on the walls. The dead man, Ventril Dease, a reclusive janitor, made it explicitly clear that he wanted these paintings destroyed, but Josephina spies the chance to make a master out of an outsider artistand, of course, the chance to make her name and a lot of cash. The art, hilariously, looks sloppy and amateurish, rather a lot like the AI-generated painting which Christies sold in December for $432,500, nearly 45 times higher than its estimate.
Rhodora (Rene Russo), Josephinas conniving bossa former punk star who has undergone a transformation from anarchist to purveyor of good tasteis quick to spot the business opportunity, too, and a web of sneaky underhand deals take place. It is then that things turn kitschy and supernatural: the artworks that these characters want to exploit for financial gain start to seek their revenge. 
The film works best when it embraces this B-grade-slasher-meets-mid-afternoon-soap-opera feel. Almost every single character in Velvet Buzzsaw is extravagantly awful; the funniest scenes are the ones where they meet imaginatively gruesome ends. Gretchen (Toni Collette), a public-museum curator turned art advisor to the rich, is hacked up by a piece of artwork called Sphere (it has a striking resemblance to one of Anish Kapoors orb-like sculptures); her blood is stomped across the gallery by schoolchildren who think her remains are an interactive part of the installation. Abstract technicolour paintings slip off the wall and transform one character into a petrified 2-D version of herself. One gallerist is found hung at the centre of an installation. At least at the beginning of the carnage, Mort remains lofty and disparaging. That casket, what colour is that? Smog orange? Did they buy it on sale? he says at a funeral. Seriously, imagine having to spend an eternity in that.
Ive always been intrigued with people chasing money, Dan Gilroy, the director, has said. They become really sad and tragic and really funny. The characters in the film, all crazed in their pursuit of riches and power, are indeed very entertaining. But Velvet Buzzsaw has a tendency to beat the viewer over the head with its moralising about the art worlds seamier side and how greed, ambition and wealth interfere with beauty. None of this is particularly new or enlighteningThe Price of Everything, a recent documentary, probed the often-skewed relationship between artistic and monetary value. 
Yet after all this, the film ends by reminding viewers that it is possible to read too much into art. Piers (John Malkovich), an aggressively austere artist, stands alone on a beach. Earlier he admonished a gallerist who came to visit his studio and mistook a pile of rubbish bags for a new work. Here, clothed in natural fibres, he is tracing something in the sand with a stick. It is tempting to think that the camera will pan out to a revelatory tableau, or at least something that will help to explain the colourful, chaotic, farcical mess that was the past 113 minutes of the film. It turns out, though, that Piers is just doodling.
Velvet Buzzsaw is available on Netflix now"
223,"Humana executives say Trump's drug rebate proposal would raise premiums, restrict consumer choice","The Trump administration's plan to force insurers to pass on drug maker discounts to seniors at the pharmacy counter would upend the market and raise consumer premiums in the end, health insurance executives warned investors this week.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/08/how-drug-rebate-proposal-could-disrupt-medicare-drug-plans.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-08T18:39:00Z,"The move would require individual drug discounts to be passed directly to those buying high-cost drugs at the pharmacy counter to reduce their out of pocket costs. But some argue that those discounts are now used to lower overall drug plan insurance premiums, so the proposal would likely result in higher premiums and less consumer choice, executives said. It also presents a major challenge for companies now with an uncertain future and planning to determine coverage for 2020 beginning this spring. 
""As a company we completely support what the administration is trying to do to lower the drug costs. We believe that's the right thing to do,"" said Bruce Broussard, Humana CEO on the company's earnings call with analysts Wednesday. But the proposal comes down to ""just reallocating dollars.""
Humana executives say seniors in the standalone Medicare Part D market are drawn to plans with the lowest monthly premium costs. This year that will result in the company's co-branded Medicare Part D plan with Walmart losing market share to competitors that offered cheaper plans; the company forecast a decline of 700,000 to 750,000 in its Part D enrollments for 2019.
Humana reported fourth-quarter profits of $2.65 per share, which exceeded Wall Street analyst estimates, on revenues of $14.2 billion which also topped expectations. Despite warning of lower Part D prescription drug plan enrollment for 2019, the insurer reaffirmed its expectation that its Medicare Advantage growth will be on track to add more than 375,000 members."
224,How TV Took Over Sundance,"What was once a meeting for the movie industry has now become a summit for the small screen, writes Stacey Wilson Hunt.",http://fortune.com/2019/02/01/television-sundance/,"{'id': 'fortune', 'name': 'Fortune'}",2019-02-01T16:10:23Z,"PARK CITY, UtahA stroll along Main Street during opening weekend of this years Sundance Film Festival offered what seemed to be a typical slew of A-list industry happenings.
But something felt different.
The Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN) previewed its anticipated new drama David Makes Man from Oscar-winning screenwriter Tarell Alvin McCraney. Turner Broadcasting promoted the TNT limited-series I Am the Night and TBSs Steve Buscemi comedy Miracle Workers. HBO hosted an invite-only dinner for its acquisition of a24s Native Son. Showtime threw a party in honor of its veteran dramedy Shameless…just because. IFC premiered season four of Documentary Now!; hours later, Starz hosted a silent disco party for Now Apocalypse, from filmmaker Greg Araki. Actor Chris ODowd and writer Nick Hornby teased their upcoming 10-minute-long comedy series on SundanceTV, State of the Union. Oh, and hip-hop icons The Wu-Tang Clan performed a late-night set for 400 people in honor of Showtimes pre-fest-acquisition of the groups docu-series Of Mics and Men.
And yes, there were movies, too.
In an era of too-much-TV, in which pay-cable networks and streaming companies place as much value on awards and A-list talent deals as eyeballs, small-screen entertainment is now an undeniable force at the festival. Since 2013, when 266 fans sat through seven, hour-long episodes of Jane Campions SundanceTV drama Top of the Lake, the 38-year-old fest has become a hotbed of cachet-boosting premiere events, a bustling marketplace for buying hot propertieslike this years Native Son sale to HBO and the Indian-made, seven-part Delhi Crime Story to Netflixand a compelling venue for pitch-meeting-weary TV execs to experience new talent in a more organic, artistic setting.
The bottom has fallen out of the mid-budget independent film space, so many of our veteran filmmakers, people like Steven Soderbergh, Jane Campion, Greg Araki are all working in TV, says the Sundance Institutes Charlie Sexto, who reports that the festival received a record 471 submissions for episodic content this year, including for its Indie Episodic program, which was created last year to showcase fringier, edgier content.
Ive been attending Sundance for over 20 years, since my days as a film executive, says Amy Israel, Showtimes EVP of Scripted Programming. The festival remains [for me] an essential forum for showcasing emerging talent, both in front of and behind the camera. Israels competitors agree: At the 2018 festival, Starz acquired Hoop Dreams director Steve James Chicago-set docu-series, America to Me; FX took home the American distribution rights to the Australian drama Mr. Inbetween, which did well enough to earn a second season; and HBO Latino is currently streaming the short-form digital series High &amp; Mighty.
Our original vision, as conceived by Redford, was to showcase artists in ways that reflect the industry, Sexto says. So to us, this all feels like a natural evolution.”
It feels that way to indie-filmmakers-turned-TV-creators like Mark Duplass, who debuted at the fest in 2005 with his brother Jay with their film Puffy Chair. He says he experience as a producer on the animated series Animals, which HBO purchased after its first two episodes screened at the 2015 festival, signaled a powerful shift for him in how certain types of shows (read: niche, dark, weird) are often best pitched to TV executives in their completed form. There was excitement about buying a series that you could see first, a privilege that TV buyers rarely have, and that fervor sparked some of the heat that ultimately created a bidding war for Animals, says Duplass. I love bringing that gambling spirit of indie film to TV.
In the last decade, many of Sundances short-film competitors (a separate designation from episodic) have also seen their work go on to thrive on the small-screen after they leave Park City. In 2010, producers Jeremy Konner and Derek Waters Drunk History, wherein comedian Jen Kirkman gets drunk and details the friendship between Abraham Lincoln (Will Ferrell) and Frederick Douglass (Don Cheadle), nabbed a coveted festival Jury Prize and later became an 11-time Emmy-nominated series on Comedy Central.
In 2015, actor/director Frankie Shaws eight-minute film SMILF, about the messy sex life of a young single mom, took home the Jury Prize for U.S. Fiction; an accolade Shaw says directly facilitated selling the concept to Showtime. We pitched SMILF as a show a few weeks after the festival; having the Sundance stamp legitimized the project, Shaw says of her Golden Globe-nominated dramedy, which is currently airing its second season on the pay-cable network. (ABC Studios, which produces SMILF, is currently investigating Shaw following complaints including that she mishandled a nude scene. I was learning on the go, Shaw said on the Today Show last month.)
Outside of Amazons gangbusters spending on three films this year, an estimated $41 million total for comedies Late Night and Brittany Runs a Marathon, and the CIA thriller The Report, overall sales for 2019 have been mild. Its a reality not lost on director Rashid Johnson, who wanted his raw, modern retelling of Richard Wrights Native Son to debut at Sundance specifically because it offers the highest concentration of discerning buyers, whether TV or film. The most important thing was finding a distributor that felt as strongly about our film as we did, says Johnson. After meeting with HBO, we knew wed found a partner who shared our enthusiasm.
On the afternoon of January 29, when many Hollywood suits had returned to sea level, Sundances Prospector Theater was surprisingly packed (especially for day six of the fest). Taking the stage to introduce a portion of this years Indie Episodic creators, Sundance programming executive Adam Montgomery offered a chuckle-worthy appraisal of why TV matters here, more than ever. Theres been this traditional studio system for episodic content: you pitch an idea to a studio or network, they buy it and proceed to suck out every ounce of your creative control,” he said. “We wanted to show that there was a marketplace for independently-produced episodic content the same way there was for film.
That was the hope of L.A.-based writer/actor and Sundance newbie Ali Liebegott, whose eight-minute entry Girls Weekendabout a 47-year-old queer woman visiting her conservative family, and directed by actor Kyra Sedgwickwas featured in the program. But dwelling too much on OK, what now? may distract from an equally impressive milestone. Its a dream to have been at Sundance with a project I wrote and acted in, says Liebegott. I still can’t believe any of this happened."
225,Investors urge tech start-ups to hoard cash,VC groups say the slowing economy will make fundraising more difficult,https://www.ft.com/content/44c3564c-231f-11e9-8ce6-5db4543da632,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-03T04:00:25Z,"Venture capital investors are warning their start-ups to hold more cash as worries about the global economy and stock market volatility threaten to trickle down into private tech financings. 
“We are certainly telling [entrepreneurs] they need 18 to 24 months of runway right now, to make sure they can weather any situation,” said Danny Rimer, a partner at Index Ventures. 
Just a year ago, Mr Rimer would recommend companies to hold enough cash to cover nine to 12 months’ worth of expenditures and delay raising new funds if they thought they believed they could achieve higher valuations in future. Now, he suggests start-ups seek more capital sooner rather than later, and at more modest valuations. 
Ten years ago, Silicon Valley venture firm Sequoia sparked concerns about a tech bubble with a presentation to its entrepreneurs declaring “RIP good times”. Sequoia’s presentation, which was sent out to portfolio companies at the height of the financial crisis in late-2008, warned that any start-up without a year’s worth of cash in the bank could find itself in trouble as the economy slowed.
While investors are not yet using such dramatic language, some have warned tech companies that a downturn in the economy could cause bigger businesses to cut IT spending and make it more difficult for funds to raise capital. 
“We’ve started to be a little more cautious about that run rate . . . it should be a year or one-and-a-half years,” said Klaus Hommels, founder and chief executive of Zurich-based venture firm Lakestar. “The likelihood of being refinanced and achieving a huge valuation is less.”
SoftBank’s decision to slash a planned investment in WeWork, the shared office company, from $16bn to $2bn has also led to fears that valuations for private tech companies will come down, just as they have for high-flying public tech companies such as Nvidia, Snap or Apple in recent months. 
However, some investors say there is far more capital available for tech companies now than in 2008. Investment has flowed into both traditional venture capital firms and later-stage funds such as Softbank’s $97bn Vision Fund, in search of better returns while interest rates remained low. 
This year we want to look at all the companies in the portfolio and see they have enough cash in the bank 
Lars Fjeldsoe-Nielsen, Balderton Capital
Nonetheless, despite the emergence of more start-ups with multibillion-dollar valuations, tech start-ups are still seen as a riskier investment than the public markets. 
UK augmented-reality start-up Blippar was forced into administration before Christmas after a shareholder dispute over funding when Malaysia’s sovereign wealth fund blocked emergency investment from property tycoon Nick Candy. Last month, the company relaunched under the same name after Mr Candy’s investment firm bought its intellectual property assets.
It is not uncommon for tech start-ups to end the year without enough cash to cover a year’s worth of costs, in anticipation of future funding rounds.
According to its most recent public filings, London-based artificial intelligence start-up BenevolentAI, which is valued at more than $1bn, had £19.6m of cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2017, but that year recorded research, development and administrative expenses of £36.7m. The figure includes £12.2m of share-based payments that only impact cash holdings when employees leave.
But the following April, the company was able to raise $115m from investors including Woodford Investment Management. 
For investors, the concern is that start-ups founded in the last 10 years will only have experienced a strong economy and could be unprepared for a downturn. 
“This year we want to look at all the companies in the portfolio and see they have enough cash in the bank,” said Lars Fjeldsoe-Nielsen, general partner at Balderton Capital. “There are some companies that are burning a lot of cash right now . . . many of the companies we invest in haven’t seen the downside.”"

Meeks, who ran the world's biggest tech fund for Merrill Lynch in the late 1990s and early 2000s, expects the tech-heavy Nasdaq to end the year at least 10 percent higher.
""I'm starting to creep out of the bunker,"" he said Friday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" ""I would say that when you get to December 31 of this year, the Nasdaq will be up double digit in calendar 2019. And, it will outperform both the Dow and the S&amp;P [500 Index].""
It's a material shift for Meeks. Late last year, he was telling investors that most tech names were ""uninvestable."" Now, he believes tech valuations have come down enough to start putting money to work again as long as it's done with vigilance.
""Some companies are doing quite well, and some are giving very mixed even bearish guidance. So you have to be super careful,"" he said.
For example, when it comes to FANG names Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet, Meeks owns them all. However, he wouldn't add positions to all of them right now.
""The only one I think I would buy here because I think it is the best among the group combination of valuation support and upside potential is Alphabet,"" he said.
According to Meeks, tech stocks could still see some near-term turbulence especially around the U.S.-China trade war deadline on March 1. However, the investment picture should begin to improve after that.
""A lot of the gains are going to come between the summer and the end of the year a second half phenomenon,"" Meeks said.
For the week ending Friday, the Nasdaq is up a half percent, and it remains in correction territory."

A new analysis by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) found Apple's HomePod makes up only 6 percent of the 66 million units that make up the U.S. installed base of smart speaker devices.
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
As the number of active smart speaker devices continues to grow, Apple's has failed to keep up with the rest of the market. The Google Home makes up 24 percent of the U.S. installed base and Amazon's Alexa-enabled Echo accounts for 70 percent, according to the report.
Apple's HomePod, at $349, is more expensive and more limited than other smart speaker devices. By comparison, Google offers smart speakers starting at $29.99 and Amazon offers them starting at $19.99. While the HomePod prides itself on high-quality audio and the fact that it does not store conversations in the cloud as other devices do, the number of services it supports is narrower compared to its competitors. Siri will only listen to commands to play music from Apple's own streaming service, and playing from other services, like Spotify, require a more complicated set-up.
Apple has shifted its strategy around Apple Music, beginning to offer the service on smart speakers that hold more market share. In November, Amazon said Apple Music would be available on the Echo, marking a rare collaboration between the two companies. The move comes as Apple looks outside its own closed-off ecosystem to drive more subscribers for its services.
CIRP Co-Founder and Partner Mike Levin said Amazon and Google's strategies of offering lower priced devices so people can own more than one in their home seems to be working. The report said 35 percent of smart speaker owners have more than one device as of the December 2018 quarter, compared to 18 percent the year before.
""Their strategies appear to include persuading owners to use smart speakers in multiple rooms, which helps create more active usage of the voice platform,"" Levin said of Amazon and Google. ""And, Google has mostly caught up to Amazon in this strategy. A year ago, almost twice the percentage of Amazon Echo users had multiple units as Google Home users. Now, about one-third of both Amazon Echo and Google Home users have multiple units.""

Chatterjee notes that the purchase would likely command a sizable premium. If that premium was 20 percent, it would likely cost Apple $189 billion, the analyst speculates. Netflix has current market value of $148 billion and $7 billion in net debt. 
The note from Chatterjee outlines three industries the firm thinks would be a good fit for Apple to make strategic acquisitions and names three firms the company should buy including Netflix, Activision Blizzard and Sonos. This is speculation from Chatterjee but comes as Apple long run of growth from the iPhone begins to dwindle.
The analyst is just speculating in the note and does not have any information that a deal is on the table. Chatterjee even notes how the combination of Apple-Netflix is unlikely.
""We believe Apple can drive synergies between its leading position in smartphones and the rapid transition of video consumption to mobile to drive stronger services growth,"" Chatterjee said. ""We find Netflix as the best strategic fit, although we appreciate a combination is less likely as Netflix is unlikely to be a seller for a modest premium.""

That was a big takeaway this week from the Paris Fintech Forum, one of the biggest annual gatherings of its kind in Europe. On Tuesday and Wednesday, about 3,000 entrepreneurs, investors, bankers, and regulators descended on the neo-classical Palais Brongniart, once home to the stock exchange. Last year, with Bitcoin and its imitators soaring, attendees jammed discussions on blockchain technology.
“I nearly lost my whole team to cryptocurrencies,” said Will Andrich, the CEO of Switzerlands Thaler. One, which says it creates real estate-backed digital securities.
No such problem this year. With the top 10 crypto assets down 80 percent in the last 12 months and skepticism mounting, many fintech pros concluded that the technology may not be ready for prime time, especially in an industry this heavily regulated.
Instead, the conference was about getting back to banking basics. Sessions on building branchless lenders were standing-room only, investors buzzed about how 2019 could be a banner dealmaking year, and the most controversial moment came at a panel on old-fashioned lending.
Backstage, luminaries from traditional finance and the startup world sipped coffee and geeked out. Fresh from Davos, Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, chatted with Kathryn Petralia, a co-founder of Kabbage Inc., an Atlanta-based firm that does automated credit scoring and lending. On stage, the governor of the Bank of France, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, held forth on artificial intelligence with Olivier Guersent, the director-general of financial stability at the European Commission. “Im pretty excited about supply chains,” said Ann Cairns, the vice chairman of Mastercard Inc.
With Europes new payments law now requiring banks to share customer account data with fintech firms, the prevailing vibe was that theres plenty of action without messing around with crypto.
Perhaps nothing drove that point home more than the face-off between Gottfried Leibbrandt, the chief executive officer of Swift, and Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of San Franciscos Ripple Labs Inc. Swift is a 46-year-old cooperative that directs trillions of dollars in cross-border payments between thousands of banks. Garlinghouse has repeatedly vowed to leapfrog Swifts 1970s-conceived system with a faster, cheaper blockchain-like one.
I look at the dynamic between Ripple and Swift, and I liken it to Amazon and Wal-Mart, Garlinghouse said on Wednesday to a packed auditorium.
Leibbrandt countered that for two years, Swifts latest payment standard revitalized its system, letting customers track a payment like a FedEx package, and cutting transfer time to hours. Unlike Ripple, which has struggled to sign up major banks, Leibbrandt said the worlds top 60 lenders are utilizing its technology, which is already embraced by regulators.
Banks are not ready for a model where you convert into a crypto and then convert back again, Leibbrandt said. Its not clear to us that blockchain is better than what we have today.
This week, the hot fintech jargon was Banking-as-a-Service. A more apt moniker might be Bank-in-a-Box: these ventures create digital versions of products ranging from debit cards to money transfer to account-management tools, which customers can rebrand as their own. Antony Jenkins, the former CEO of Barclays Plc, runs an outfit called 10x that has made inroads in this space.
Were commoditizing everything that a bank does, said Brad van Leeuwen, head of partnerships at London-based Railsbank Ltd., as he showed a menu of offerings to prospects. Railsbank, whose slogan is Banking in Five Lines of Code, is capitalizing on the spread of inexpensive open source software and cloud computing.
Some ventures, like solarisBank AG, obtained bank licenses so they could make loans through partners and sell software to support payment cards and other products to upstarts. Traditionally, banks are not good at dealing with clients, so we enable those fintechs to move in on their turf, said Roland Folz, the CEO of Berlin-based solarisBank.
Things were less rosy in the online lending space. The underwhelming initial public offering and share slump by Funding Circle Holdings Plc, the No. 1 peer-to-peer loans outfit in the U.K., cast a pall. Then, theres Brexit.
Christian Faes, the CEO and co-founder of mortgage lender LendInvest Ltd., said his firm is originating between 20 and 30 million pounds ($39 million) per month in loans to residential landlords after moving into the market in 2017, with funding from Citigroup Inc. Hed like to expand into mainstream mortgages, too, but its harder to attract backers right now. Brexit is not ideal, said Faes, nursing a glass of red wine across from the exhibition hall. The market for institutional money has been shut down until Brexit is sorted out.
No Defaults
As investors scrutinize the stress to the British economy, Rishi Khosla, the CEO of an online lender called OakNorth, drew guffaws of disbelief when he said his firm had never recorded a default or late payment, thanks to its machine learning capabilities. He might be not lending enough, said Olivier Goy, the CEO of October, which originates loans for small businesses, said on a panel the next day.
There was a feeling that European fintech is maturing, though retaining its dynamism. German digital bank N26 GmbH recently garnered a valuation of $2.7 billion. Mastercard and Visa Inc. are battling to buy a London cross-border payments firm called Earthport Plc, and Adyen NV, the Dutch payment processor that went public last year, has minted three billionaires as its stock has nearly tripled.
Looser times are over, said Benedetta Arese Lucini, the founder and CEO of Oval Money Ltd., a startup based in London and Turin that lets consumers manage their spending and saving. Wrapping up her spiel in a pitch contest, she said she was swearing off attending more conferences. And shes done with spending her time taking part in pitch contests, too.
Last year we could screw up, make mistakes, but you cant do that anymore, Arese Lucini said. Our adolescence is over."
234,Senate Democrats call for restricting corporate share buybacks,Sens. Charles Schumer and Bernie Sanders are proposing a law that would put preconditions on companies that want to buy back their shares.,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/04/senate-democrats-call-for-restricting-corporate-share-buy-backs.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-04T14:44:00Z,"Senate Democrats are proposing legislation that would prevent companies from buying back their own shares unless they first pay workers $15 an hour and offer paid time off and health benefits.
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer of New York and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont outlined their plan on Monday in an opinion column submitted to The New York Times. The proposed law would slap ""preconditions"" on a company's ability to buy its own shares. ""The goal is to curtail the overreliance on buybacks while also incentivizing the productive investment of corporate capital,"" they wrote.
Last year, more than $1 trillion in buybacks were announced by large companies after a corporate tax cut pushed through Washington in late 2017 left companies with a lot of extra cash to spend. But instead of significantly raising worker pay or investing in equipment, companies mostly used the cash to buy their stock. And some large companies are buying back billions of dollars of shares while announcing layoffs and closings, the Senators wrote.
For example, Walmart announced a $20 billion share buyback while at the same time laying off hundreds and closing Sams Club stores. The column cites a Roosevelt Institute analysis that the retailer could have used the money instead to raise hourly wages to $15.
Harley Davidson is buying back 15 million shares while closing a plant in Kansas City, Mo., Wells Fargo spent billions of dollars on buybacks while ""openly plotting"" to cut 10 percent of its workforce, the Senators said.
""At a time of huge income and wealth inequality, Americans should be outraged that these profitable corporations are laying off workers while spending billions of dollars to boost their stock's value to further enrich the wealthy few,"" the column said.
It isn't the first time a ban on corporate stock buybacks has been floated. Last year, Wisconsin Democrat Sen. Tammy Baldwin sought to ban stock buybacks as open market purchases, using the same argument that they have contributed to economic inequality and divert resources away from workers.
Last June, more than a dozen lawmakers, including Schumer and Baldwin, wrote to Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton urging him to open public comments on the rules for stock buybacks, which they said hadn't been updated in over a decade. They cited a Brookings Institute study that found from 2004 to 2014, the largest U.S. companies spent 51 percent of profit on buybacks.

India will face challenges meet its federal budget-deficit target next FY after missing this year's, says Moody's. Finance Minister Piyush Goyal didn't announce any new policies to increase revenue in today's budget proposal while a number of spending measures would create deficit pressure. The government now sees this FY's gap equaling 3.4% of GDP, versus a prior earlier forecast of 3.3%, and is expecting 3.4% for the year starting April 1. Moody's views the continued slippage as a credit negative, adding that India's high debt burden remains its biggest credit challenge. It doesn't seen that easing quickly. (debiprasad.nayak@wsj.com)
A manufacturing slowdown will hurt Taiwan more than Korea because Korea has more support from non-manufacturing sectors, including services and construction, says DBS. Both are key Asian manufacturing hubs at risk from slowing demand globally, particularly in China. PMIs in both countries fell below 50 in 4Q with Taiwan's December PMI the lowest since September 2015. There will be ""less room for complacency"" if this continues, says DBS. Taiwan's GDP growth fell below 1% when PMIs contracted for 6 months in 2011 and 7 months in 2012, and the economy contracted for 2 quarters in 2015 after 8 months of sub-50 PMIs, it notes. DBS expects Taiwan's GDP growth to slow to 2.2% this year with South Korea's moderating to 2.6%; both economies are estimated to have expanded 2.7% last year. (kenan.machado@wsj.com)

236,Cramer: Why companies like Alphabet don't get enough credit for their cash piles,Jim Cramer breaks down the market's obsession with how large technology companies like Alphabet and Apple use their cash.,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/05/cramer-why-companies-like-alphabet-dont-get-credit-for-their-cash.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-05T23:24:00Z,"CNBC's Jim Cramer has concluded that running a profitable, growing business in this market is kind of like walking a tightrope, with value investors who want to see cost-cutting on one side and growth investors who want to see spending on the other.
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
What tipped him off? Google parent Alphabet's Monday night conference call, in which the technology giant's management team went over its fourth-quarter earnings report with shareholders and Wall Street analysts.
""Multiple analysts excoriated them ... for spending like a drunken sailor with no end in sight,"" Cramer said Tuesday on ""Mad Money."" ""However, what really threw me was a question tossed out by a very good analyst, Brent Thill from Jefferies.""
Thill, a top tech analyst, asked management what they planned to do with the company's huge cash hoard. He pointed out that it ""has doubled in the last five years to $109 billion"" despite Alphabet's deal activity being much lower than that of its peers.
""Alphabet was circumspect with its answer, but I think Brent's question cuts to the core dilemma of being a big, profitable growth company, because, in a way, all of that cash can be a curse,"" Cramer said.
Because Alphabet's value-driven shareholders want the giant to cut back on its spending, it ends up sitting on a ""huge mountain"" of cash with nowhere to put it, he explained.
""First, you need to understand Alphabet gets little to no credit for its cash hoard because the money's not doing anything for them they collect a little interest, big deal,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""While the company announced a $12.5 billion buyback, that's small change, simply not enough to move the needle for a $790 billion business.""
Worse, anything that Alphabet might consider buying is likely very expensive, especially considering how much Alphabet is already spending on research and development.
But spending the $109 billion could put Alphabet in an even tougher spot, Cramer said, pointing to the carnage that happened in IBM's stock after it acquired cloud computing company Red Hat.
""At first, the market loathed this deal,"" he said. ""Stock got crushed. Didn't help that this happened in the fourth quarter, when everything tech was falling apart. Lately, though, IBM's come roaring back, especially after reporting a better-than-expected quarter a couple of weeks ago. Hey, maybe the Red Hat acquisition was a good idea after all, but the punishment for taking this kind of bold action was so upsetting that billions of dollars were lost instantly.""
Apple has a similar issue, Cramer continued. Growth investors and bold analysts at the likes of J.P. Morgan want to see the iPhone maker make a flashy acquisition in entertainment despite the fact that it already has some ""incredible offerings"" in the space, he said.
As for Amazon, a hint of margin weakness in its most recent earnings report tanked the stock despite other divisions like cloud and advertising, where the e-commerce giant spends a lot of money, being strong, Cramer said.
""So what should these tech titans do with all of their cash? I don't really have any answers here, but I do know that they shouldn't take their cue from the short-term gyrations in their stocks or the analyst critics,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""My advice? You can't please everybody, and in the case of Alphabet and Amazon and Apple, I think it's a mistake to even try.""
Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Alphabet, Apple and Amazon.

237,Amazon sellers get caught in U.S.-China trade spat as money transfer service abruptly closes,"WorldFirst told U.S. customers this week that the money transfer service was closing immediately, and it didn't provide a reason.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/01/worldfirst-abruptly-closes-us-operations-amid-ant-financial-deal-talks.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-01T18:54:00Z,"On Friday, the Financial Times reported that WorldFirst ""abruptly closed"" its U.S. business to avoid having the acquisition ""derailed by American regulators."" The paper cited two people briefed on the decision. WorldFirst's U.S. operation was based in Austin, Texas, and the company also had employees in San Francisco. One person told the FT that the move would result in ""heavy job losses"" among the U.S. staff.
WorldFirst didn't respond to requests for comment.
It's the latest example of the collateral damage that's resulting from the escalating U.S.-China spat, which centers on a trade imbalance as well as alleged intellectual property theft by Chinese firms. The two governments have set a deadline of early March to come to an agreement on a trade deal. In the meantime, the Trump administration has been blocking big deals, such as Chinese companies taking significant stakes in U.S. businesses and from buying certain U.S. technology components, claiming such transactions would pose a national security threat.
WorldFirst is one of the main services used by Amazon sellers to handle transactions across the world so merchants can get paid in many different currencies on a single platform. An Amazon sellers group sent an email to members on Friday suggesting that WorldFirst customers switch to rival service Payoneer, which ""can help if you are selling in the US, UK, Europe, Canada, Japan, China, Australia, and Mexico,"" the message said.
WorldFirst said service for customers outside the U.S. and Canada will be unaffected by the change. Clients in those two countries were told that between Jan. 31 and Feb. 7, they could only make outbound transfers to existing beneficiaries. After Feb. 7, any balances would be returned to the sender, and after Feb. 20, the company would have no live phone or email service.
For Ant, the expected acquisition of WorldFirst supports the company's global push and expansion beyond mobile and online payments service Alipay. Ant CEO Eric Jing told CNBC in November that his company was investing in technology services for banks so that it's not limited to payments.
Ant is viewed as an IPO candidate, but Jing said the company doesn't have a ""timetable for that."" Alibaba agreed exactly a year ago to acquire 33 percent of Ant, and has said it won't have any control over the company. Alipay was spun out of Alibaba in 2011.

‘Everyone has analytics in baseball. Soon it will be the same with law’
Judges, like pro athletes, produce volumes of statistics that are being collected and analysed by enterprising companies in the legal sector as a way of getting an edge in certain cases and disputes. Commercial lawyers can assess their chances of winning as soon as a notice to sue arrives. Barney Thompson, the FT’s legal correspondent, takes his cues from Michael Lewis, who documented the rise of obscure performance stats in Major League Baseball in his book, Moneyball. It’s a fascinating story about the businesses setting the odds and taking chance out of the legal process. The co-founder of one lawtech company says:
“A lot of lawyers think of their case as a special snowflake — that the facts are unique, that nothing like it has ever happened before. And it’s just not true.”
‘We’ve been through a few cycles but this one is crazy’
What is the $700bn “private debt” industry all about? Robin Wigglesworth examines the shadowy underside of finance to find out. The market for bespoke, largely untraded non-bank loans is growing more frenzied — and remains unregulated and opaque. Some of those Robin talks to for his story, part of the FT’s illuminating Debt Machine series on non-conventional banking, see parallels with the pre-crisis subprime mortgage market. Oleg Melentyev of Bank of America Merrill Lynch says: 
“It’s a wild west space, where everyone competes for every deal. The whole thing has exploded in size, and everyone is getting into it.”
‘She was haunted by images she could not un-see’
© Journalist Marie Colvin photographed by Don McCullin at her home in London in 2005
Lindsey Hilsum reflects on the process of trying to understand the life’s work of her friend and fellow war reporter, Marie Colvin — and asks whether by writing her biography she has helped perpetuate the myth of the heroic war correspondent. Colvin, killed in Syria in 2012, was a legend among journalists. A film based on her life, A Private War, hits cinemas this month; Hilsum’s story for the FT’s Life &amp; Arts section is essential reading before you see it:
“Part of me wanted to debunk the myth of the glamorous woman in the war zone. But then I was confronted with the reality of Marie, one week . . . in the mountains of Chechnya in fear for her life, and the next chatting to Warren Beatty at an LA party. I understood that the glamour hid pain, but where did the balance lie?”
‘Leasing is another way of financing a kitchen’

Everyone’s favourite Swedish meatball purveyor is entering the rental market so close to my fellow millennials’ hearts. In addition to selling outright, Ikea plans to lease out its cheap flat-pack furniture. The “circular” system, which the world’s largest furniture retailer plans to pilot this month in Switzerland, allows customers to trade in tables, chairs and perhaps even entire kitchens for fresher models once the rental period is over. Count me in. According to Torbjorn Loof, chief executive of Inter Ikea:
“It’s interesting if you as a consumer say, ‘I can change and adapt and modernise my kitchen if that’s a subscription model.’”
‘We’re preparing women to make their mark on the world’

Workplace hacks are some of my favourite things — I devour them like cake at 4pm on a Thursday when the FT tea trolley comes round. Cognitive scientist Sian Leah Beilock explains why women can be more susceptible to self-doubt as they enter male-dominated arenas (Silicon Valley start-ups, say, or the US House of Representatives) in ever greater numbers, and how they can fight back:
“When women see other women operating on a level playing field, they will be less likely to doubt their own capabilities. They will happily — and rightfully — pursue their interests, including in the areas once dominated by men.”
Quick hits
Other FT stories that have caught my eye this week 
The delayed State of the Union finally happened on Tuesday. My takeaway from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s suffragette-white outfit is that hoop earrings are key to world domination. Either way, the annotations from our US correspondents in the document provide essential context — and fact-checking — for President Donald Trump’s address.
Meanwhile Jeff Bezos, owner of The Washington Post and a target of presidential tweets, has published a long post on the Medium website. He accuses the National Inquirer and its parent company (run by a friend of Trump) of blackmailing him over allegations of an extramarital affair. The Amazon chief announced last month that he and his novelist wife, who together make up the world’s richest couple, were divorcing.
South Asia bureau chief Amy Kazmin reports from a New Delhi “love marriage” between two teachers: the bride from an “upper” caste, the groom from a family of Dalits, a group once known as “untouchable”. Inter-caste weddings are still rare in India, 70 years after ‘untouchability’ was banned.
Rising costs, high debt and questionable value for money: Andrew Jack’s Big Read looks at why some of those running UK universities are worried about what the future holds or indeed whether their institutions can survive. FT readers respond with their own ideas of how to boost the dwindling value of higher education.

div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
In its 2018 annual report, which was published on Tuesday, Alphabet tweaked a line about competitors, removing Microsoft while keeping Amazon and Apple. The deletion suggests that, in the digital assistant market, Google is seeing Amazon Alexa and Apple Siri continue to gain adoption, but not Cortana.
Microsoft introduced Cortana in 2014 and incorporated it into Windows in 2015. Google announced the Google Assistant in 2016 and started making it available in Android phones later that year.
Google Assistant is now available on more than 1 billion devices, a Google spokesman said in an email. In June Microsoft said Cortana had more than 150 million users.
In addition to the Google Home, Google's voice-powered technology is baked into devices from other hardware makers like JBL, and speaker maker Sonos is planning to bring Google Assistant to its products. Microsoft has not introduced a Cortana-enabled speaker of its own, although Samsung subsidiary Harman Kardon has released a speaker with Cortana inside.
Microsoft's head of Cortana, Javier Soltero, left in November. Andrew Shuman, a corporate vice president who has been at Microsoft for more than 25 years, is now in charge of the company's assistant.
Google is aggressively promoting the Google Home, just as Amazon dramatically steps up its ad spending, including for the Echo. Alphabet's sales and marketing costs rose rose about 12 percent to $16.3 billion in 2018, in part because of increased spending for marketing related to Google Assistant, Tuesday's filing said.

div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
The relationship between AMI, owner of the Enquirer, and Trump has been tense ever since the media company agreed last year to cooperate with New York federal prosecutors, according to Jerry George, who spent 28 years at the tabloid, including as senior editor and Los Angeles bureau chief.
The AMI agreement in connection with a hush-money payment given to Karen McDougal, the Playboy model who claims to have had an affair with Trump, caused a ""falling out"" between Pecker and the president, George told CNBC on Friday.
""The Bezos divorce ordinarily wouldn't be registered on the Enquirer 'Richter scale' other than that he is the archenemy of President Trump,"" George said in a ""Squawk on the Street"" interview.""I think American Media and David Pecker tried to make amends and brought this divorce story to the president as a means of kissing and making up.""
George said he left the tabloid is 2013. ""The financial hardships of the company were taking its toll,"" he said. 
AMI has not responded to CNBC's request for comment on George's assertions.
Trump has been a frequent critic of Bezos, the founder of Amazon who also personally owns The Washington Post. The president has used Twitter repeatedly to blast the e-commerce giant for not paying enough taxes and the newspaper of having a negative bias against his administration.
In a bombshell blog post Thursday, Bezos accused the National Enquirer's publisher of threatening to post sexual pictures that the billionaire had texted to his mistress. He accused AMI of blackmail and extortion.
Amazon has not responded to CNBC's requests for comment.
AMI denied Bezos' claims, saying in a statement, ""American Media believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos,"" adding, however, the board determined ""it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims.""
Stu Zakim, a former spokesman for AMI, told CNBCon Friday that he also suspects the Enquirer story was politically motivated. ""There was a falling out, we thought, between Pecker and Trump when all of sudden the National Enquirer stopped covering him as lovingly as they did.""
As for the White House, a press official told CNBC he's not sure if Trump is aware of the situation, adding he's ""not going to get into a conversation about something between Jeff Bezos and a tabloid magazine."""

 working with Netflix — and how we can save the planet",https://www.ft.com/content/01388ede-261b-11e9-b329-c7e6ceb5ffdf,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-08T12:21:51Z,"Sir David Attenborough and Elizabeth II were born within three weeks of each other in 1926. And to many in Britain, Attenborough enjoys almost royal status. Asked in a 2017 poll who should appear on the next £20 note, 40 per cent of Britons chose the presenter — with Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, the runner-up with 7 per cent.
In television series such as Life on Earth and The Blue Planet, Attenborough has guided generations of viewers through the wonders of the natural world. His style is inimitable — his eyes wide in delight, his arms spread, his voice lowering to a whisper as he introduces viewers to some marvel, whether it is gorillas in Rwanda or birds of paradise in New Guinea. The Attenborough fan club is international. On his 89th birthday he was invited to the White House, to be interviewed on camera by President Barack Obama.
Now 92, he is still travelling, working and campaigning. In December, he addressed the UN climate change conference in Poland. In the preceding months, he was filming on the Zambezi river in Africa and visiting Kenya for the World Wide Fund for Nature. We meet during his first trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos — home to the endangered liberal plutocratic elite.
I arrive early and bump into Attenborough, who is accompanied by his daughter Susan, a retired teacher who lives with him in west London. He is a stocky figure in a blue blazer, white shirt and black trousers and seems slightly hassled, without the beaming bonhomie of his on-screen persona. I have the impression that he would prefer to be surrounded by chimpanzees than CEOs.

Attenborough has a packed schedule. So we are meeting for “lunch” at 10.15am in an upstairs room — overlooking the foyer of the Congress Centre — which has been stocked with coffee, plates of sliced fruit and a cakestand of petits fours. As we settle into our chairs, I get off on the wrong foot by asking to take a photo of him. He groans. (I later discover that he loathes having his picture taken.) As we begin talking, I ask what he makes of Davos. “Well it’s not exactly my scene,” he replies cautiously. So why make the trip? “Social conscience,” he replies, slightly gruffly, then laughs.
Five minutes into our conversation, it is clear that this self-deprecating remark does not capture what is actually driving Attenborough. He really is driven by passion. He knows that the natural wonders that he has brought into living rooms all over the world are critically endangered. “We’re heading for big disasters if we go on the way we are. We are changing the climate, we are changing the seas, we are wiping out entire species and ecosystems . . . We only have one or two decades left to fix it.” His mission is to try to persuade world leaders to do something.
I’m convinced that there is a real chance that we may be able to do something to heal the world. If there was one chance in a hundred, you would take it, would you not?
Once he has warmed to his themes, Attenborough’s initial reserve drops away. He talks engagingly, leaning forward in his chair to make points. Despite his age, there is nothing tremulous about his voice. And although he is eminent and old, he does not lecture.
In his latest television series, Dynasties, he followed families of tigers, chimpanzees, painted wolves, penguins and lions. It was full of breathtaking footage but also seemed to have a tragic subtext. The common thread, for all the dynasties, is that human encroachment is threatening their very existence. In one sequence, a lion cub is dying after eating poisoned meat left by farmers.
Attenborough explains that he did not set out to preach. “You do a programme about lions and you say, ‘I’m going to tell you the truth of what happens to them.’ We didn’t want it to happen, of course we didn’t — either from an ecological point of view or from a storytelling point of view. But that is what happened.”
That story was all too typical of what is happening to African lions, whose numbers have fallen more than 40 per cent in the past three generations. There are now only 20,000 left in the wild in Africa. Other species are even more critically endangered. Rhino numbers plummeted two-thirds between 1980 and 2006 and have fallen further since, while the melting of polar ice is endangering polar bears and walruses.
Given these grim statistics, I suggest that it may already be too late. He leans forward for emphasis and says, with some anguish: “I’m convinced that there is a real chance that we may be able to do something to heal the world. If there was one chance in a hundred, you would take it, would you not?”
Talking urgently and sipping from a cup of coffee, he clearly has little interest in the snacks laid out before him. And scoffing patisseries while my guest laments the destruction of the natural world seems inappropriate. So, trying to maintain eye contact, I surreptitiously spear a slice of mango and change the subject to his early life.
The honours and titles that have come Attenborough’s way — added to the fact that his older brother, Richard, who died in 2014, was a highly successful actor and director — have left me with the impression that he must have come from a rather grand family. But he gently corrects that impression. “My father was the son of a small village shop owner in the 19th century in the middle of England. His education was funded by grants and scholarships and he became a fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, studying Anglo-Saxon.”
With a flash of pride, he points out that his father’s book on Anglo-Saxon kings has recently been republished, almost a century after it first appeared. “Anyway, he ended up as principal of University College, Leicester and I can tell you the principal of a suburban university college in the middle of the 20th century wasn’t paid a load of money. He said to me, if you want to go on to further study, you have to get scholarships.” He adds quietly: “And that is what I did.”
While David worked his way through grammar school and then Cambridge university, Richard took a less scholarly route. “He was passionate about the theatre . . . and failed all his exams, which my father found very hard to understand. But he said to Dick, ‘I’ll give you the entrance fee for the toughest drama-school scholarship you can find, which was to Rada, and if you get it — I’ll back you’. And Dick took the exam. And he got it.” His voice rises in fraternal triumph at this decades-old memory.
Lunch is for chimps?
Petits fours, mango slices and a lot of coffee
Like his brother, Attenborough is a natural performer. His joy in the animals he encounters is transmitted easily to viewers and there is now a huge stock of Attenborough moments on YouTube. I mention one sequence that had delighted me, when he sits next to a cheetah that is purring like a domestic cat. “No, no, the purring was me.” He pauses. For a moment, I wonder if he is being serious — before a chuckle tells me he is not. I ask the obvious layman’s question: wasn’t it a bit dangerous? He explains that “by and large, animals, big mammals, they don’t want to attack you. They would much rather have a quiet life . . . you usually know when an animal is relaxed and easy.”
Attenborough discovered his ability to convey his love of nature to a wider public by accident, during compulsory military service just after the second world war. “I was on an air station down in Pembrokeshire [in Wales]. I was an education officer and also a navigation officer. We had a squadron of highly trained Spitfire pilots and all these chaps wanted to do was fly.” He sits back and makes a guttural noise to imitate the sound of a Spitfire in flight. “But the government couldn’t afford to put them in the air. So I was told, ‘all right schoolie, get them interested in something’. And Pembrokeshire was marvellous for natural history. So I started courses on seabirds and fossils and all these gung-ho pilots turned out to be quite keen on it.”
After National Service, Attenborough spent a couple of dull years in educational publishing — “that was a mistake” — and made a failed application to join BBC Radio: “I didn’t even get an interview.” But then he got a letter from the newly formed television service. “I wish I still had it. It said something like, ‘we’ve got this new thing called television in Alexandra Palace. A lot of people are quite rude about it, but we think it might be quite interesting. Would you be interested?’”

The early days of television were full of opportunity: “Within six months, I was producing political discussions, knitting, gardening, short stories . . . Then I discovered that someone from the zoo was going on an expedition to collect animals, and I thought great! — let’s try that.” That led to a programme called Zoo Quest, broadcast in the 1950s, which took him to Borneo, Paraguay and Guyana, in search of animals such as the Komodo dragon or the armadillo.
The result led to the birth of the natural history programme, in which the BBC and Attenborough have led the world. What has he learnt, over the decades, about how to make natural history programmes?
He chuckles and takes on a mock-conspiratorial tone: “Just between you and me, making television programmes about animals is not very difficult. You just have to point the camera in the right direction and make sure the lens cap is off.” Of course, he concedes, “the quality of those films we made in the 1950s now looks terrible. But nobody in Britain had ever seen an armadillo or a pangolin. Nobody! Honestly, all you had to be was marginally competent.”
This kind of self-deprecation is charming and old school but I do not get the impression that it is insincere. At various points he describes himself as “half-educated” (“I took a wartime degree at Cambridge, it was just two years.”) and just a programme maker, “not a scientist, not an economist”.
The popularity of his programmes means that Attenborough has a unique ability to shape public opinion. Some environmentalists have accused him of being too reluctant to use that platform — and of concentrating on the wonders of the natural world, without stressing how endangered they are. But he argues that, with more than 50 per cent of the world’s population living in cities, most people have little connection with nature. They have to be shown the natural world before they can be persuaded to care about it. And for 20 years, his programmes have typically ended with an urgent environmental message.
The one hope we have is the empowerment of women . . . When that happens, birth rates drop. It’s not the solution to everything. But it’s a start
Sometimes the impact can be extraordinary. Blue Planet II showed how plastic is polluting the oceans, with albatrosses choking on bags and a chick dying after ingesting a toothpick. It provoked an almost instant reaction in Britain — with politicians promising new laws and supermarkets changing their packaging. “It’s very strange and it’s quite unpredictable,” he muses. “You strike the chord and the vibrations spread. Those of us who made Blue Planet II got all the credit, but we’re not the pioneers on this. There are campaigners who have dedicated their lives to this issue.”
The fact that his next series, Our Planet, will be shown on Netflix is something of a blow to the BBC, where Attenborough made his career and where he was a senior executive in the 1960s. As controller of BBC2 he commissioned some of the corporation’s most famous programmes — including Monty Python’s Flying Circus and Kenneth Clark’s Civilisation. But Attenborough will still make programmes for the BBC, and is clearly enthused by the ability of Netflix to reach a whole new global audience: “It’s over 200m people, it’s urgent, it’s instantaneous. And it stays there for months, so it can get an even bigger audience through word of mouth.”
The reach of Netflix may help Attenborough engineer another of those shifts in public opinion. But he knows there will also be setbacks. “Trump is a setback,” he notes. “The new president of Brazil is a setback.” The aforesaid president, Jair Bolsonaro, wants to chop down even more of the Amazon.
Is he surprised by how short-sighted people can be about the environment? He is reluctant to condemn: “I’ve only got to think back 50 or 60 years ago, when I was short-sighted . . . It didn’t occur to us that mankind might exterminate whole species and whole ecosystems and indeed at that stage, we were not doing so. But since that time the population of the world has tripled.” His voice rises in incredulity.
The population explosion in Africa — where it is likely to double to 2.4bn by 2050, according to the UN — poses a clear threat to the continent’s wildlife. “The one hope we have is the empowerment of women,” he says. “When that happens, birth rates drop. It’s not the solution to everything. But it’s a start.”
He was once a fan of China’s one-child system, but he acknowledges it ultimately had to be changed. I wonder if he thinks that authoritarian governments might be better placed to take long-term decisions to protect the environment. He nods in agreement. “Absolutely so, you can take really draconian decisions. It’s a double-edged sword, but they have the authority and mechanisms.”
His food is untouched. Now he has to head off to engage the rich and powerful. Warm words do not necessarily translate into radical action, and Attenborough knows that this task requires an appeal to self-interest. He believes that his invitation to Davos demonstrates that global leaders are increasingly understanding that “the whole of our civilisation is dependent on the health of the natural world”.
But for him, this is clearly about something more than self-interest. “We aren’t the only creatures that live on this planet,” he says. “We don’t have the right to exterminate other animal species.” Then he heads out into the melee.

Thrusters work constantly to keep the boats centre within a three-metre radius above a well head on the seabed almost 2km below. Workers fly in and out by helicopter. Some come from Guyana, some America, their rubber-soled boots adorned with cowboy stitching. Once aboard they manage towering drill pipes, guide robots near the ocean floor, monitor storms or perhaps just cook. All these efforts are directed towards a single goal: drilling as effectively as possible, so the ship can move to the next oil well and then the next.

Companies had spent decades looking for oil off the coast of Guyana. In 2015 ExxonMobil, the worlds largest publicly traded oil company, became the first to find it. The firm now estimates that more than 5bn barrels of oil lie beneath the seabed. If all goes to plan, within the next decade Guyana could become the second-biggest oil producer in Latin America, behind only Brazil. That would transform a poor and tiny country into a petrostate. For ExxonMobil, the project is part of a bid to reassert its dominance. On February 1st the company announced annual results, declaring itself on track for ambitious growth. By 2025, oil and gas production will be 25% higher than in 2017.
ExxonMobil was once the worlds most valuable company and is still a giant of the industry. It has survived for 137 years, emerging from the break-up of Standard Oil in 1911 to become the energy firm that inspired both the greatest respect and the greatest contempt. Exxon built a sprawling global empire of oil reserves, refineries and petrochemical plants, cementing its place as a leviathan after its merger with Mobil in 1999. The company was notorious for giving little information to investors, judging that impressive cash flows and returns on capital spoke for themselves.
ExxonMobil has given ample fuel to the industrys detractors, too. The greatest failure came in 1989, when a tanker, the Exxon Valdez, ran aground, pouring 11m gallons of crude onto unspoilt Alaskan shorelines. But events that attracted criticism also made it seem impregnable. It has weathered lawsuits over everything from a leaky petrol station to abetting torture in Indonesia. According to Private Empire, Steve Colls book of 2012 on ExxonMobil, Lee Raymond, the firms boss between 1993 and 2005, admired Standard Oil for sticking to its position, even when it was controversial. To that end Mr Raymond argued vociferously against the Kyoto Protocol, an international deal to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions signed in 1997. America withdrew from the agreement in 2001.
Two decades after the merger with Mobil, the company culture remains rigorous and private. Its headquarters in Irving, Texas, are tucked away on a site occasionally traversed by bobcats. Tech firms may offer complimentary quinoa but ExxonMobil staff are clear-eyed about free lunch. Avocados at the salad bar cost 55 cents extra.
In recent years, however, disappointing results and missteps mean that ExxonMobil no longer looks invincible. Tech giants are now more valuable. Under the leadership of Rex Tillerson, who left the company in 2017 to become Donald Trumps secretary of state, ExxonMobil paid $31bn in 2009 for XTO Energy, a shale-gas firm, just before gas prices crashed. In 2017 the company was forced to write down 4.8bn barrels of reserves, nearly a fifth of the companys total, because low oil prices had made extraction uneconomic. The firms return on capital employed, an impressive 49% in 2008, had crumpled to 9% by 2017 (see chart 1).
ExxonMobil, along with other big oil companies, now faces existential risks, too. Calls are rising to reduce carbon emissions and limit the rise in global temperatures. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), doing so becomes more difficult after 2030, as it would depend more heavily on draconian rules and big leaps in science. This has increased pressure to hasten a transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources of power. The regulation of emissions, lawsuits and advances in clean-energy technology that this entails could force oil demand to fall and the price to plunge.
Against this backdrop Darren Woods, who replaced Mr Tillerson in 2017, has a strategy to ensure success for years to comesticking to what ExxonMobil does best. His intention, announced last year, is to spend more than $200bn over seven years. This will include big investments in petrochemicals and refining. But his boldest plan is for boosting the output of fossil fuels. Mr Woods wants the companys profits from oil and gas to reach about $23bn in 2025, triple what they were in 2017.
We take a long-term view of the industry, Mr Woods explained recently. We are providing the energy needed by economies and by peoples standards of living. Mr Woods says he supports the goals of the Paris climate agreement of 2015, when governments vowed to keep the rise in temperatures well below 2ºC relative to pre-industrial levels. To limit warming to 2ºC, let alone the 1.5ºC that the IPCC recommends, oil production should decline. However ExxonMobil does not expect this to happen (see chart 2). Its forecast of future oil demand, propelled by a growing population and rising incomes, makes rising temperatures seem all but inevitable, contends Kathy Mulvey of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a pressure group. ExxonMobil, backed by 137 years of expertise, is working to supply more fossil fuels.
Activists are pressing oil companies to change. Many oil companies, including ExxonMobil, cut capital spending after the price of crude sank in 2014 (see chart 3 ). Some green advocates began to murmur that big oil firms might change for good if they continued to cut investment and return cash to shareholders or if they pursued modest growth in oil production while pouring money into renewables. Royal Dutch Shell and Total, for example, invested in wind and solar energy, as well as electricity utilities.
ExxonMobils view of climate change has progressed since Mr Raymonds day. We recognise, the industry recognises, broader society has grown to recognise the impact of combustions of oil and gas and the emissions that come with that and the threat that representsthe risk that represents to the climate, Mr Woods explains. He insists that his firm looks very closely at the renewables space and the opportunities to participate in that. The company is applying its geological expertise to research into carbon capture and storage.
Spending on green technologies remains minimal, however. European peers may be investing in utilities, but ExxonMobil has little appetite for them. We have much higher expectations for the returns on the capital we invest, Mr Woods asserts. ExxonMobil plans instead to expand its usual business. On December 3rd Shell, under pressure from green investors, said that it would tie executive pay to a plan to cut carbon emissions from its products even as ExxonMobil announced yet another oil discovery off Guyana, its tenth.
Some of the firms plans resemble those of its peers. It is investing in petrochemicals and in American shale-oil, where production can rise and fall far more quickly than in big offshore projects, making it suited for an era of uncertainty. Like other oil giants, ExxonMobil highlights its investments in gas, which produces electricity more cleanly than coal. But it is unusual in its appetite for higher spendingit expects an increase of 16% this yearand in its bullish views about both gas and oil.
Reserves are continuously drained, Mr Woods points out, so the industry must invest to sustain production. There is a tremendous amount of growth required in a depletion business just to stand still. However ExxonMobil is investing not only to maintain production but also to increase it as projects in America, Guyana and Brazil begin pumping crude.
Investors greeted Mr Woodss plan with dismay. Other oil companies were announcing buy-backs, not big investments. The company, newly solicitous, has tried to be more transparent. On February 1st Mr Woods took the unusual measure for a boss of ExxonMobil of answering investors questions on the annual earnings call. He reported increased production and plans for even higher capital expenditures in 2019. After a bumpy 12 months, the companys share price ticked up.
Environmentalists and green investors, long critics of ExxonMobil, are trying to knock the company off course. Several American cities and counties are using the courts to demand that large oil companies pay for the cost of guarding against rising sea levels. In October New Yorks attorney-general filed a suit alleging that ExxonMobil used one set of assumptions about climate change in external documents and another for internal planning. That case is pending. In January Americas Supreme Court rejected the firms attempt to halt a separate investigation by Massachusetts over whether it misled the public about threats from climate change.
Lawsuits are unlikely to vanquish ExxonMobil. Last year a federal judge in California dismissed a lawsuit against oil firms, arguing that Congress and diplomacy, not courts, should handle the fallout from climate change. If I were trying to think of an existential threat to the company its not litigation, says Andrew Logan of Ceres, a non-profit that works with investors to argue for sustainability, its whether the business strategy is obsolete.
ExxonMobils biggest risk appears to be a world where oil demand peaks as measures to combat emissions grow, and then prices fall. Projects might become uneconomic sooner than expected, stranding the companys assets. Mr Woods says he is backing projects with low costs. He argues that his firms unusually high level of integration of its various businesses and technology means it can produce more efficiently than its peers. Take oil extracted in the Permian basin of Texas. ExxonMobil uses data analysis to drill for oil using extra-long wells, then transports it to company refineries and petrochemical plants nearby.
Concern is growing among investors, however. In 2017, 62% of ExxonMobils shareholders voted to require the company to disclose how action to limit temperature rises to 2ºC would affect its business. ExxonMobil produced a document that critics charged was too vague. This year shareholders will vote on a new resolution, filed by the pension funds for New York state and the Church of England, to require ExxonMobil to do what Shell has done and commit to reducing emissions not just from its operations but also from the products it sells.
Even if shareholders vote in favour of the resolution, ExxonMobil, like Shell, would probably have an escape hatch. Shell can increase production of oil and gas under its new targets, as long as it takes other steps such as increasing energy production from wind and solar. Shell also may adjust its targets, to keep its plans consistent with societys progress towards the goals of the Paris treaty. If governments do not restrict carbon emissions, Shell can ease up too.
ExxonMobil might have to change its strategy more dramatically if more investors turn away from oil and gas. But that looks unlikely at the moment. Gas faces growing competition from wind and solar but for now it can help replace coal plants. Oil still has a stranglehold on transport. In an optimistic scenario only 15% of the worlds cars will be electric by 2030. Lorries and planes will be electrified more slowly still.
Thomas DiNapoli, who oversees New Yorks pension fund, has played a central role in putting pressure on ExxonMobil. However he says his fund will not divest soon, in part because oil companies are held by big indices that generate good returns. He is not alone. Far from abandoning them, the shareholdings of the worlds 20 largest institutional investors in big oil companies climbed from 24% in 2014 to 27% in 2017, according to the International Energy Agency.
Politicians may have more sway. E3G, a think-tank, simulated the interaction of different policies and corporate strategies. If the world were to move on to a pathway compatible with warming below 2ºC, the price of oil would drop and a company with ExxonMobils strategywhat E3G calls last one standingmight come into direct competition with large national oil companies with very low production costs, such as Saudi Aramco.
To date politicians, particularly in America, have been reluctant to legislate for bold restrictions on carbon. That is in part thanks to ExxonMobils attempts to obstruct efforts to mitigate climate change. Mr Raymond worked to sow doubt about climate science. Mr Tillerson adopted a more convoluted position. In 2009 he announced the companys support for a carbon tax, which was not under serious consideration in America, and argued against a cap-and-trade scheme for pollution permits, which was. Mr Tillerson supported the Paris climate agreement but also said that there was no scientific basis for limiting warming to 2ºC and warned that the world depended on fossil fuels for our very survival.
Under Mr Woods ExxonMobils policies on climate change remain marred by inconsistencies. In October the company said it was giving $1m, spread over two years, to a group advocating a carbon tax. ExxonMobil maintains that a carbon tax is a transparent and fair way to limit emissions. But the sum is less than a tenth of its federal lobbying spending in 2018. Moreover, the carbon tax it favours would include protection for oil companies from climate lawsuits.
These boots are made for drilling
The firm is also working to reduce leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, from its wells, pipelines and refineries. However the American Petroleum Institute (API), of which Mr Woods is chairman, has been a main force urging Mr Trumps administration to ease regulations on methane emissions. The APIs other efforts include lobbying against incentives for electric cars.
As other oil and gas companies grapple with their own strategies, ExxonMobil may not prove an outlier in committing to business as usual. Even firms investing more in renewables are loth to give up fossil fuels, which are far more profitable. Total, BP and Chevron plan to increase production of oil and gas. Analysts at RBC, a bank, expect Shell to do so, too.
ExxonMobil is not alone in trying to sway the climate debate in its direction either. Shell, Total and BP are all members of the API. Marathon Petroleum, a refiner, reportedly campaigned to ease Barack Obamas fuel-economy standards. BP spent $13m to help block a proposal for a carbon tax in Washington state in November. The Western States Petroleum Association, whose membership includes ExxonMobil and Shell, also lobbied to defeat that tax.
While oil companies plan to grow, trends in cleaner energy are moving in the wrong direction. Investments in renewables fell as a share of the total in 2017 for the first time in three years, as spending on oil and gas climbed. In 2018 carbon emissions in America grew by 3.4% as economic activity picked up, even as coal fell out of favour. Mr Woods maintains that any change to the energy supply will be gradual. I dont think people can readily understand just how large the energy system is, and the size of that energy system will take time to evolve, he argues.
ExxonMobil meanwhile continues to search for oil, reshaping the world as it goes. In Guyana there is much debate over how to use the royalties from oil. Possibilities include programmes for the poor and infrastructure to deal with flooding. Guyanas capital, Georgetown, rests below sea level. Water often laps city streets.
Out at sea, ExxonMobil is working to increase production. By next year an underwater web of pipes will connect wells on the seabed to a vast vessel. From there the oil will be transferred to smaller tankers, then to the vast infrastructure that can refine and transport it until it reaches consumers in the form of fertiliser, plastic bottles, polyester or, most likely, petrol. From beneath the ocean floor to your cars tank, for about the price of a gallon of milk.

243,Some of Alphabet's 'Other Bets' have their own equity structures — just like real start-ups,Alphabet's long-term bets are risky and may never pay off. Employees need to put in the kind of hours associated with start-ups and be able to share in the upside.,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/05/alphabet-other-bets-equity-structure-explained.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-05T18:15:00Z,"Google's 2015 restructuring into a holding company called Alphabet was a bit puzzling at the time.
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
Essentially, the company took its very well-established and well-regarded business, which accounts for 99 percent of its revenue and more than 100 percent of its profit, and put it under a holding company alongside a bunch of tiny experimental companies, like self-driving cars (Waymo), health-tech projects (Verily) and venture capital investments (GV, formerly Google Ventures, for early-stage bets; and CapitalG for later-stage investments).
At the time, CEO Larry Page wrote the restructuring ""allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren't very related."" He noted that each of the independent companies would have its own CEO, while Page would remain in charge of the overall holding company.
In practice, this also allowed Page to appoint a new Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, to manage everything associated with Google, including uncomfortable tasks like speaking on earnings calls and testifying before Congress, so Page could spend time on the areas that interest him most.
The split also reassured investors that, despite all the noise the company made about these long-term bets, it wasn't blowing a lot of money on them. In the fourth quarter, for example, these ""Other Bets"" lost $1.3 billion on revenue of $154 million, while Google proper earned $9.7 billion in operating income on $39.1 billion in sales. The side projects made for a sizeable but affordable investment.
But there's a more subtle reason that started to become clear on Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call on Monday. The company is apparently treating some of these companies like true start-ups all the way down to issuing equity in them that's not strictly tied to the value of publicly traded Alphabet shares.
On the call, Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat noted:
In 2018 we also saw continued progress on our goal to nurture new businesses outside of Google, our Other Bets, with the model of independence.
While I've said previously that there is no monolithic approach to how the Other Bets execute against opportunities, our shared principle is aligning employee interest with the long-term value creation by these companies.
Since inception this has been an important part of our approach of Google with stock grants comprising a meaningful components of overall compensation across our employee base. We're increasingly following that approach in the Other Bets with compensation programs that align employee and company interest.
You've seen the impact of some of those programs in the fourth quarter as we accrued compensation expenses to reflect increases in the valuation of equity in certain Other Bets. While these expenses will recur the timing of valuation events is unpredictable and can vary between bets, which can affect quarterly comparisons.
During Q&amp;A, Porat reiterated the point:
In certain Other Bets, employees are compensated through equity-based programs, and that's because we believe that this alignment of interest is valuable.
In other words, Alphabet knows these long-term bets are risky and may never pay off. To succeed, the employees who work for them need to put in the kind of hours normally associated with start-ups. And to convince employees to do that, they have to be able to share in the upside if the value of these companies increases 100 times otherwise, why not just go down the street and work for the hot start-up of the hour, where there's a real chance to become spectacularly wealthy?
The revelation that some of Alphabet's Other Bets have their own equity structure leads to some interesting questions:
Who determines the valuation of each Other Bet, and what methods do they use?
Can equity in these companies be traded among private investors, or are there restrictions that allow Alphabet to retain control?
Do the shares in the Other Bets come with voting rights, or does Alphabet retain complete control?
Could Alphabet try to spin these Other Bet companies off into separate public traded entities with their own shares, and how would existing Alphabet shareholders who nominally own a piece of them today be compensated?
If you're an investor today and you think Google's best days are behind it but think there's long-term potential in self-driving cars, is there any method for you to invest your money in Waymo without buying Alphabet shares? It appears that Alphabet is selling equity in at least some of these companies to private investors Silver Lake just led a $1 billion investment in Verily late last year. Is there a path for smaller investors to get involved?
We've put these questions to Alphabet's investor relations team, and we'll update this article if we hear back.
The whole arrangement highlights the quandary that any successful tech company faces. Everybody in the industry has read Clayton Christensen and is cognizant of the cycle of disruption the mainframe was disrupted by the PC, which was in turn disrupted by the smartphone and how companies that are on top of the world one day can shrink into oblivion in a few short years (see Nokia and BlackBerry).
The only way out of this trap is to be your own biggest disruptor. But it's extremely difficult a company has to be willing to forego the profitable businesses that made it successful before they're finished delivering cash and profits.
Today's tech giants are handling this in different ways. At Amazon, CEO Jeff Bezos has tried to instill cultural values like ""always Day One,"" that keep employees thinking like they work for a start-up. Microsoft has over the last decade completely shifted the company's focus away from Windows on desktop PCs and toward cloud computing.
At Alphabet, the solution seems to be to take the company's massive resources and apply them in a venture capital-style model to a bunch of promising start-ups. The experiment is less than four years old, so it's impossible to say whether it will succeed or not. But the methods are gaining clarity.

244,Netflix’s Newest Breakout Star? Ted Bundy,"After the success of ""The Ted Bundy Tapes,"" Netflix paid out $9 million to acquire a biopic of the serial killer starring Zac Efron.",http://fortune.com/2019/02/04/netflix-ted-bundy-tapes-zac-efron-movie/,"{'id': 'fortune', 'name': 'Fortune'}",2019-02-04T23:28:45Z,"Netflix is back in the Ted Bundy business.
Just days after premiering its hit documentary series Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes, the streaming giant reportedly won a heated, multi-studio war to acquire Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Vile and Evil, a biopic starring Zac Efron as Bundy, the famed serial killer. Netflix paid $9 million for the controversial drama, which was directed by Academy Award-nominated filmmaker Joe Berlinger, and premiered last week as part of the annual Sundance Film Festival.
The move comes shortly after the premiere of Conversations with a Killer, Netflix’s four-part Bundy mini-series, which brings the mass-murderer to life via archival interviews with Bundy while he was in prison. One of the company’s overseas Netflix accounts teased Conversations’ release with a wry warning: “Maybe don’t watch it alone.” And while the company doesn’t release viewership information, the serieswhich was also directed by Berlingerwent on to become a social-media hit upon its release late last month.
Bundy, a former law student, was executed in 1989, following a seventies killing-spree that took him across the United States, including stints in the Pacific Northwest and Florida. By the time of his death at the age of 42, he was believed to be responsible for the murders of at least 30 young women; decades later, the exact number of victims remains unknown. Bundy’s been the subject of numerous books and films, including 1986’s The Deliberate Stranger, starring Mark Harmon, and a low-budget 2002 biopic.
But the two Netflix projects will likely give Bundy a surprisingly high pop-culture profileperhaps the biggest since his death. Extremely Wicked received mixedreviews, but many critics have praised the performance by Efron, the 31-year-old former High School Musical star, who in recent years has crossed over to more adult-aimed films such as Neighbors and The Paperboy. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Netflixwhich has numerous films in this year’s Oscar race–will likely mount an awards-season campaign for the actor, who’s never been nominated.
Extremely Wicked was the latest big-figure deal to emerge from Sundance, which has been dominated by streaming services that are increasingly out-spending the major studios. Amazon made two of the biggest payouts of the entire festival, doling out $13 million for Late Night, a Mindy Kaling-written comedy about a talk-show host, and $14 million for another comedy, the self-improvement tale Brittany Runs a Marathon. Netflix, meanwhile, made lower-cost (but still high-profile) acquisitions of several buzz-building documentaries, including American Factoryabout cultures clashing at a Dayton, Ohio workplaceand Knock Down the House, which follows a quartet of female political hopefuls, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Yet the Extremely Wicked deal is among the most notable of the festival. It demonstrates many of the reasons Netflix has gained so much Hollywood momentum in recent years: Its eagerness to capitalize on chatter-worthy subjects (no matter how notorious or controversial, like Bundy); its clear desire to beat the major studios at the awards game; and a seemingly bottomless pocketbook.
Just a few years ago, it seemed as though massive Sundance paydays like the one received for Extremely Wicked were falling out of favor: In the late nineties, the indie-event was overcrowded with hit-seekers, who shelled out millions for barely remembered titles like Happy, Texas and Care of the Spitfire Grill. The market eventually reboundedonly to again be hit by a series of bad deals, like the record-breaking $17.5 million spent on 2016’s The Birth of a Nation, which sank upon release, thanks to controversy about its writer-director Nate Parker.
This year, though, companies like Netflix have once again made Sundance a hot destinationeven if only for the big-spending streamers. Because Netflix keeps so much of its viewership a secret, it will be impossible to know if the $9 million it spent on Extremely Wicked will be worth the risk. But for now, bagging the movie gives the company it enjoys almost as much as trophies: Bragging rights."
245,"Cyber Saturday—Investigating Jeff Bezos’ Sexts, Huawei FBI Sting, Facebook’s Outspoken ex-Security Chief","Investigating how Jeff Bezos' sexts leaked to the National Enquirer. Plus, a Huawei FBI sting and a profile of an ex-Facebook exec.",http://fortune.com/2019/02/09/jeff-bezos-sext-scandal-huawei-sting-fbi-facebook-security-chief/,"{'id': 'fortune', 'name': 'Fortune'}",2019-02-09T22:07:20Z,"How did the National Enquirer obtain the richest man in the world’s sexts?
While the truth remains a closely guarded secret, plenty of theories have been floated. Gavin de Becker, the sagacious security consultant granted carte blanche to investigate the situation by Jeff Bezos, the ultra-billionaire founder of Amazon, alleged adulterer, and target of the Enquirer’s prurient exposé, supposedly believes his boss was not hacked. That’s what Manuel Roig-Franzia, a feature writer with the Washington Post, a publication Bezos owns, says de Becker told him anyway, adding that de Becker believes the leak may have been “politically motivated.” In a recent interview on MSNBC, Roig-Franzia added that de Becker, with whom Roig-Franzia says he has chatted extensively about Bezos’ predicament, is entertaining the possibility “that a government entity might have gotten hold” of Bezos’ text messages and then, somehow, these texts found their way into said tabloid.
Considering for a moment that this might be true, which regime might have done so? Michael Sanchez, an avid Trump supporter and brother of Lauren Sanchez, Bezos’ mistress, has apparently discussed with de Becker the possibility that the president, an avowed Bezos opponent, enlisted allied intelligence services, such as those run by the UK and Israel, to dig up the dirt. It’s a fantastical scenario that stretches the imagination beyond all elasticity. Bezos, on the other hand, seemed to intimate in an essay on the blogging site Medium that the intrusion could have involved another state actor. Specifically, Bezos dwelled on connections between American Media Inc., the Enquirer’s parent, and Saudi Arabia. (The recent murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents, and the kingdom’s reported penchant for mobile spyware, lend plausibility.)
To be clear: I have no privileged information about the entity behind this whodunnit caper; I will note, however, a worthwhile contribution toward the howdunnit. In all the speculation, a blog post by Rob Graham, CEO of Errata Security, a hacking shop, stood out. Using a cheap, online “people finder” service, he was able to discover possible contact information for Bezos’ ladylove, including email addresses, phone numbers, and the names of close relatives. Entering Sanchez’s email addresses into a database of compromised login credentialsthe recent mega-leak dubbed “Collection #1”turned up associated passwords. If Sanchez reused compromised passwords to secure Bezos’ love notes, this might explain the dallying duo’s undoing. If that’s true, then the methods behind this intrusion might not have involved super-sophisticated spy-craft so much as teenage hacker hi-jinx.
Again, I have no idea how these leaks were procured, or who did it, but Graham’s findings suggest at least one possible, simple explanation. If the security of both parties to a conversation is not up to snuff, everyone suffers. “If you send sexy messages and you are a celebrity, there are large parts of the hacker underground who specialize in trying to steal them,” Graham notesa statement that is not an endorsement, but a reality. Through password reuse and phishing attacks, “getting celebrity nude pics is fairly simple.” He adds: “there is no reason to consider conspiracy theories at this time.”
People interested in protecting their own privacy might consider the following advice: Segment your information by using multiple email accounts dissociated from your real-life identity. Secure your digital accounts with strong and unique passwordsand use a tool like HaveIBeenPwned to make sure none of these has been compromised. Adopt two-factor authentication as an added layer of protection. And finally, instruct confidantes in the merits and methods of proper digital security. (Heck, you might even recommend they sign up for this newsletter.)
If a nation state goes after you, it’s likely game over. But there are steps you can take to make it harder for run-of-the-mill hackers to get their hands on your goodies.

The complaint, filed Thursday, could force the location to temporarily cease selling tobacco products.
While only the Miami storefront was issued the complaint, the FDA says the Walgreens pharmacy chain as a whole violates tobacco regulations more than any other pharmacy, with 22% of inspected stores having illegally sold tobacco products to minors.
The violations have led to more than 1,550 warning letters and 240 civil money penalty actions against Walgreens stores nationwide.
“I will be writing the corporate management of Walgreens and requesting a meeting with them to discuss whether there is a corporate-wide issue related to their stores’ non-compliance,” said FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., in a statement.
Gottlieb said the FDA is “considering additional enforcement avenues” to address Walgreens’ violations, adding that he’s “deeply disturbed” a single pharmacy chain was able to rack up nearly 1,800 citations for selling tobacco products to minors.
“We all share the important responsibility of keeping harmful and addictive tobacco products out of the hands of kids. Retailers in particularespecially those who position themselves as health-and-wellness-minded businessesare on the front lines of these efforts and must take that legal obligation seriously,” said Gottlieb.
Walgreens said it’s taken steps towards eliminating violations, including asking store clerks to ask for identification for any customer looking to buy tobacco products and implementing harsher disciplinary action for employees who don’t comply.
“We recognize the seriousness of this issue and welcome the opportunity to meet with the FDA Administrator to discuss all of the steps we are taking, a Walgreens spokesman told Bloomberg.
Preliminary results of the 2018 National Youth Tobacco Survey state that current e-cigarette use increased by 78% among high school students between 2017 and 2018, with an estimated 4.9 million middle and high school students having used a tobacco product within the past 30 days.
Through its Youth Tobacco Prevention Plan, the FDA has aimed to decrease these numbers with restrictions like its ban on flavored e-cigarettes in November.
“Because tobacco use is almost always initiated and established during adolescence, early interventionincluding making sure tobacco products aren’t being sold to kidsis critical,” said the FDA in a statement.
Gottlieb said the FDA is also evaluating data on other large, national retail chains."
247,Cramer: What Wall Street doesn't get about the SunTrust-BB&T merger,Jim Cramer says the tie-up has more to do with technology than any traditional success metric for big banks.,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/08/cramer-what-wall-street-doesnt-get-about-the-suntrust-bbt-merger.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-08T23:59:00Z,"The biggest banking deal since the financial crisis has more to do with technology than any traditional bank metric, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday of BB&amp;T's pivotal $66 billion commitment to buy rival SunTrust Banks.
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
""To me, this BB&amp;T merger of equals with SunTrust is about keeping up with the Joneses in this case, keeping up with the Wells Fargos, the J.P. Morgans and especially the Bank of Americas,"" he told investors. ""These financial titans can spend fortunes to build out terrific cloud-based customer relations platforms that have done a phenomenal job of adding new clients. On their own, neither SunTrust nor BB&amp;T can really compete with the big boys when it comes to technology.""
But the analysts covering BB&amp;T don't seem to understand that, the ""Mad Money"" host said after listening to management's conference call about the deal.
On the call, they mostly asked about ""the old nuts and bolts of banking"" topics like capital ratios, regulation, loan growth, the two banks' cultural fit rather than focusing on what's next in banking technology, he said.
""I think technology specifically, the need for customer relations management software is a crucial part of what drove this deal,"" Cramer argued, pointing to what he saw as Bank of America's lead in the digital banking arena.
In its most recent quarter, Bank of America reported 36 million active digital banking users, versus 31 million three years ago. The bank also said that 77 percent of its consumer deposits were digital, up from 67 percent three years ago.
""Right now, Bank of America is the king of mobile. They have an incredible app, and they have Salesforce to help them figure out what their customers want and when they want it, and they integrate it together,"" Cramer explained. ""That's why Bank of America has such strong account openings [and] such big deposit growth, because people want to bank on the app, not [at] the brick-and-mortar branches these have become expenses, not investments.""
And the people opening accounts at Bank of America aren't just tech-savvy millennials, Cramer said; they're people transferring from other banks, which the ""Mad Money"" host called ""the best kind"" of customer acquisition.
""I think this SunTrust-BB&amp;T deal may be more about playing digital defense than offense,"" he said. ""It's about giving the combined company the scale to invest more heavily in technology, and less in brick-and-mortar, in order to keep those clients happy in a digital world and get some new clients keep them from migrating to Bank of America.""
The problem? Wall Street is choosing to focus on traditional success metrics and turn a blind eye to the power of companies like Salesforce when it comes to cutting costs by upgrading tech, Cramer said.
""My conclusion? If you want to understand the future of the banking business, you need to understand the technology that's transforming the industry. Otherwise you'll miss what's really going on,"" he said. ""These analysts, they don't get the digital imperative, and that's the force behind, I think, what's happening with this transaction.""
BB&amp;T's stock tradedloweron Friday, sinking 0.44 percent to $50.24 a share by day's end. SunTrust's stock also shed roughly 0.54 percent, closing at $64.37 a share. Their all-stock deal, which will create the country's sixth-largest bank, is expected to close later this year and will likely undergo a series of regulatory hurdles for federal approval."
248,Here are the 5 biggest beneficiaries of the 5G rollout: Jim Cramer,"Jim Cramer says Skyworks Solutions, Intel, Qualcomm, Broadcom and Xilinx stand to gain from the ongoing rollout of the fifth generation of wireless communications.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/06/cramer-here-are-the-5-biggest-beneficiaries-of-the-5g-rollout.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-06T23:36:00Z,"Five semiconductor companies are in a prime position to benefit from the rollout of 5G, the fifth generation of wireless communication that telecom companies are racing to implement, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Wednesday.
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
""If you're a semiconductor company with 5G exposure, this is your moment,"" he said after Skyworks Solutions, an Apple supplier that fits that description, surged over 12 percent intraday after delivering its quarterly earnings results.
Skyworks' surge was so strong that it lifted shares of other chipmakers involved in 5G, including Intel, Qualcomm, Broadcom, and Xilinx, all of which stand to benefit from the rise of 5G, Cramer said on ""Mad Money.""
And while he preferred the stock of Skyworks to its peers because of its low price tag and the company's focus on 5G, he said investors ""can make the case for all five.""
Still, Cramer began with his case for Skyworks. While he didn't find its earnings results very impressive, he liked that the company finally managed to change the narrative around its 5G prospects. The CEO repeatedly cited ""the shift to 5G"" as a ""tremendous catalyst"" thanks to all the new connected devices that will need Skyworks' chips.
""No wonder Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock today, predicting that the business will bottom in the first quarter and arguing that the risk-reward here is too attractive to ignore. That's a gutsy call. Makes sense to me,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Even after today's run, get this: Skyworks sells for less than 12 times next year's earnings [estimates], and I think there could be a long runway here.""
People might think of Intel as a personal computer business, but the company's multi-year diversification efforts have made it a player in areas like autonomous driving, the internet of things and communications, Cramer said, citing his recent interview with now-permanent CEO Bob Swan in which he spoke about Intel's 5G opportunity.
""Now, Intel's had some real execution issues of late their latest results and guidance were unambiguously bad, although the stock has now rebounded back to where it was trading before the quarter because investors figured the industry is about to bottom,"" Cramer explained. ""With its 2.5 percent yield [and a] new CEO who is very energized, I think you could do a lot worse than Intel as a slow-and-steady way to play the 5G buildout.""
Third up is communications technology giant Qualcomm, whose president believes that ""virtually all 5G mobile devices launched in 2019"" will be embedded with Qualcomm's 5G tech.
""If Qualcomm's 5G business was an independent company, it would be the obvious winner here,"" Cramer said, acknowledging that Qualcomm's stock has been under pressure of late because of the company's ongoing intellectual property dispute with Apple, its largest customer.
""I'm optimistic about Qualcomm's long-term prospects when it comes to 5G, but if you want to buy it, I recommend building a position gradually over time because you might get more weakness,"" the longtime stock-picker said.
Broadcom is another way investors can play the 5G buildout, though Cramer admitted that the sprawling chipmaker was ""far from a pure play"" on the next-gen network.
""My only hesitation here is that Broadcom has run so much,"" he said. ""That said, the darned thing still, even after that rally, sells for just 10 times next year's earnings estimates, Hock Tan is a fabulous CEO and he's been buying back stock hand over fist. My view? Broadcom's terrific, but if you don't already own it, you might want to wait for a pullback to pull the trigger.""
Last but not least is Xilinx, a programmable logic device maker that recently reported what Cramer saw as ""one of the biggest blowouts"" of this earnings season. He attributed the strength, in large part, to its 5G rollout efforts.
The ""Mad Money"" host's only qualm was Xilinx's overseas business lines. While they're still strong, Xilinx's China business which accounts for roughly 25 percent of its total sales poses a risk while the trade war continues, he said.
""I like the stock of Xilinx so much, ... I re-named my new rescue mutt Xilinx,"" Cramer said. ""But if you're going to buy the stock at these levels, you need to understand that this is the high-risk, high-reward way to play 5G.""
So investors have options if they want to try and profit from the rise of 5G. And even though telecommunications stocks might seem to be the best bets, stock-pickers shouldn't ignore the chipmakers that actually build the tech, Cramer argued.
""The 5G buildout has arrived and there are a host of semiconductor companies that are poised to benefit,"" he said. ""At the moment, Skyworks is my favorite because it's so darned cheap and [CEO] Liam [Griffin] is such a good manager [that] they've finally got investors focused on the 5G future, but you can make the case for all five.""

249,The Fed's next rate move is more likely a cut than a hike: Economist Mohamed El-Erian,"The Fed is likely to hold interest rates steady for the entire year after hiking four times in 2018, predicts the Allianz chief economic advisor.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/05/mohamed-el-erian-fed-next-rate-move-more-likely-a-cut-than-a-hike.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-05T14:06:00Z,"The Federal Reserve is likely to hold interest rates steady for the entire year after hiking four times in 2018, predicted economist Mohamed El-Erian.
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
El-Erian, the chief economic advisor at Allianz and former Pimco chief, told CNBC Tuesday that he sees a 50 percent to 55 percent chance of the next Fed move being a cut that would happen sometime in 2020. Back in December, the Fed had projected two rate increases this year. But few in the market still expect that path.
And another tool to tighten-up monetary policy, the unwinding of the Fed's balance sheet, or portfolio of assets, ""certainly will go off autopilot"" in 2019, El-Erian said on ""Squawk Box.""
The central bank is aiming to reduce its more than $4 trillion worth of bond holdings by up to $600 billion this year by not replacing maturing assets.
El-Erian thinks that balance sheet plan will be altered. ""It will alter it both the notion of the destination and the pace."" He refused to the put numbers on the destination, saying its data dependent.
On the matter of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell having dinner Monday evening with President Donald Trump, El-Erian said, ""It was really important that this happened this week, and not last week"" before the central bank's January policy meeting. ""Had it happened before the pivot, we would be having a completely different conversation,"" he added.
El-Erian said that Fed chiefs meeting with presidents is normal and has happened plenty of times before. For example, Trump met with Powell's predecessor Janet Yellen in October 2017. When Barack Obama was in the White House, he met with Yellen in April 2016 and November 2014.
Trump, who nominated Powell to be Fed chairman, has been one of Powell's biggest and most vocal critics, blaming central bank rate increases for slowing the economy and roiling the stock market.
""I always feel it's important for two sides to hear each other and it reduces, but it doesn't eliminate, but reduces misunderstandings in the future,"" El-Erian. ""I think net-net this is neutral to slightly favorable to the market. But it's not a big deal.""
Meanwhile, El-Erian gives Powell a grade of ""A,"" saying anyone would have had troubling navigating the current economic and market conditions. Though he did call Powell's early October signal of four rate hikes for 2019 a mistake.
Powell did walk back those comments but the stock market plunged in the final three months of the year, hitting a closing low on Christmas Eve and a bear market decline of more than 20 percent from its record highs. Wall Street has staged a recovery since then, with January posting the best month of gains in stocks since October 2015.
El-Erian said Powell's proclamation after last week's Fed meeting of patience before any more rate moves reinforced the case to buy stocks ""expected return goes up, expected volatility goes down.""
""It played on expectations that liquidity would be accommodated, if needed. And therefore, you can be more comfortable going back to the old view ... look at dips as perhaps buying opportunities,"" he added."

""This was the quarter where we realized that you need to pay the piper to get sales on the internet, and in most cases, the piper is Alphabet's Google, hence its 22 percent revenue growth,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
Cramer noted how many company executives have cited their direct-to-consumer businesses as areas of strength, a sign that companies like Alphabet are becoming increasingly important in driving revenue. He also called attention to how few people carry shopping bags these days on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, a well-known retail hub, which could mean consumers are browsing in store before buying products online.
""Whenever you hear some executive say 'direct to consumer,' ... you should immediately think Facebook, Amazon and, most importantly, Google, because their ads are how you sell things directly to the consumer,"" he said. ""If you're a retailer, you need to pay Google for advertising, just like you had to pay rent on Fifth Avenue in the old days.

251,Google head of internet security says businesses should ignore scare stories and learn from history,"In an exclusive conversation with CNBC, Google's head of security and privacy says businesses have more to learn about their own insecurity from the history of cybersecurity than from frightening headlines or scary pitch decks drom vendors.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/09/google-infosec-head-heather-adkins-ignore-scare-stores.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-09T19:04:00Z,"There are a lot of scary cybersecurity headlines, and many shiny new solutions from vendors that promise to address those threats.
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
Ignore them and look at history instead. That's the advice of Google's Heather Adkins, who has served for 16 years as the head of information security and privacy at the tech giant.
Adkins has witnessed many landmark cyber events from the front lines. She says the attacks, methods, motivations, tools and even criminals themselves are the same as they've been since the 1980s. History is a better teacher for businesses than a frightening pitch deck from a vendor, she says.
U.S. government-backed research papers from as early as the 1960s started to outline the problems we would see today, she told CNBC. Government workers back then spoke of new threats they saw as the government went from single-use, big mainframe computers to shared environments.
Here are a few examples of how things have evolved -- and how they haven't.
Nation states attacking weak links. One landmark for Adkins was Clifford Stoll's 1989 book, ""The Cuckoo's Egg"". Stoll, a computer lab worker at U.C. Berkeley, discovered that hackers from East Germany were systematically trying to break into university computers to capture military secrets.
""What happens today is still very similar,"" she said, ""especially when we are thinking about the root causes of attacks, including things like the Equifax hack.""
In other words, nation-state hackers target companies like Equifax, banks or universities to get important secrets, rather than wasting all of their resources on the more heavily fortified government agencies themselves.
Old methods of attack keep resurfacing. The methods for distributing malware and viruses have grown and become easier, but they haven't changed that much on a technical level.
Take for example the Morris Worm, one of the first internet worms distributed widely over the web. A computer worm is a piece of malicious software that can replicate itself, sometimes very rapidly, distributing itself across connected computers.
Worm attacks largely fell out of practice, but then came back in style in 2017 when criminals attached worms to ransomware -- which shuts down a user's computer until a ransom is paid -- in attacks like WannaCry and NotPetya. These worm-style attacks spread globally in very rapid fashion, causing havoc at companies like FedEx and Maersk.
The vehicles for transmitting hostile software may be roughly the same, but their availability and ease-of-use has exploded, Adkins said.
""At the time of the Morris worm, the people exploiting [computers] were mostly just curious people. But today, it's different. There's an extraordinary amount of knowledge available -- you don't have to know very much. You can go out and for $20, buy a spying kit, and use that for your own purposes,"" she said.
In another example, email schemes have become far more sophisticated than the ""Nigerian prince"" schemes of 15 or 20 years ago. But attacks convincing people to wire money or enter their bank credentials are still going strong, and the basic idea remains the same: A scammer sends a fake email that tries to trick a recipient into providing information they shouldn't.
This slow evolution provides an advantage for the back-end machine learning tools Gmail uses to identify them. The company has gotten better about catching the these attacks and providing more information about them, like whether the fraudulent message was sent by a nation-state.
The old rules are the best rules. Adkins said sometimes the marketplace suffers from a ""proliferation of cybersecurity professionals"" offering conflicting advice on passwords, antivirus software, safety practices and so on.
But the best rules for individuals looking to secure their personal information are the classics, Adkins said.
Keep your software up to date, and don't re-use the same password. Criminals rely on simple hacks that exploit old software problems, and when a company is breached, data stolen frequently includes passwords and usernames. If you use those same terms elsewhere, criminals can easily break into your other accounts.
Here are some more of Google's up-to-date email security rules to consider as well.
""Things have grown and changed so much, but really so much of what we do has stayed the same or is based on these very well used concepts,"" said Adkins. ""Doing these well-known basics can still go a long way in being more secure."""

""Whatever you do, I don't want you to try to be a hero here. After today's shellacking ... you might be tempted to just start buying stocks in the weakness,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""But given the market's massive run-up in a pretty short period of time mind you, I think it's a little too soon to put new money to work. We were due for a sell off and I doubt it will be finished after just one day.""
Why should Wall Street worry when the earnings season has been strong and the markets are up this year? Because American and Chinese officials are far from finalizing a trade deal, companies have been offering weak guidance, and economic slowdown in Europe is weighing on sentiment.
Major U.S. indexes all shed more or less 1 percent in Thursday's session.
""I don't want you to get too bearish and I like the way the market came back from its lows, but we actually did some selling at the open today for my charitable trust [because] the averages are still way, way above the levels where we wanted to do some buying originally,"" Cramer said. ""So there's no reason to break discipline here.""
While the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 7 percent this year, Cramer said the market has been bolstered by hopes that the U.S. and China could seal a trade agreement before a 90-day tariff truce ends and the Federal Reserve would pull back on interest rate hikes this year.
""Now one of those wishes came true. The Fed stopped tightening, at least for the moment and became more grounded in reality,"" Cramer said. ""But if this move was going to continue higher, we needed the other wish to come true, too. A trade deal before the tariffs on Chinese imports automatically go higher on March 1.""
The Dow fell as much as 300 points at one point Thursday after CNBC reported that President Donald Trump is unlikely to meet with his counterpart Xi Jinping to close on a deal. That could send markets lower because ""the stock markets very much wants a deal,"" he said.
U.S. trade officials want China to stop taking technology that could be used to rival America as a ""hegemonic superpower,"" while Chinese officials may be prolonging the standoff because of divided government in Washington, Cramer said.
""Normally you would be able to buy the stocks that came down hard on a day like today, but we know that these groups--technology, aerospace, industrials--all have the most to lose from no trade deal,"" he said. ""Sure their earnings tended to be very strong, but the future looms darker than the past if we can't work something out with China pretty quickly.""
In general, the earnings season has been strong including good quarterly results from Facebook, Snap, Starbucks, and Capri Holdings, Carmer said. But guidance has been weak including companies such as Twitter, Tapestry, and Fireeye among others, which is another reason why traders sold on Thursday, he said.
Cramer suggested investors could wait three days then buy shares of Twitter.
As cybesecurity stocks have been ""red hot,"" Fireeye ""shocked investors and me with its weaker outlook."" The stock finished down 12 percent Thursday.
In addition to U.S.-Sino relations and weak guidance, Cramer said weakness Europe is draining crude business. Eurozone forecasts have caused oil to tumble and the trade issues have exacerbated the issue, he said.
""When oil dropped more than a dollar in the morning you know the bulls were in for a beatdown,"" Cramer said. ""Given that oil is at the top of the range, we might get another bushwhack tomorrow if oil gets closer to $50 tomorrow.""
The ""Mad Money"" host acknowledged the merger between Suntrust and BB&amp;T, and earnings from Chipotle and Masco were positives, but not enough for traders.
""We have to own that it was a bad day for the bulls and it's pretty realistic to expect ... a couple more sessions like this one until the facts get more positive,"" Cramer said. ""So until we either get lower prices or a brighter outlook, I think you should hold off putting any new money to work until we get to safer levels.""

253,"National Enquirer publisher believes it 'acted lawfully' on Bezos story, vows to investigate matter",AMI had been accused by Bezos on Thursday of threatening to post sexual pictures that Bezos had texted to his mistress.,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/08/national-enquirer-publisher-believes-it-acted-lawfully-on-bezos-story-vows-to-investigate-matter.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-08T14:10:00Z,"American Media on Friday said it ""acted lawfully"" in reporting the Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos infidelity story, but nonetheless will ""promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims.""
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
AMI had been accused by Bezos on Thursday of threatening to post sexual pictures that Bezos had texted to his mistress. The Amazon CEO made the bombshell accusation in a blog post, wherein he accused AMI of blackmail and extortion.
The denial also follows an immunity deal with prosecutors struck in December that requires publisher of David Pecker's National Enquirer to commit no crimes. AMI's board of directors comprises four people, including Pecker.
AMI claimed that when Bezos accused it of blackmail, the company ""was in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him."" 
The AMI statement, provided by a company spokesman to CNBC, continued: ""Nonetheless, in light of the nature of the allegations published by Mr. Bezos, the Board has convened and determined that it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims.""
Bezos had written that ""Of course I don't want personal photos published, but I also won't participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks, and corruption. I prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out.""
AMI's assertion that it violated no laws in its reporting matters beyond the Bezos affair. In December, the tabloid publisher struck an immunity deal with federal prosecutors in connection with the $150,000 hush-money payment the supermarket tabloid gave to a Playboy model who claims she had an affair with President Donald Trump.
That agreement requires that AMI ""shall commit no crimes whatsoever."" If it turns out that Bezos' blackmail allegations are confirmed, AMI could lose its immunity.
Brett Kappel, a lawyer specializing in political finance and ethics at Akerman LLP, said AMI's immunity deal could be at risk. 
""AMI is looking at the very real possibility that it may be found to have breached the non-prosecution agreement and could be prosecuted both for the crimes that were the subject of the non-prosecution agreement and any subsequent crimes,"" Kappel told CNBC.
""In addition, the lawyers involved will almost certainly face disciplinary proceedings by the New York State Bar and could be disbarred,"" Kappel added.
Read the full statement here:
""American Media believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos. Further, at the time of the recent allegations made by Mr. Bezos, it was in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him. Nonetheless, in light of the nature of the allegations published by Mr. Bezos, the Board has convened and determined that it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims. Upon completion of that investigation, the Board will take whatever appropriate action is necessary.""

When clients come to him, he gives the following advice:
 Know what it is you want to doThe clearer your goal, the more likely you'll achieve it, said Ackerman.
He said he tries to get his clients to visualize exactly what they want, since they're usually more willing to make changes once they have a goal in mind.
Ackerman said he once told a client who wanted to go on vacation to get a guidebook for that specific location to make it more real.
""The more you can polish up the future so that it looks appealing, the more likely you are to make changes today to get the thing you want tomorrow,"" he said.
 Cut out little expenses
Once you have the goal in mind, take time to look at your daily and household budgets, and ask what you can take out of that budget to put into your bucket list account.
Review your credit card receipts, Ackerman said, since that's where most of the recurring bills are.
Be sure to look for the expired trials or subscriptions you may not use often. When was the last time you watched Hulu or used Amazon Prime?
Eating out is the biggest expense. ""Everybody does it more than they think they do,"" Ackerman said.

Takes money to make money. On Wall Street, Amazon had great fourth quarter results but signaled it would spend more this year on warehouses and other infrastructure and warned of problems in India. That sent its stock price, up 20% over the past year, down 4% in premarket trading on Friday. In the fourth quarter, Amazon’s sales rose 20% to $72.4 billion and profit of $6.04 per share was up 61%.

Both digital ad giants were using the platform to distribute to regular users special apps that likely didn’t meet Apple’s regular app store privacy rules.

256,The Backlash Against Cashless Stores Is Growing,New Jersey is one step closer to outlawing cashless shops and restaurants. Philadelphia is considering similar legislation.,http://fortune.com/2019/02/08/cashless-stores-new-jersey-law/,"{'id': 'fortune', 'name': 'Fortune'}",2019-02-08T15:16:53Z,"New Jersey legislators last week passed a bill forcing retailers to accept paper money, a move that takes aim at the growing number of restaurants and shops that are going cashless. By far the most prominent name in that space is Amazon, whose Go convenience stores are not only cashless; they’re cashier-less, with surveillance technology and an app allowing customers to bypass the checkout.
If New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy signs bill A591 into law, retailers in the state will have to offer customers the option to pay in cash. Philadelphia’s city council is due to vote on a similar bill next week, and the state of Massachusetts has long had a policy against cash-free businesses. As Fortune reported in 2016, a 40-year-old Massachusetts law says retailers cannot discriminate against a cash buyer by requiring the use of credit.”
The argument behind the New Jersey bill is that cashless stores marginalize customers who do not have access to credit. Any effort by retail establishments to ban the use of cash would be discriminatory towards those people, argues New Jersey lawmaker Paul D. Moriarty, a sponsor of the bill. Moriarty is also sponsoring a bill that would prevent landlords from requiring tenants to pay via electronic funds transfer.
Another case against the cashless movement was put forward by financial advisor Milo M. Benningfield in a commentary for Fortune; he argues that “frictionless” transactions could lead to irresponsible spending.
Amazon and Walmart expressed concerns about the New Jersey bill last summer, after which lawmakers shelved a vote on it, according to the The Philadelphia Inquirer. Amazon has at least one cashless bookstore at a mall in Paramus, N.J.
Proponents of the cashless movement argue that it reduces the risk of theft and violence that paper money can present. Last year, Union Square Hospitality Group CEO Danny Meyer wrote that four restaurants in his group were going cashless for safety and efficiency reasons, despite the possible effects on people without bank accounts or credit cards: “As an organization devoted first and foremost to our employees, we determined that the benefits for our teamparticularly their safetyoutweighed the unintended side-effects for a small segment of our guests.”
Businesses adopting cashless models, it should be said, are responding to consumer behavior in the crucial 25-to-44 age group; the cohort uses cash just 25% of the time, according to the latest Federal Reserve Bank report. Overall, 30% of payments in the U.S. are still cash, and despite inroads by e-commerce, some 77% of all payments are made in person. Still, the youngest Americans are likelier than any other group to use mobile payments services, which may hint at the future of the cashless movement."

Shares of the internet giant rose more than 1.5 percent to $1131.56 on Monday, bringing its gain for the year to 8 percent.
Barclays Ross Sandler thinks Alphabet's stock performance could be something to watch, saying, ""We think 2019 could be a better year for GOOGL shares than 2018's flat performance.""
Baird analyst Colin Sebastian calls Alphabet a top pick for the year and believes cloud expansion, YouTube growth and strong search during macroeconomic headwinds will help the stock this year. 
Under new Google cloud boss Thomas Kurian, Sebastian expects a, ""meaningful acquisition,"" and that a ""Flexible balance sheet allows Google Cloud to go elephant hunting.""
Some analysts were more cautious than others.
 ""We have somewhat greater concerns about growth into 2019 due to Amazon's ad business and GOOGL's large base,"" said J.P. Morgan's Doug Anmuth, who is staying overweight into Alphabet's earnings report regardless.

258,Apple investors still lack a reason to get really excited about the stock,"The market already knew the bad that would be in Apple's earnings after the tech company preannounced weak quarterly iPhone sales, and now the tech stock is rallying.

A new iPhone is expected in September, but ""expectations are pretty modest and it won't be all that different than this year's,"" Sacconaghi said.
""What drives excitement around the stock is new products,"" the Bernstein analyst said, and he added that a new video content service would be the kind of idea that could help shape greater investor enthusiasm.
Apple CEO Tim Cook talked up the opportunity in video on the earnings call, telling analysts, ""We see huge changes in customer behavior taking place now. And we think that it will accelerate as the year goes by to sort of breakdown of the cable bundle that's been talked about for years. And I think that it'll likely take place at a much faster pace this year. And so we're going to participate in that in a variety of ways.""
There are reasons to be skeptical of Cook's assessment, at least his rapid timeline for the change. And the Apple CEO didn't reveal any breakthrough video idea.
He mentioned Apple TV, which ""you're well familiar with,"" Cook said.
In addition, the company's Wi-Fi streaming tech AirPlay 2 has support on a number of different third-party TVs. And third-party video subscriptions are available through Apple, and ""that's going to accelerate into the future as the bundle breaks down and people begin to buy likely multiple services in place of their current cable bundle,"" the Apple CEO said.
Original content will increase beyond some marquee deals already announced (e.g. Oprah).
""But today I'm not really ready to extend that conversation beyond that point. We've hired some great people that I have a super amount of confidence in, and they're working really hard, and we'll have something to say more on that later,"" the Apple CEO said.
Sacconaghi asked Cook on the earnings call about the all-important iPhone upgrade cycle fact that efforts like Apple's battery-replacement program and making the iOS operating system work with older models is changing the iPhone average replacement cycle and that it could stretch out even further in years to come.
""The cycles the average cycle has extended,"" Cook said. ""There's no doubt about that. We've said several times I think on this call and before that the upgrades for the quarter were less than we anticipated. ... Where it goes in the future, I don't know, but I'm convinced that making a great product that is high quality that is the best thing for the customer, and we work for the user. And so that's the way that we look at it."""
259,Amazon added a first-ever warning about counterfeit products to its earnings report,Amazon is finally warning investors of one of the biggest problems facing its online marketplace: counterfeit products.,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/04/amazon-10k-warns-investors-about-counterfeit-problem-for-first-time.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-04T18:19:00Z,"Amazon is warning investors of one of the biggest problems facing its online marketplace: counterfeit products.
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
Under the ""risk factors"" section of its annual report, Amazon added a new line addressing counterfeit problems on its marketplace.
""We also may be unable to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, selling goods in an unlawful or unethical manner, violating the proprietary rights of others, or otherwise violating our policies,"" the filing said.
The disclosure reflects Amazon's increased concern over the counterfeit problem on its marketplace, as the words ""counterfeit"" and ""pirated"" were never mentioned in its annual filing before. While Amazon publicly says it has a ""zero tolerance"" policy for counterfeit products and has built new technology to deal with the problem, its marketplace that allows third-party merchants sell goods continues to be plagued by knockoffs.
It's a problem that could get worse, as Amazon is shifting more of its sales to third-party sellers. More than half of the products sold on Amazon came from third-party sellers in 2017 for the first time, and in its most recent quarter, Amazon said that third-party products accounted for 52 percent of all products sold.
Amazon's counterfeit problem has drawn the attention of major retail brands as well. In October, The American Apparel &amp; Footwear Association, which represents more than 1,000 brands, recommended that some Amazon sites should be added to the ""Notorious Markets"" list because of counterfeits, saying Amazon should rather ""be a leader in the fight against counterfeits.""
Bigger brands like Daimler AG have also raised flags. In 2017, the German automaker filed a complaint alleging trademark infringement by Amazon for failing to prevent the sale of counterfeit Mercedes-Benz parts.
Earlier last year, a widely read blog post written by Elevation Labs' founder Casey Hopkins pointed out how counterfeits make business tough for small companies like his. In the blog post, Hopkins wrote about his experience dealing with Chinese counterfeiters that flooded the marketplace with copies of his product, killing his brand reputation and sales along the way.
""Customers are unknowinglybuying crap versions of the product, while both Amazon and the scammers are profiting, and the reputation you've built goes down the toilet,"" Hopkins wrote.

div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
""Everyone who dumped Apple or Facebook or Microsoft earlier this earnings season now has a serious case of seller's remorse. I think the same could be the case with Amazon and Alphabet,"" he said on ""Mad Money."" ""Don't be distracted by short-term problems that can vanish overnight like we saw with these winners. Focus on the long term, and the next time one of these terrific stocks sells off, then you know it's time to buy.""
Apple's stock, for one, got some reprieve after the company's negative first-quarter pre-announcement. Expectations were so low ahead of its late-January earnings report that the iPhone maker actually managed to surprise to the upside.
But for much of last month, Apple's stock was trading close to its 52-week lows, only catching fire after the company released its latest results. Shares of Apple ended Monday up 2.84 percent, at $171.25.
And while Cramer wasn't sold on J.P. Morgan's suggestion that Apple buy a company like Activision Blizzard, Sonos or Netflix, maintaining his call that the tech giant should get into health care, he stressed Apple's positive long-term outlook.
 ""Given that Apple's stock is up more than $20 bucks since we spoke to [CEO] Tim Cook, I sure hope that something's going on here besides the possibility of positive trade talks,"" he said.
Investors saw ""the same kind of whiplash behavior"" in the stock of Facebook ahead of its report. The embattled social media giant also surprised Wall Street when its earnings results showed little impact from its data privacy scandals.
""Yes, Facebook did a lot of shady stuff, but when we saw the numbers, we realized it didn't matter to the people who do matter, which are the users. More than 2 billion people use some form of Facebook every day. The advertisers love them, it seems, more than ever. You may hate Facebook I think a lot of people do but it's not going anywhere,"" Cramer said. ""Its stock turned out to be the steal in the tech group.""
Microsoft's earnings report showed some less obvious weakness: a chip shortage put pressure on the company's personal computer business, which prevented it from blowing away analysts' estimates, Cramer explained.
""The chip issue wasn't surprising. Somehow, though, it surprised the people who owned Microsoft, which is why they unceremoniously bailed out on it,"" he said. ""To me, that's a huge mistake you shouldn't sell Microsoft because of a temporary short-term issue when the long-term story, particularly Azure, is so strong. Sure enough, the stock rallied nicely today.""
Amazon's problems were even less clear, but Cramer saw the sellers seize on two particular ones: a new rule in India that poses an obstacle to Amazon's business, and an overarching concern that the e-commerce company's retail gross margins have peaked.
""No one seemed to notice the dominance of Amazon Web Services. Remember that? That was supposed to matter. No one cared about the growth of the advertising business,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said, likening Amazon chief Jeff Bezos to an NFL coach. ""Why would you assume that Jeff Bezos won't change his game plan, come up with something new? He'll adjust to the gross margin pressure. He'll figure out another way to win.""
""Of course, that does require patience, something that's in real short supply in this market,"" Cramer continued. ""But that's good news for anyone who's willing to think long term and buy high-quality stocks into weakness.""
Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet.

GolfPass, which NBC is officially launching on Tuesday, will cost $9.99 per month or $99 per year. It's designed for people who already play golf but could use additional incentive to hit the links.
It's NBC's latest effort to seek revenue beyond the traditional pay-TV bundle by experimenting with a direct-to-consumer subscription. While GolfPass has Netflix-like elements, it's a closer parallel to Amazon Prime, said Will McIntosh, Golf Channel's executive vice president, at a press briefing in New York on Monday. The purpose is to encourage hobbyists to play more golf as well as giving them additional viewing options.
""It's sort of like, for me, like Golf Channel 2.0,"" McIlroy said at a press briefing Monday. ""If you're going to start a golf business, you probably wouldn't do a 24-7 TV station or network like what happened 25 years ago.""
Included in the package is a round of golf each month at one of 7,000 global golf courses that partner with online booking company GolfNow, which is also owned by NBCUniversal. They'll receive a dozen golf balls from TaylorMade, a provider of equipment for McIlroy, and a variety of discounts on golf resorts, apparel and accessories.
While no live events will be broadcast on the GolfPass app, archived rounds and more than 4,000 on-demand instruction videos, including several from McIlroy and his coach, Michael Bannon, will be available to subscribers,
A premium membership, GolfPass+, costs $199 per year and includes additional benefits such as waived booking fees, cancellation protection and extra discounts."

The note is the latest in Morgan Stanley's ""Space Disruptor Series,"" which features commentary on 90 companies by Morgan Stanley's ""Space Team,"" which is led by Jonas.
Spaceflight Industries has two businesses: The all-in-one launch services unit, known as Spaceflight, and a satellite imagery unit called BlackSky. The former ""has launched 210 satellites"" to date, Morgan Stanley said. Spaceflight isn't slowing down, either, with contracts to launch about 100 satellites this year.
BlackSky represents the company's reach into satellite operations. The unit successfully launched two satellites at the end of last year, Global-1 and Global-2, and expects to launch six more this year. Spaceflight Industries aims to eventually have constellation of 60 satellites to provide high-resolution photos of Earth nearly on demand.
The company announced a $150 million fundraising round in March for the first 20 satellites of the BlackSky constellation.
Additionally, BlackSky is one of several companies working with Amazon Web Services for the recently-announced AWS Ground Station business. Amazon's cloud business is building a network of satellite connection facilities, representing the e-commerce giant's first public move into space-related hardware.
Ground stations are a vital link for transmitting data to-and-from satellites in orbit, used by companies engaged in a variety of activities like weather forecasting, communications and broadcasting.

264,Alphabet reports earnings on Monday — investors want strong numbers amid ad threats from Amazon,Alphabet's costs to doing business have gotten steeper.,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/04/alphabet-earnings-preview-q4-2018.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-04T13:09:00Z,"Alphabet is set to report fourth-quarter earnings Monday. Investors will want to see strong advertising numbers amid threats from Amazon and rising costs to doing business.
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
Google, which makes up the vast majority of Alphabet's business, is increasingly seeing Amazon encroach into its core advdertising business. Revenue in Amazon's ""Other"" category which the company says is ""primarily"" made up of ad sales more than doubled from 2017 to 2018, coming in at $10.1 billion last year, according to financial filings. CNBC reported in October that some advertisers were moving as much as half their search budget from Google to Amazon.
Meanwhile, Alphabet's costs of doing business have gotten steeper.
Traffic acquisition costs the fees Google pays to companies like Apple to be the default search engine are projected to reach $7.62 billion this quarter, according to StreetAccount.
That's an increase of 16 percent from the previous quarter and of 18 percent from the fourth quarter of 2017 a significantly larger jump than the 2 percent to 3 percent changes that Google's seen in TAC in recent periods.
TAC as a percent of advertising revenue is forecast at 23 percent, in line with previous quarters.
Net income for the fourth quarter is expected to dip from the previous quarter. FactSet consensus estimates put profit at $7.64 billion, down from $9.19 billion during the third quarter.
All of that on top of growing revenue suggests a slimmer margin.
Indeed, Alphabet is expected to post $38.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, according to Refinitiv consensus estimates, an increase of 15 percent from the third quarter and 20 percent from the year-ago quarter. But quarterly operating margins are projected at 22 percent, according to StreetAccount, down from 24 percent and 25 percent from the previous quarter and the year-ago quarter, respectively."

WHERE: CNBC.com's Speakeasy with John Harwood
As the House Democratic majority begins wielding power, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., is among its tallest lightning rods. In her three decades on Capitol Hill, she has built a reputation for fiery advocacy on behalf of her constituents in a majority-minority Los Angeles district of below-average incomes. Now she will conduct oversight of the titans of Wall Street. The House Financial Services panel once considered a ""juice committee"" for its ability to deliver big donations to members has the first African-American, and the first woman, to wield the gavel of the chair. For years, Waters has clashed energetically with the Republican right, which has made her a target on ideological and ethical grounds. But for all her high-volume rhetoric, Republican lawmakers credit her as a trustworthy colleague with a practical streak that can, at times, produce bipartisan cooperation. A wary business community hopes it can work with her in the same way. Waters, 80, sat down with CNBC editor at large John Harwood in her office on Capitol Hill to discuss her reputation, her legislative agenda, and her determination to unearth the financial secrets of Donald Trump the president who likes to deride her as a ""low-IQ"" adversary. A partial transcript from Speakeasy with John Harwood featuring Rep. Maxine Waters follows.

John Harwood: So you think the ""Angry Maxine,"" the ""Kerosene Maxine,"" has been exaggerated?
Maxine Waters: I don't know about those labels. I do know this, that oftentimes right-wing conservatives will label you, they will call you names. I think you have to look at where it comes from. If it comes from people who are diametrically opposed to me and my philosophy, and what I care about and what I've worked on, then it is not credible, and so I pay no attention to that.
John Harwood: At one point during the campaign you said about bankers, ""What I'm going to do to you is fair. I'm going to do to you what you did to us."" So you recently met with Jamie Dimon of J.P. Morgan, David Solomon of Goldman Sachs, what did you do to them?
Maxine Waters: Well, first of all, let me just say this, when you are speaking and you are among friends and you're with an organization that you have great relationships with, you take the opportunity to have a little fun, to perhaps describe to them in ways maybe you wouldn't describe to other people how you're going to do things, and you get them basically involved in understanding what you care about and what you have learned from your time in office, and you make these kind of quips so 
John Harwood: So people shouldn't take that literally?
Maxine Waters: Not literally. Yes, absolutely. I have an open door. I welcome everybody. From bankers, to activists, non-profits, the veterans, people involved in the health industry. Even if you know you disagree with a particular industry, you let them in and you let them talk to you.
John Harwood: Are there particular issues where you think there's a very good chance that you'll be able to work with those financial institutions?
Maxine Waters: I think the work that I have done already as a ranking member of the Financial Services Committee demonstrates that I'm a strong legislator and I know how to work with the opposite side of the aisle. I know when to work with the opposite side of the aisle.
John Harwood: Are there issues where you think you can work with the Trump administration? I saw recently that they say they want to do GSE reform, for example. That is something that you have said you are interested in.
Maxine Waters: You have to pay attention to the way that the president himself has defined himself. He has defined himself as someone that you can't trust, that does not tell the truth, and that will change his mind and tweet something one day and the opposite the next day. It's up to the administration to determine that they need to develop the kind of credibility and trust that they can work with other people.
John Harwood: I talked the other day to your old friend Barney Frank, who used to have this job, and he said, ""Let's face it, there's not going to be much legislating in this Congress. It's mostly going to be about messaging."" But you also have soft power. You've got the ability to use your position, to make points to regulators, to make points to industry. What do you think you can get done there?
Maxine Waters: Here's what you can do effectively: You can lead your committee and define what we care about as Democrats, what I care about. We can deal with our issues. And even if they got all the way to the president's desk and he would not sign them, we're ready for 2020.
John Harwood: So you're preparing arguments for your party for 2020?
Maxine Waters: Oh absolutely. Yeah, I'm not depending on the president to sign legislation that may pass the House and the Senate and get to his desk. If that happens, that's fine, but we will have said to the public, ""This is what we care about. This is what we are working on, and this is what we will do when we have all of the power that we need to get it done.""
John Harwood: You've got hearings to hold that you can make points on.
Maxine Waters: That's right.
John Harwood: Your first one is with the credit industry. Is that right?
Maxine Waters: Mm-hmm.
John Harwood: Can they expect to get a tongue lashing from you?
Maxine Waters: Well, if you watch what I have done in all of the hearings that I have provided leadership for the Democratic caucus and the Financial Services Committee, you will see that I have conducted myself in a way that would solicit information and have responses in a very normal way. But there have been times when I've been challenged, and I have to challenge those who are in the witness chair, or I have to demand that they respect my time.
John Harwood: Do you think you can get them to change their behavior merely by having a hearing even if you can't legislate?
Maxine Waters: I do think it may back some people down. It may cause some people to rethink. We'll see, because we will have credible witnesses that have never had the opportunity to share their advice, and their opinions, and their experience.
John Harwood: One thing people on Wall Street talk about is headline risk, that is negative publicity can damage them. If you have hearings on a financial institution and have something negative to go after them on, it could affect, for example, their stock price. Do you care about that?
Maxine Waters: I think none of us should be irresponsible in the way that we deal with financial services issues. I do know that the president does not understand this. He doesn't know the relationship of his remarks to the stock market. I also know that when you have a financial institution that comes before you, and they have been involved in activity that they have received a lot of fines for, that they continue in the activity, activity such as one bank that continued to create accounts in their client's names.
John Harwood: You're talking about Wells Fargo now.
Maxine Waters: I really am. It is legitimate for you to ask those questions, even if it is embarrassing. We're talking about trying to get the truth about what is going on in institutions where people have obviously been harmed, and what are you going to do about it?
John Harwood: I've seen a comment or statement from you that suggested that you might want to actually put Wells Fargo out of business. Is that true?
Maxine Waters: No, it's not true. Anybody that understands the importance of the banking community to the economics of our country would know that you don't just wish to put somebody out of business. It's about asking the questions about your ability to understand your own bank. It is about trying to understand why problems continue to exist and what can be done about that.
John Harwood: Do you fundamentally believe that the American banking system and financial markets are forces for good in making the American economic engine run?
Maxine Waters: I believe in our economy, we have to have banks. That's very central to the economy and the way it works. But I do believe that their interest is in making money. I believe that as a business making money is okay as long as you are not doing what we consider rip offs. We want banks to operate in such a way that they don't undermine the mission of providing credible services to the average citizens.
John Harwood: What about the idea that the only obligation of a corporation is to make money for its shareholders, and that that's what makes capitalism run?
Maxine Waters: If a bank, or any business feel that it's okay to do anything to make money, there's something wrong with that philosophy. Undermining, taking advantage of, overcharging, targeting, being unfair is not okay for any business, and certainly it's not okay for the banks.
John Harwood: Barney Frank, your predecessor, told me that he thought that Jeb Hensarling was not an effective chairman because he was so ideological, he was so far right, even for some in his own party. Are you just the opposite? Are you as ideological as Jeb Hensarling on the left?
Maxine Waters: I don't think so. Look at what I've done on the export/import bank. I was one of their biggest advocates, and I worked very hard with some that others would not expect me to work with. I held my meetings at the chamber of commerce office in Torrance, California. This business about whether or not I can work with others, whether or not I can get along, I've proven myself.
John Harwood: The reason I ask the question is you've been very critical, for example, of Ben Carson, the Housing Secretary and said that he believes that if people are poor, that's their fault.
Maxine Waters: Yes, that's right.
John Harwood: One of your Republican colleagues told me that you're the opposite that you think if people don't do well, that's the system's fault, and that your principal interest is not generating growth, but redistributing money from people who have a lot of money to people who don't.
Maxine Waters: Well I don't know who said that, but it's simply not true.
John Harwood: What role, in your philosophy, does redistribution of income take?
Maxine Waters: I'm not defined in that way that I believe in redistribution because that implies that you want to take from the rich and give to the poor. I'm defined about fairness. I'm defined in a way that would create equal opportunity, not only fairness, but your government having a role and seeing to it that all of their departments and agencies are operating on behalf of all the people, and that the least of these, or just the average Joe Blow working every day is not taken advantage of.
DIGITAL EXTRAS:
WATERS ON TAXES
Video: https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/31/where-rep-maxine-waters-stands-on-raising-taxes-on-the-rich.html
John Harwood: Your new colleague, Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, who's going to be on your committee. She's talked about a 70% top marginal rate. There was a question about that at the Davos Conference the other day, and everyone in the room laughed like that was a ridiculous idea. Do you think it's a ridiculous idea?
Maxine Waters: I heard what they did at Davos when this was talked about. I believe in fair taxation. I believe that people who make lots of money should be taxed fairly, and they should not be relieved of that responsibility because they have the money, the resources, and the wherewithal to get around the law, to basically take advantage of the law. I just want fair taxation. I don't want 
John Harwood: Do you think a system could be fair with a 70% top marginal rate?
Maxine Waters: I know that that would be very different in the way that it is looked at now, but don't forget we have heard stories about secretaries paying more than their rich bosses. That's not right. Based on the so-called tax reform that this president did, I know this. I know that the top one percent or so was advantaged. And I know that major corporations and businesses really did reap a lot of benefits from that tax reform. You know what I'm worried about? I'm worried about that Joe Blow that goes to work every day and he's making $50,$60,$70,000 for their family and maybe they get behind and maybe they owe $10,000 or $15,000 that they need to work out payments with the IRS and they're pounded. And people like Mr. Trump, who won't show his tax returns, is able to manipulate the IRS so he's never really called to task, and he's able to take those laws and make sure that he works them in such a way that they're to his advantage.
WATERS ON DEUTSCHE BANK AND MONEY LAUNDERING
Video: https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/31/maxinwhat-maxine-waters-hopes-to-uncover-about-deutsche-bank-money-laundering-and-trump.html
John Harwood: What is your objective in the joint investigation that you plan with Congressman Schiff of Deutsche Bank?
Maxine Waters: We know that Deutsche Bank is one of the biggest money laundering banks in the country, or in the world perhaps. And we know that this is the only bank that will lend money to the President of the United States. He won't show his tax returns and we have a certain information that leads us to believe that there may have been some money laundering activity that might have been connected with Mr. Manafort, with some people in his family.
John Harwood: Do you believe that money laundering has been a significant part of President Trump's business?
Maxine Waters: I know that there are a lot of rumors. I think we need to learn more about the finances of the President of the United States, and he's hiding that information from us. We need to delve deeper into that and find out what is going on and whether or not money laundering has been involved and whether or not there are connections with the oligarchs of Russia.
John Harwood: Do you believe, based on what you know now, that the president is corrupt?
Maxine Waters: I believe that this is a problematic president who has proven that he has taken advantage of others. The attorney general of New York made him reimburse at least $25,000,000. We know that he has had bankruptcies. We know that there are a lot of stories he hasn't paid contractors, he hasn't paid subcontractors. We know a lot about the history of this president and it doesn't look good.
John Harwood: Now, do you think that the fact that you've taken some criticism about conflicts of interest you were on a watchdog group's list of most corrupt members of Congress does that undercut your ability to pursue these issues?
Maxine Waters: No it doesn't. No, absolutely not. First of all, all of the questions were answered, I was totally exonerated and found not to have done anything wrong. It was simply a non-profit operation that decided that it was going to take on the responsibility of choosing members that they didn't necessarily like. But whatever they tried to do to me didn't work because it was proven that I had done nothing wrong.
John Harwood: You are one of the earliest members of Congress to call for the impeachment of the president.
Maxine Waters: Yes.
John Harwood: Do you think is it plain to you right now that that's where this is headed?
Maxine Waters: Absolutely.
WATERS ON DIVERSITY AND INCOME INEQUALITY
Video: https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/31/rep-maxine-waters-says-we-have-to-make-the-system-work-for-everyone-.html
John Harwood: When you were born there was one African-American in Congress, just a couple of women. Now you're the chair of this committee. How does that make you feel?
Maxine Waters: A lot of people talk about it as if this is so unbelievable. How could this have happened? How did you do this? Well, I was taught no matter what the circumstances were, that America was a place where everybody could achieve and become what they want to become if they work hard, if they're dedicated to it. I believe that, and that's what I've done. I've worked hard.
John Harwood: The United States' economy has we are the richest in the world. We've made some significant gains the black middle class is a lot bigger than it was. But we still have tremendous income inequality and wealth inequality.
Maxine Waters: That's right.
John Harwood: What does that tell you about what's worked, and hasn't worked, about the American economy and the American financial system?
Maxine Waters: Well basically, we understand that people of color, poor people, have not had a combination of resources and wherewithal to really deal with a system that was not organized necessarily to improve them or their quality of life or invest in them. And so in understanding that, you basically understand that this wealth gap was created and that unless we pay attention, unless we work at it and understand how it happened, we wouldn't be able to change it. But some of us believe. Some of us believe that we are smart enough, that we work hard, and that we can achieve. And no matter what the system does, we're going to keep trying and we're going to keep inspiring and motivating young people to make this democracy what it should be.
John Harwood: Now, you've established, as I understand it, a diversity and inclusion subcommittee on this committee.
Maxine Waters: That's right.
John Harwood: What do you hope to achieve with that?
Maxine Waters: I hope that we can gather the information, do the research, and help people to understand how big the gap is and what can be done in order to close that gap. And I think, looking in the financial services community, we can put together the kind of information that help people to understand that women and minorities don't really play in this arena, and that we have to do more to close that gap.
John Harwood: You're talking about executive hiring?
Maxine Waters: No. I'm talking about diversity in every aspect of our society, number one, but certainly in the financial services. It is, for example, if you go to college and you study economics, or you get involved in a job that brings you to a point where you should be seriously considered for management or other high level jobs, it should be done in a fair way. Your application should not go in the wastebasket because of your color.
John Harwood: Do you think that financial services companies should be required to have more diverse boards than they have now? Is that something that you would pursue?
Maxine Waters: What we are doing now is we are encouraging the CEOs to understand that diversity is a positive thing. For all the studies that have been done, it shows to the degree that a business or a company is diverse, that it does better.
John Harwood: So you're about encouraging, not requiring?
Maxine Waters: I'm not about trying to changing any laws, necessarily. But I'm about using whatever leverage and whatever power I have to help make it happen.
John Harwood: You have the most diverse 2020 presidential field in the Democratic party's history. What do you think about that and who do you like?
Maxine Waters: I'm not surprised, as we emerge and we become more advanced in understanding our possibility, and understanding our influence, that we should be competing at every level - in every business, everywhere. That's what's beginning to happen.
John Harwood: Do you think it's important for the Democratic party to have a nominee who reflects that diversity?
Maxine Waters: I think Republicans should learn how to have diversity in the Republican party. I think the Republicans should understand that they are trailing way behind in getting to the point where they have an appreciation for other races and other cultures.
John Harwood: You haven't picked a candidate?
Maxine Waters: Oh no, it's too early. As a matter of fact, I wouldn't tell you now if I had.

266,Cramer calls on eBay to work with activist investor Elliott Management,"Jim Cramer argues that, together, eBay and activist fund Elliott Management can create a lot of value at the e-commerce company.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/01/cramer-calls-on-ebay-to-work-with-activist-investor-elliott-management.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-01T23:31:00Z,"Elliott Management's recently announced $1.4 billion stake in eBay could create real value if eBay's leaders cooperate with the activist hedge fund, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday.
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
""The guys at Elliott have some great ideas that could potentially make shareholders a lot of money. At the same time, eBay's management team is a lot better than you might think if you were only looking at the stock's recent performance,"" he said on ""Mad Money."" ""If eBay and Elliott can work together, then, like Humphrey Bogart and Claude Rains in Casablanca, this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""
In the last year, eBay has gone from posting strong results to delivering imperfect quarters, which has led to a good deal of destruction in the stock. Shares of the online marketplace are down nearly 26 percent in the last 12 months.
""The problem? Slowing sales growth at the company's core marketplace business,"" Cramer said. ""Specifically, eBay's gross merchandise volume the total volume of stuff that gets sold on their platform slowed from a high-single-digit growth rate near the end of 2017 to a flat growth rate by the end of last year.""
Enter Elliott, a well-respected activist hedge fund run by billionaire Paul Singer. Last week, the firm disclosed a 4 percent stake in eBay and publicly released a letter to the board of directors with a plan to get eBay's $34.31 stock to $55 or even $63 by the end of next year. Shares of eBay vaulted 6 percent in a day following the announcement.
Elliott's plan is fivefold:
Get eBay to consider spinning off its StubHub and Classifieds divisions. (These areas are seeing rapid growth, but may not be getting the valuation they deserve by being buried in eBay's sprawling business, Cramer explained.)
Get management to focus its efforts on the core online marketplace.
Cut costs through a variety of ways.
Return more capital to shareholders.
Find the right people to oversee the turnaround.
""The most encouraging sign for me? Elliott ended their letter not with demands, but with a simple request that management take their ideas seriously and work with them for the good of the business,"" Cramer said.
The ""Mad Money"" host saw the biggest point of potential conflict being the spin-offs of StubHub and Classifieds, which eBay CEO Devin Wenig highlighted on the company's most recent post-earnings conference call. But he did add that eBay is constantly reevaluating its holdings, so it's possible he's more open to the idea than it seems, Cramer said.
As for Cramer, he thought Elliott's plan for the two businesses was ""dead right."" He explained that Classifieds, a Craigslist-like service, is ""already designed to operate independently,"" and argued that ticket exchange platform StubHub could be a lot more valuable as a standalone company or a subsidiary of a related player like Live Nation, which owns Ticketmaster.
""Remember, eBay spun off PayPal back in 2014 and that's been a huge win for shareholders why not do it again?"" he said.
Right now, the catch is that it's unclear whether Elliott will push for new management or a new board of directors. But considering Wenig's history at the company during which he pushed for the spin-off of PayPal, improved the customer experience, pushed eBay to the top of its categories and repurchased a great deal of stock Elliott could actually be ""pleasantly surprised,"" Cramer said.
""If Wenig and Elliott can find a way to work together here, I'm very optimistic and believe the stock could have a lot more upside,"" he said. ""Elliot Management has done a ton of research into eBay and I think they make some very good points, but I want to stress that the best person to implement their plans is the [company's current] CEO, Devin Wenig. If, like me, you believe that eBay and the activists can work together, then the stock is absolutely a buy here, even after its big move up since Elliott's announcement.""

267,Hot stock tips for free: Watch Trump’s State of the Union speech,"Here are some areas the president is likely to touch on, which could generate movement in their sectors",https://business.financialpost.com/investing/want-a-hot-stock-tip-watch-trumps-state-of-the-union-speech,"{'id': 'financial-post', 'name': 'Financial Post'}",2019-02-04T20:35:17Z,"Clues on trade policy are likely to be top of mind for stocks investors watching President Trump’s State of the Union speech Tuesday. Trade remarks may influence equity sectors from footwear to auto parts, while pharma stocks may be volatile if the president zeros in on drug costs reforms, and financials and housing may be overlooked.
Trump is expected to reference a few areas “where both parties can agree” — including prescription drug prices and infrastructure plans — “but it is difficult to imagine the rhetoric turning into reality when Washington has struggled to keep the lights on,” Compass Point’s Isaac Boltansky says. Boltansky expects the speech to focus on “economic growth, immigration, a few bipartisan mirages and the wall.” Still, this year’s speech may mean less for investors than it has in prior years, as the State of the Union has become “more pomp than policy,” he said.
Trump is likely to “focus on his ‘Promises Made, Promises Kept’ mantra to ensure that the ‘America First’ base of supporters turns out again in force,” Beacon Policy Advisors wrote in a note. “As such, executive actions restricting immigration, lowering drug prices, implementing trade restrictions, and other foreign policy initiatives will be front and center.”
Here’s what to watch:
Trade
“Next steps with China” are the most important trade point, Height Capital Markets’s Clayton Allen said. He expects Trump will “aggressively claim concessions from the Chinese,” while discussions with the European Union are a “dark horse,” as “everyone seems to have let this go to the back burner, but there is still a lot of potential tension.” Allen also expects additional threats to pull out of NAFTA in an attempt to force Congressional support for the USMCA, and “aggressive rhetoric around Venezuela, but no announcement of additional actions.”
Trade is likely to occupy “a substantial portion” of the speech, as legislative action from Congress during the next two years is unlikely, so Trump needs to prioritize “areas where he can enact change unilaterally,” said Veda Partners director of economic policy research Henrietta Treyz. She expects Trump to “leave the door open for further tariffs … but message that progress is being made.”
It’s also possible Trump may focus on the USMCA in a bid to be “flashy,” and “attract headlines” that would trigger the “combustible momentum you’d need to get action from the House or Senate before July 2019,” Treyz said. The president may also indicate his willingness to impose tariffs on foreign automobile imports in an effort to “shore up the automobile industry to protect our national security.”

Much like Trump’s trade agenda, “the speech will likely flow between the two poles that anchor the Administration’s macro trade policy: Tariff Man vs. Art of the Deal,” Cowen’s Chris Krueger wrote in a note. “We will be listening closely for any discussion of the biggest trade variable: auto and auto parts tariffs.”
If Trump mentions NAFTA, automakers and parts suppliers will be the names to watch: General Motors, Ford, Dorman Products, Visteon Corp., Delphi Technologies, American Axle &amp; Manufacturing, Standard Motor Products, Aptiv Plc and Cooper-Standard. Regarding relations with China, keep an eye on industrial companies Caterpillar Inc. and Boeing Co.
Commodity investors may find comments on trade talks with China of particular interest, as industrial metals, such as copper, have been whipsawed by concerns over demand from China as the trade war stings. They’ll be looking for hints ahead of Trump’s March 1 “hard deadline” in trade negotiations, and China’s Vice Premier Liu He’s upcoming Washington meetings.
Retail
If Trump can assure observers that the U.S. and China are moving closer to a trade deal, “apparel and footwear companies will rally” as the probability of tariffs on finished goods eases, Bloomberg Intelligence’s Chen Grazutis said. That might also mean China’s economy will return to faster growth, “a positive for global brands that are counting on sales there.”
Companies including Nike Inc., Under Armour Inc., Canada Goose Holdings, VF Corp., Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Gap Inc., Ralph Lauren Corp., and PVH Corp. are a few apparel and footwear stocks with tariff exposure or that seek to expand in China.
Infrastructure
This will be a big area to watch as Trump is said to make a renewed push for spending in the sector, widely seen as a rare spot of bipartisanship in Washington. While the topic had been sidelined amid raging debates over tax reform and immigration, many experts see a plan making some inroads this year. Stocks to watch include Eagle Materials, Martin Marietta Materials, Emerson Electric, Eaton, Masco, Vulcan Materials, as well as railroad and airline companies.

Health Care
Trump is likely to tout his administration’s long-awaited proposal to end a complex system of drug rebates that’s been blamed for helping keep prices high. The measure, announced on Thursday, could hand the president a potential win on drug pricing if passed.
Besides directly targeting middlemen such as pharmacy benefit managers, the policy is a “clear negative” for makers of expensive drugs that use rebates to fend off competition from cheaper alternatives, said Veda Partners analyst Spencer Perlman. Sell-side analysts at Wall Street firms had mixed reactions as health-care supply chain stocks fell on Friday.
Defence
“Trump’s defence spending priorities will be interesting to watch because we’re still really trying to gauge where he stands,” James Bach, Bloomberg Intelligence government analyst said. In general, “Trump has overseen some pretty significant increases in discretionary appropriations. There hasn’t been a lot of noise around cutting spending as of late, so it would be notable if he does bring this up.”
Stocks to watch include Lockheed Martin Corp., Raytheon Co., Northrop Grumman Corp., General Dynamics Corp. and Boeing.
Energy
Trump may flag sanctions on Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, PDVSA, that effectively block the nation from exporting crude to the U.S. That’s left U.S.-based refiners including Valero Energy Corp. searching for alternative sources of heavy crude oil. Goldman Sachs recently noted Valero, Citgo, PBF Energy Inc. and Marathon Petroleum Corp. are the main U.S. refiners exposed to Venezuelan crude imports.
Financials
“We’re not expecting President Trump to really focus or provide new views for the financial sector,” Bloomberg Intelligence’s Nathan Dean said. Trump is likely to “be content to let regulators continue their path towards regional bank de-regulation.”
Housing, Housing Finance
Housing probably won’t be “one of Trump’s hottest topics” during the speech, Bloomberg Intelligence’s Ben Elliott said. “If it gets a mention, it’ll probably be indirect or will just be a few seconds.” Even though housing finance reform and plans for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been under scrutiny lately, the president is unlikely to extensively discuss them, Elliott added.
There’s a chance Trump “mentions the administration’s intent to end the conservatorship of the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) but we think any comments will probably just be in passing and lack specificity about the administration’s plan,” KBW’s Brian Gardner wrote in a note.
The Wall/Shutdown Concern
Height Capital Markets’s Allen will also be watching for how much Trump emphasizes “other ways to get his wall” as another “shutdown seems like it hinges on an emergency declaration.”

div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
In an SEC filing, the company said Giannetto will continue in his role until the company appoints a successor.
Sonos reported earnings per share of $0.55. The company posted quarterly revenue of $496 million versus $491 million expected, according to Refinitiv. The company reaffirmed guidance for its 2019 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. It expects EBITDA of $83 million to $88 million on revenue of $1.25 billion to $1.28 billion.
Sonos was an early pioneer in wireless home audio, but faces increasing competition from lower-priced offerings from tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Apple.
In a letter to investors, Sonos said its growth in Europe was slower than expected since the growing adoption of voice in the region was skewed toward low-priced products. 
""So, while we believe we benefited from consumers upgrading to Sonos in North America, our growth in Europe was slower as voice is in an earlier stage of adoption,"" Sonos wrote. ""As European consumers increasingly embrace voice technology, we are optimistic we will benefit from a similar step-up trend in Europe in the future.""

div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
""Oh my God, have these guys not learned anything? Because common sense alone would say, 'You're going after Jeff Bezos, and you're putting it in writing?' There's nothing private anymore. It's going to be a public document. So what is their motive?"" Zakim said on CNBC Friday
Zakim appeared on ""Squawk Box"" just before a statement from National Enquirer-parent American Media, Inc., denying Bezos' claims that he was being blackmailed. ""American Media believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos,"" said AMI's statement adding, however, the board determined ""it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims."" 
The AMI board consists of four people, including Pecker and David R. Hughes, a former Trump casino executive.
In Thursday blog post headlined, ""No thank you, Mr. Pecker,"" Bezos claims that AMI asked him to publicly deny any political motivation in its coverage of his divorce in exchange for not publishing photos he texted Sanchez, including a ""below the belt selfie."" Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, announced their divorce on Jan. 9. Later that day, the Enquirer broke news about Bezos' affair with Sanchez.
""I think Pecker did it not because necessarily to help Trump but he knew it was going to sell a lot of copies of the Enquirer and gain a lot of publicity because here we are talking about it. It's the top story everywhere,"" said Zakim, corporate communications chief from 2004-2006 at Pecker's American Media, owner of the National Enquirer, Men's Journal, and other publications.
Zakim referenced Trump because the president has been friends with Pecker for years, and the president has been a frequent critic of Bezos, founder of Amazon and the owner of The Washington Post. He's the world's richest man with a fortune in excess of $133 billion.
""The 'catch and kill' is not a new concept [for tabloids]. This has been going on for a long before it got broken with Trump,"" said Zakim, now president of Bridge Strategic Communications. ""There was a falling out, we thought, between Pecker and Trump when all of sudden the National Enquirer stopped covering him as lovingly as they did"" and then when Pecker agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.
""I'm not sure [the president is] aware of it. And I'm not going to get into a conversation about something between Jeff Bezos and a tabloid magazine,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told CNBC, when asked about the Bezos matter.
Amazon has not responded to CNBC's requests for comment.

270,Analysts are sticking by Alphabet in the face of the stock drop. Here's what they had to say:,Analysts are sticking by Alphabet but want more transparency from the internet giant,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/05/heres-what-the-major-analysts-had-to-say-about-alphabets-earnings.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-05T12:57:00Z,"div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
Wall Street analysts were rattled by Alphabet's increased spending but largely defended parent of Google, saying they didn't believe investors fully understood the stock and more transparency from the company about all its big long-term bets would help the stock.
Analysts also were trying to make sense of Alphabet's increased competition in digital advertising, rising costs, and renewed margin concerns. Despite all that, some analysts even raised their price targets saying the company was still a good long term buy.
In pre-market trading, the internet giant's stock is down 2.5 percent trading at $1141.42.
""There were likely several bright spots within revenue growth (such as YouTube and possibly cloud), but lack of disclosure conceals business trends, while the ongoing investment in cloud, hardware and YouTube content is pressuring margins..."" Bank of America analyst Justin Post said in his earnings recap note to clients. He went on to say, ""Overall, a somewhat frustrating (quarter) for a business seemingly on a good trajectory.""
Continuing the theme of transparency, Morgan Stanley's Brian Nowak said, ""4Q highlights the strength of GOOGL's core and portfolio of assets, difficulties in modeling (quarterly) ins and outs, and need for better transparency.""
Barclays analyst Ross Sandler opened his note to clients saying, ""But margins are still imploding in 4Q.....revenue growth remains stellar, but the pace of margin erosion continues to disappoint, based on mix shift &amp; one-time items.""
""We maintain our overweight rating, but prefer other FANG names Facebook, Amazon,&amp; Netflix to Google,"" noted J.P. Morgan's Doug Anmuth.
Expenses were also a concern for Mark Mahaney at RBC who said, ""Growth remained very consistent though expenses came in higher from Other COGS, including costs related to YouTube, &amp; R&amp;D.""
Analysts at UBS and Deutsche Bank actually raised their price targets with Deutsche Bank noting, ""We feel good about the near and long term ability for Google to sustain top line growth given 1) its 8 properties that each have over 1B monthly users, 2) the leverage that AI/ML brings not only to the platform, but also to newer initiatives such as Cloud and Waymo, as well as 3) the hardware business that is gaining momentum.""

271,Full transcript: Spotify CEO Daniel Ek discusses podcasts and competing with tech giants,Spotify CEO Daniel Ek discussed the company's podcast acquisition plans and investment in original content in an interview with CNBC.,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/06/full-transcript-spotify-ceo-daniel-ek-on-cnbc.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-06T18:01:00Z,"JIM CRAMER: It's funny. I like the Apple service revenue stream. And when I saw it, I know this company, the big one, it's a Brooklyn company, so I followed Brooklyn companies because I lived there, I was hoping that Apple would make this acquisition. The reason I say that is because people don't -- unless you listen to the podcasts, they are very millennial, and they are very much the way people multitask now. Do you see yourself buying all of them that are left?
DANIEL EK: I don't think we have to buy all of the companies that are in this space. There is a tremendous a lot of these companies. What we feel very strongly about is we want to be in the game, we want to be the platform that these creators come to and go to. And, again, as you mentioned, I would say -- we're very much focused on being audio. Video is a huge space. It has the attention of everyone right now. But we think audio being almost two hours of consumption per day is a massive opportunity that no one is really paying attention to.
JIM CRAMER: Wow 
DAVID FABER: You said you have line of sight, sorry, Jim, on 4 to 5 million on multiple acquisitions this year. And then you just said that may double, am I correct? So it could be as much as a billion in 2020?
DANIEL EK: Not really in terms of just acquisitions. What I was talking about our content investments that we're making. So part of what you should look in terms of our going forward forecast is both acquisitions, but then it's also our own efforts in investing in creating these shows. We had 14 exclusive shows in the fourth quarter of 2018. We're doubling down on that. And we want to grow the number of shows that we have.
JIM CRAMER: I am so impressed with the subscribers by region. It's something that you originally told me, your company told me could happen. Just gonna go 30% North America. Latin America, 20%. Rest of world 10. You're pretty much, year-end here, you're up 40%. Does podcast, do they fly in every region?
DANIEL EK: Yes. You would be surprised. It has grown very, very fast. Germany is a great example. We're already there. The number one player of kids shows right now, so you see young consumers are going to bed with Spotify, listening to stories in a big, big way. So, even the perception in Germany wouldn't be that Spotify is just about music, it is really all about audio already.
JIM CRAMER: So this is important because when I watch Netflix, I never watch it in dubbed. I always watch it -- you have to watch the titles, it is a different show than if you listen. Will you translate everybody's great stuff for United States?
DANIEL EK: I think there is definitely that opportunity of taking the shows that are working really well in these different geographies and translating them across the world.
DAVID FABER: What about the car? Do you have a sense as to how many people are listening to you in an automobile?
DANIEL EK: Yeah. I mean, we're doing very, very well in the car. I think last number we gave out is that there are more than 50 million of our users who are using Spotify in the car. So it is definitely a big part of our business.
DAVID FABER: And do you -- do you have any sense the growth of that? Obviously there is competition in the car in the form of Sirius, which many people know, but even beyond that, some of the others. Is it growing substantially?
DANIEL EK: It is growing really, really substantially. I think the number one metric that we look at is dual platforms. How many of our users are using it on more than one platform? And what we're seeing is that that number is increasing dramatically as more speakers come into play, as cars are getting more and more connected. So it is really a big part of our story. The other thing that we see is those people are more than twice as engaged as the average user as well. So it is an important part of our overall story.
DAVID FABER: When you look at the competitive landscape, Daniel, obviously you were early, you sort of -- in the days of piracy, you transformed and really streaming, you've been the leader. But Apple is out there with a product. We don't talk very often about it. Amazon. They're both incredibly deep pocketed companies. Do you believe if they wanted to that they conceivably could spend enough money to push you out of your leading market position?
DANIEL EK: I mean, these are formidable companies. No doubt. But what I look at is obviously how our business is doing and we had a phenomenal Q4. The other part that I look at is we're really just focused on audio. That's how you should look at this. There is a ton of things that these other companies are doing, self-driving cars, whatever other businesses they're into. And I believe in this day and age that you need to be very, very clear with your brand, what you are for consumers, in order for them to take it up. And the best experience wins. And now we're adding the best content to that as well. And that's now Spotify.
JIM CRAMER: I don't know whether you're familiar with Tien Tzuo's work from Zuora, but the subscription economy and subscriber's, it's a great book, he always says ""Watch churn."" Churn shows you loyalty. You've got some of the stickiest churn I've ever seen.
DANIEL EK: Yeah. And it is trending as you can see, the churn is decelerating.
JIM CRAMER That's positive we should tell people that that's good.
DANIEL EK: Yeah, yeah. Churn is definitely decelerating which is a very positive metric that we're keeping track of. And of course, at the same time, you should look at the announcements that we're doing today as I mentioned, it broadens the appeal of Spotify, it increases the engagement. If it increases the engagement, we think it has the opportunity of also lowering churn even further.
JIM CRAMER: And how about Google?
DANIEL EK: Yes, Google is obviously the same category as I guess all of the other FAANG companies.
DAVID FABER: It wasn't that long ago that you guys went public. I remember it. I don't think you were actually even here at the time. You chose to list as opposed to raise capital. Are you happy with that decision?
DANIEL EK: I am. Indeed. It was obvious that a big decision for us to make, but it felt like the Spotify way of doing it. It wasn't just about doing it for the sake of everyone else doing it. And we've always said that we're a long-term thinking company, and I think we proved that with that move.
DAVID FABER: Tell me more, what does ""the Spotify way"" then mean? It just means doing it differently or the way you need to?
DANIEL EK: It's about being transparent and it is about, in this case, trying to align the incentives of everyone. And in our case, we didn't need to raise additional capital. And we wanted a way to provide not just our existing shareholders with liquidity, but also our employees. And that was an important part for me of avoiding that traditional lockup process for our employees.
DAVID FABER: And well, for the sake of transparency, we're very happy to have you, but sort of curious as to why you're suddenly communicating in this way. Can we expect to see more of you in this sort of a public setting, articulating some of the things you've just done here? Or is this going to kind of be a one-time only and we'll never see you again?
DANIEL EK: No, I certainly hope to be available and transparent. That's certainly what we want to be as a company. And I would encourage both of you or everyone else, by the way, to reach out to me on social platforms and I'm happy to respond to questions there as well. But I think this is obviously -- marks a shift in terms of people's perception what have this company is. And that it's very important for us to state very clearly why it is and that we're excited about this future.
JIM CRAMER: Let me go back to something that we wanted to drill down on -- sharing stuff. This Google. I didn't want Google to be a throwaway. The premium subscribers. Google Home promotion marked the first hardware bundle offer ever in history. This worked big for you. Are we going to see Amazon? Are we going to see -- who else do you do this with? Because to me this is premium, and premium is the way that I want to judge you.
DANIEL EK: Yeah. I mean, we have as a core part of our strategy we call ubiquity, which is being on all platforms.
JIM CRAMER: Good.
DANIEL EK: So we've got 500 of these partnerships going, and obviously what we saw was our members were asking for these voice speakers. We saw a clear opportunity to provide that with an amazing experience. We saw that people who were already fans of the google assistance wanted the Spotify experience, so we'd be happy to extend that so Samsung, of course.
JIM CRAMER: Right.
DANIEL EK: And happy to work 
JIM CRAMER: Samsung's car, because can you do with Infotainment and do it with HARMAN.
DANIEL EK: Yes. Of course.
JIM CRAMER: What do you think of Facebook?
DANIEL EK: Facebook, again, is an exciting company. We have a long relationship with Facebook. If there are opportunities, we would love to work with them.
JIM CRAMER: So you don't mind what happened with Facebook in terms of the world -- you are a company driven by morality. You have no problem with Facebook.
DANIEL EK: No, look. I mean, at the end of the day we want to be where our users are.
JIM CRAMER: Fair enough.
DAVID FABER: Just getting back to many so of the financials and things that some of your investors care about. What are your expectations in terms of negotiations with the labels and what's going to actually occur there?
DANIEL EK: Well, our focus, and I believe that's their focus as well, is really about: how do we grow the entire music industry? I've said before on our earnings call that the focus for us in these round of negotiations is really about enabling the marketplace. And that's a crucial point because it isn't a point about them losing and us winning or taking the points of the margin here or there at their expense. It's really about getting rid of the inefficiencies that exist in the music industry by creating tools that make it easier for artists and fans to connect and making it easier for labels to market --
DAVID FABER: You have access to enormous amounts of data that conceivably would be helpful in terms of where people are listening, how they are listening and who they are listening to.
DANIEL EK: Exactly, including the 16,000 data points that we're gathering every single day through the taste profiles. That's a huge part that we're able to connect these two in a way where it's positive for users and really positive for artists as well.
JIM CRAMER: I don't want to be too Bobby Kennedy-like, but if we just think about now, no, but if we dream things the stickier you are, I'll go back to the churn, I mean, a lot of people looked at Netflix at $6.95, They said it's never going to be anything. I mean, when I see the low churn, I think that one day you could raise prices, that you're a little bit more stickier, and, therefore, we should be modeling higher prices down the road.
DAVID FABER: $14.99 is enough, I think.
JIM CRAMER: No, come on.
DAVID FABER: What do you think?
DANIEL EK: I mean, look, again, all I can say right now is we're in this growing the market phase. We're not in trying to capture all the profits side.
JIM CRAMER: David, take the commercial side. Go listen to the commercials if you have a problem with 14.
DAVID FABER: I think we need to get into the podcasting business is what I think.
JIM CRAMER: Daniel, it was great that you came on. I hope you come back again. Daniel Ek--
DANIEL EK: Yes. Thank you for having me.
JIM CRAMER: -- with an unbelievable company that people better start understanding, because they will want to only stock if they do rather than the ridiculous four walls that the analysts are coming with -- with the neutral. I'm not neutral.

272,Anand Giridharadas on the fallacy of billionaire philanthropy,"The ‘insiders’ outsider’ says business elites are part of the problem, not the solution",https://www.ft.com/content/3729c71e-2419-11e9-8ce6-5db4543da632,"{'id': 'financial-times', 'name': 'Financial Times'}",2019-02-01T04:01:54Z,"Imagine you are young and idealistic. You want to make the world a better place. You also want your skills to have real impact. You could do worse than spend a few years at McKinsey or JPMorgan, right? 
Wrong, says Anand Giridharadas. The 37-year-old American writer wants to kill the idea that businesses, business people and business concepts are uniquely suited to solving the world’s social ills. 
His suspicions began as a McKinsey consultant in the 2000s. “I’m not saying the whole thing’s a fraud,” he says. “[But] if you’re there because you’ve been told that it is the only prep school for solving other problems, it’s not true!”
Giridharadas’s scepticism deepened as he watched how philanthropy and profit have merged over the past decade. Silicon Valley billionaires now argue that apps can achieve more than elected governments. Executives evangelise about social investing and triple bottom lines.
Giridharadas argues that such efforts purport to change the world — but actually keep it the same. His new book Winners Take All points out that the rich are obsessed by social “purpose”, at the very time they are hoarding opportunities. Framing problems as “win-win” excuses the rich from making real sacrifices. They have rigged the system as much through this idea as by any law. 
“I’m from a privileged background,” admits Giridharadas. “This is a book that grew out of familiarity.” His parents were first-generation immigrants from India: his father became a partner at McKinsey; his mother a homemaker and ceramicist. After studying at Michigan, Oxford and Harvard, Giridharadas watched his activist friends work for consultancies and banks, buying into the idea that it’s possible “to do good and to do well”. He became frustrated. He understood Donald Trump’s appeal as a politician who, for all his faults, recognised that many problems are “win-lose”.

Giridharadas, steeped in the elite culture he is critiquing, feared his book would make him unpopular. Thanks to Trump and Brexit, he now reports the opposite reaction. He has become the insiders’ favourite outsider. Larry Summers, former US Treasury secretary, called his book “required reading”; Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Marc Benioff (Salesforce founder) and Jack Dorsey (Twitter) have praised it. Giridharadas now occasionally texts Benioff on which philanthropic initiatives to support. 
What I’m trying to do is convince the public to stop outsourcing the changing of the world to plutocratic elites
“Most of what I’m trying to do is to convince the general public to stop outsourcing the changing of the world to plutocratic elites,” he says. But another aim is to encourage a few enlightened billionaires “to be traitors to their class” and support structural change. 
We are meeting in Tate Britain partly because the gallery is quiet and airy, but also because it illustrates one of the problems that exercises Giridharadas. Like many cultural institutions, Tate has received donations from the Sackler family, whose fortune comes from the drugs that caused the US opioid epidemic. Some argue that it’s better for people such as the Sacklers to spend their wealth on philanthropy than pleasure. 
Wrong again, says Giridharadas. “If they’d bought yachts, they would have been brought to justice by journalists and regulators and criminal investigators way faster,” he says. 
He wants us to stand up to abusive companies, instead of taking crumbs that they “give back”. “Why should an institution like [Tate] lend its prestige to people like that? I don’t think anyone here would care if this museum had three less rooms or had to give away 10 per cent of its art. Why are we all so afraid?”
Giridharadas seems like a man who has rarely been afraid. He is eloquent and confident, as befits someone whose two TED talks have more than a million views each. He grew up in Shaker Heights, Ohio, “famously one of the most racially integrated American suburbs”. When he was seven, his family found that “the adrenalin rush of being an immigrant had kind of crashed”, so they moved to Paris. 
There they realised “the ways in which America is unique”. In the US you could become American: neighbours took you to shopping malls, or gave you cheesecake recipes. In France his parents “were guests, and would always be guests”. 
After Giridharadas returned to the US, there were times when racists told him to “go home” and years when, as a writer, he struggled to afford health insurance. Overall, though, his life has been a validation of the American dream. “I’ve been very critical of many things about America, but I think I always criticise from a place of understanding the specialness of America,” he says. 
He realised as a 17-year-old intern at The New York Times that he wanted to be a journalist. But Jill Abramson, later its editor, told him to go out into the world and see what other people hadn’t. He finished his degree and looked for a job that would take him to India. India was “probably the country I most disliked in the world”. “It’s a common psychodrama among immigrant families — the first thing you know about India is your parents chose to get out of it,” he says. “But at some point in my mind that flipped around — of course I should go there.” 
What sort of company would take a 21-year-old graduate in the history of political thought to India? McKinsey, of course. “Within days, I was in a city I’d never been to, advising a pharmaceutical company, an industry I knew nothing about, on designing its leadership development system.”
This is bullshit that is so big and so powerful that it sneaks through undetected, like an odourless gas
The pharma company still went with his recommendations. “Only small bullshit gets called out,” he laughs. “This is bullshit that is so big and so powerful that it sneaks through undetected, like an odourless gas. I really thought it was crazy.” He lasted barely a year at McKinsey. Would he recommend that people work there? “No, I would recommend that many that are there leave.” 
But when Giridharadas then began working as a reporter for the International Herald Tribune in India, he celebrated the arc of technology and globalisation — “Microcredit’s going to empower all these people, apps are going to come in, women are going to get educated,” as he recalls it. He wrote India Calling, a book about the country’s rise.
Back in the US, he wrote another non-fiction book, The True American, about a Muslim man shot by a white supremacist after 9/11. Then he spent several years as a fellow at the Aspen Institute, where the great and the good talk about the world’s problems, and he became truly restless about inequality. 
In 2015, he was asked to give a speech at Aspen on the theme of forgiveness. Instead, he decided to talk about capitalism’s “extreme winners and extreme losers” — and to call out Aspen itself. “We here in Aspen are in a bit of a tight spot,” he told his audience. “Our deliberations about what to do about this extreme winning and losing are sponsored by the extreme winners. This community was formed by stalwarts of American capitalism; today we sit in spaces named after Pepsi (as in the beverage) and Koch (as in the brothers) . . . we are deeply enmeshed and invested in the establishment and systems we are supposed to question.” The speech went on to form the basis of his book. 
How do ideas emerge? Do they mushroom overnight or crystallise over years? Giridharadas’s thinking was fuelled by the work of Thomas Piketty. He seized on a sentence in the French economist’s 2013 Capital in the Twenty-First Century, which said that rising inequality relied, “perhaps primarily, on the effectiveness of the apparatus of justification”.
“Authors often leave breadcrumbs for future writers,” he says. “I just thought, that’s the breadcrumb he’s leaving.” Winners Take All has some wonderful examples of how the rich justify inequalities — by providing superficial, apolitical solutions. There’s the craze for power poses, which are purported to make women feel stronger in public. There’s Even, an app that addressed the problem of insecure work by charging people $260 a year to help smooth their fluctuating income. (It now charges a more modest $96.)
Giridharadas’s most effective critique is of those at the very top. The Sacklers are one set of villains. Social-impact investors are another. Larry Fink, head of the world’s biggest asset manager BlackRock, said last year that every company he invested in would need to have a social purpose. He spoke to a UN meeting about sustainable development. Giridharadas argues that Fink’s statement was “a cover to not change”, so long as BlackRock held on to its shares in companies such as ExxonMobil. (Investors such as BlackRock argue holding shares gives them more influence.) 
Then there’s David Rubenstein, the private-equity billionaire who styles himself a “patriotic philanthropist” for supporting causes such as the repair of the Washington Monument. The US government could simply fund such things itself, Giridharadas argues, if Rubenstein and others hadn’t argued for the egregious carried-interest tax loophole since the Reagan years. “The very people who most benefited from that laissez-faire, leave-business-people-alone [approach] now come and say it’s so sad that government can’t fix this problem,” he says. “They created the vacuum!”
Some billionaires are willing to give away almost all their money, but Giridharadas argues that this matters little if they won’t give up their power. “Mark Zuckerberg is not willing to have his company broken up.” 
While Piketty’s big idea was a wealth tax, Giridharadas’s is that the elite — if it really wants to change the world — should get out of the way. Zuckerberg, for example, should allow antitrust regulation. “The best form of [corporate social responsibility] is to stop lobbying.”

There are weaknesses in Giridharadas’s vision. Ezra Klein, the US commentator, has pointed out that US elites are probably more responsive today than ever. And business thinkers are aware that current efforts are not enough. Giridharadas quotes Michael Porter, the management theorist, complaining that companies are disconnected from local communities. John Elkington, who came up with the idea of the triple bottom line (social, environmental, financial), wrote last year that it was time for a “concept recall” — dismayed that it had become an accounting tool rather than a way to transform capitalism. 
Giridharadas champions government, but the shortcomings of the public sector are not myths. At the time of our conversation, the US government was in partial shutdown and the British government was choked by Brexit; neither seemed able to focus on challenges such as reducing carbon emissions. 
We’re often in scenarios where people are talking about the minimum wage, none of whom has ever worried about paying a bill
Though he advocates financial regulation, employee rights and the break-up of monopolies, Giridharadas spends little time on how to bring about these things. Would he stop employing consultants in government? He shies away from that, but argues that Wall Street types are currently “so over-indexed” — “we’re often in scenarios where a bunch of people are talking about the minimum wage, none of whom has ever worried about paying a bill”.
He is excited by the “marriage of community organising and political training initiatives” that was crucial in the election last year of New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Her ideas, he thinks, can appeal beyond the coasts: small businessmen in red states would support initiatives to crack down on tech monopolies. “They don’t like Amazon having [so many] lobbyists in Washington!” he says.
Giridharadas is wary of becoming a court jester, a critic who entertains with uncomfortable truths but who fails to change behaviour. “There’s a big risk of that,” he says. He lives in a “coastal, New York, intelligentsia bubble”, and is married to Priya Parker, herself a successful author and conflict mediator. He is not, in other words, part of a working-class revolt. 
While society’s ills have tipped other writers into pessimism, Giridharadas is notable for his optimism about the west. Partly it’s his experience as a second-generation immigrant, partly it’s seeing the depth of government failures in India. “America’s attempting something incredibly hard right now,” he says, describing its transition “from a majority-white superpower to this postmodern, post-ethnic-majority country”. 
Actually investing in your people’s ability to have decent lives that don’t make them pissed off every day is a really good bargain
This is the “end of an era, not the end of a country”. Real change — to reduce inequalities and protect the planet — is not implausible. If America could get more people into college, there might soon be stronger popular support for fighting climate change. If Britain could spend more on helping those adversely affected by globalisation, it might avoid populist spasms like Brexit. 
“We fail to make these investments,” he says. “Actually investing in your people’s ability to have decent lives that don’t make them pissed off every day is a really good bargain.” The language of win-wins is so pervasive — occasionally even he can’t resist it.

273,Warren Buffett learned this valuable lesson after buying his first stock during World War II,"""I bought my first stock in, probably, April of 1942 when I was 11...World War II didn't look so good at that time,"" Warren Buffett recounted at one of his annual meetings.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/07/warren-buffett-learned-this-valuable-lesson-after-buying-his-first-stock-during-world-war-ii.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-07T21:45:00Z,"Legendary investor Warren Buffett was asked at one of his famous annual meetings one time whether he was bullish or bearish? 
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
The 'Oracle of Omaha' had an amazing answer:
""You may have trouble believing this, but Charlie (Munger) and I never have an opinion about the market because it wouldn't be any good and it might interfere with the opinions we have that are good... If we're right about a business, if we think a business is attractive, it would be very foolish for us to not take action on that because we thought something about what the market was going to do, or anything of that sort....Because we just don't know. And to give up something that you do know and that is profitable for something that you don't know and won't know because of that, it just doesn't make any sense to us, and it doesn't really make any difference to us.""
The chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway learned this lesson, he recounted at Berkshire Hathaway's 1994 annual meeting, by realizing all the amazing and scary events of the 20th century that he had invested through since buying his first stock when he was just a young boy and how that in the end, long-term investing still worked out.
""I bought my first stock in, probably, April of 1942 when I was 11. And since then, I mean, actually World War II didn't look so good at that time. I mean, the prospects, they really didn't. I mean, you know, we were not doing well in the Pacific. I'm not sure I calculated that into my purchase of my three shares. But I mean, just think of all the things that have happened since then, you know? Atomic weapons and major wars, presidents resigning, and all kinds of things... massive inflation at certain times. To give up what you're doing well because of guesses about what's going to happen in some macro way just doesn't make any sense to us.""
While these comments were made more than two decades ago, they still hold true amid the divisive political headlines and volatile stock market of today.
Buffett's advice is to make a long-term bet on the American economy. Don't try to time bull and bear markets. Ignore the noise and look for solid companies at cheap prices. And buy those shares steadily over time, no matter the macroeconomic environment. If you're not a professional investor, Buffett advocates buying an index fund in the same fashion, never trying to time your purchases.
The 88-year-old investor has basically been making a massive bet on America this whole time. Through his steady stock and company purchases, Berkshire Hathaway has returned 20 percent annually the last 40 years, double the return of the S&amp;P 500 over that same time span, according to Factset.

div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
Now, even that tenet has been thrust into question. Sears' unsecured creditors took to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in White Plains on Monday to protest Lampert's bid for Sears. In cross-examinations of Sears' financial advisor, Lazard's Brandon Aebersold, and board member William Transier, the unsecured creditors' legal counsel dug into the uncertainty that persists around Sears' ability to grant continued employment.
Lampert, Sears' chairman, is purchasing Sears through an affiliate of his hedge fund ESL Investments. As part of the proposed deal, Lampert has said he is aiming to buy 425 stores, which equates to roughly 45,000 jobs. But the exact stores Lampert will continue to operate, and thereby the official number, has not been formalized. Lampert has until May to do so.
Meantime, Sears, which also operates Kmart stores, plans to close more stores in 2019 and beyond, a point its unsecured creditors raised in court.
Akin Gump's Joseph Sorkin, legal counsel to the unsecured creditors, asked Lazard's Aebersold how many stores the company plans on closing in 2019. When Aebersold responded that he did not know, Sorkin followed up about the number of jobs that could be impacted.
""Do you know how many employees will lose their jobs over the course of 2019 as a result of the plans ESL has?"" he asked. Aebersold likewise did not know the impact on jobs.
Lampert's bid, and its ability to save jobs, has become a touchpoint.
In a letter addressed to Lampert, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren recently wrote: ""I am concerned that under your leadership, Sears may continue to struggle and employees will continue to face uncertainty and anxiety over their future employment, and ongoing risks to their benefits and economic security.""
Meantime, workers rights group Rise Up Retail has been leading rallies of current and former Sears workers to advocate for the protections of workers following Sears' bankruptcy.
Sears declined to comment.

All references must be sourced to CNBC.
MELISSA LEE: Let's get right to our Squawk newsmaker of the morning. Joining us to discuss last night's State of the Union address, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Mr. Secretary, thank you so much for joining us.
STEVEN MNUCHIN: Thank you. It's great to be here with you.
MELISSA LEE: The President spent a lot of time in his speech proudly outlining the progress the administration has made when it comes to the U.S. economy. Trade, though, looms large when it comes to Wall Street's outlook for the economy, and outlook for corporate profits. And I'm wondering, as this is prolonged, as this process keeps going on, do you acknowledge that perhaps this could be a drag on that progress that Trump outlined so proudly last night?
STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well first, let me just say, the U.S. economy continues to perform extremely well and really we see a slowdown in Europe and other parts of the world but the U.S. economy is still very strong. And that really is a result of the present economic program which has always been tax reform, regulatory relief, and trade. And we're very pleased. Ambassador Lighthizer negotiated a great deal with USMCA. And that's one of the things we'll look for Congress to pass.
MELISSA LEE: Are you on your way to Beijing in a couple weeks? And how are you setting up for that meeting at this point? What's your outlook? Wall Street wants a deal, obviously. What can you tell Wall Street?
STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well, we had very productive meetings last week here in D.C with the Vice Premier. Ambassador Lighthizer and myself and a large team are on our way to Beijing next week. We are committed to continue these talks. We're putting in an enormous amount of effort to try to hit this deadline and to get a deal, so that's our objective.
MELISSA LEE: What does a deal look like? I mean, I think that, you know, parts of it, you know, tariffs, when it comes to tariffs, it could, in theory, be easy to say tariffs will be halted in terms of the escalation of tariffs, or tariffs could be lifted. The other parts of it in terms of structural reform are really big, much bigger, thornier issues. So can you tell us what a quote, unquote, deal could look like when you come away from those talks and whether tariffs will always be in place as long as the structural issues remain outstanding?
STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well, we are trying to reach a comprehensive agreement on a large range of issues. Now, the good news is we have been talking about these issues for over the last year. These are everything from structural issues to forced technology issues to the long list of issues that were in the 301 Report. And we are also very focused on free and fair trade for U.S. companies to have access there, and to have a more level playing field which will bring down the trade deficit.
BRIAN SULLIVAN: Mr. Secretary, it is Brian Sullivan. What happens if the USMCA is not approved? What happens then? If there's no NAFTA, effectively?
STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well, I'm not going to really comment on what would happen if it's not approved because this is something that Ambassador Lighthizer has worked very closely with both the Republicans and the Democrats. It's really an enormous step forward on a long range of issues. So I really don't see why this wouldn't be approved, unless we get to a situation where the Democrats just refuse to bring it to the floor. As long as the Democrats bring this to the floor, I think we're highly confident this will be passed.
MELISSA LEE: Mr. Secretary, I want to bring it back to China and this notion that, you know, you have been talking about these bigger structural reforms for the large part of a year now. That really underscores the notion that these are very hard issues to deal with. So given a March 1st deadline, Mr. Secretary, can you envision a scenario in which the tariffs are halted or even lifted, even as these structural issues are being worked out?
STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well, I don't think it would be productive to speculate on the outcome, because we have a lot of work left to do. As I've mentioned, there are a wide range of issues. We're working around the clock. If we can't get to the deadline, it's not because we haven't worked around the clock. I think there's a big commitment on both sides to try to meet this deadline. And we're working under the direction of President Trump and President Xi. So, hopefully we'll continue to make progress.
MIKE SANTOLI: Mr. Secretary, so from your perspective, are the Senate issues that you need as a threshold for making an agreement with China already on the table? Do you know which negotiating points right now are in play to get to that March 1st deadline?
STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well, one of the areas we made a lot of progress on last week was the area of enforcement. One of the things that's very important to us is if there is a deal that it's an enforceable deal. We don't want this to be an agreement that's not enforced. We need to do a little bit more work on the mechanism. But there are a lot of issues here. We're making good progress. There's still work to do. And I look forward to the trip next week.
MELISSA LEE: The purchase of soybeans, the offer to buy 5 billion tons of soybeans when the Chinese delegation was here not too long ago, was touted as progress. Maybe the Chinese willing to make a deal. Some people look at it a different way, that it's -- there's some irony wrapped up in the fact this is being touted as progress when really we want China to move away from a centrally planned economy and move to more of a free market. How do you read those tea leaves, if they are tea leaves at all, in terms of whether or not the Chinese are actually willing to come and make some progress on some of these other bigger, bigger issues?
STEVEN MNUCHIN: Soybeans are important to our farmers. We are a big supplier of soybeans. But let me just say, this soybean issue has been exaggerated and there's a little too much focus on just the purchase of soybeans. That's one of a lot of issues. And we're really focused, as we've talked about, on the structural issues. But the good news is the U.S. economy is doing terrific. We continue to have very strong jobs numbers. I think you've just begun to see the beginning of tax reform. I think you're going to see that kick in a lot again. And as the President talked about last night, his economic program is working. We're not going back to socialism. We're not -- we're going on an economic plan for America that works.
MELISSA LEE: In terms of the Chinese economy, we certainly have seen a slowdown, Mr. Secretary. And that has been viewed as leverage over the Chinese in making this deal. At what point, though, can you see that actually backfiring? Because a lot of U.S. companies clearly do business in China and feel that slowdown themselves which then in turn hurts the U.S. economy. We live in a global world and a slowdown in one of the fastest growing economies in the world certainly has effects elsewhere including the U.S.
STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well, there's no question there is a slowdown in China. I think a lot of that is somewhat inevitable, given various things that they are doing. But let me just emphasize if we can get a good deal for U.S. companies, this is a one of the single biggest opportunities. China has 1 billion 300 people. There's a tremendous growing middle class. This is an enormous opportunity for U.S. companies to participate in that growth.
MELISSA LEE: Is there a pain point though, I guess is another way of asking this, Mr. Secretary, in terms of how much pain the Chinese economy feels because of the ongoing trade negotiations and how much pain you see the U.S. economy suffering because of a China slowdown?
STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well, I don't see the U.S. economy suffering a slowdown at this point at all. Matter of fact, the outlook is very strong. I was with a group of CEOs yesterday. They continue to have a strong outlook on U.S. business. I think we've made a lot of progress already on trade. And I think the outlook for the economy this year is quite strong. Matter of fact, the U.S. is outperforming the rest of the world. And we continue to see a lot of capital coming into the U.S., creating more U.S. Jobs, building U.S. factories. So we're quite pleased with that.
BRIAN SULLIVAN: How much do you watch the stock market, Mr. Treasury Secretary?
STEVEN MNUCHIN: I've always watched the stock market a lot. I think, you know, I've been in the investment business since I graduated from Yale. And I've tended to watch the stock market every day since then.
BRIAN SULLIVAN: I mean, so we've had a pretty good start to 2019. Do you view the equity market's rebound from December as a positive sign about the economy? Do you find optimism in the fact that people have come back into the markets after what was a December to forget?
STEVEN MNUCHIN: I do, indeed. And you know, my comments in December were that I thought there was a real disconnect between what was going on in the economy and what was going on in the markets from everything that we were hearing from CEOs and business leaders around the U.S. But as I've commented before, markets are never efficient. So you usually do see markets moving in both directions. Corrections are a healthy process. We encouraged people to be long-term investors and I continue to think over the long-term, the U.S. market is one of the most attractive places to put capital in the world.
MIKE SANTOLI: Mr. Secretary, obviously the President addressed his border security objectives last night in his speech. And of course there's a committee trying to come to some kind of a deal to keep the government open right here. Can you give us any insight into what the state of those negotiations are? Do you think there will be another government shutdown?
STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well, the President has been very clear on border security. And border security is a whole range of different issues that he's focused on, which I think are very important to everybody. One of those pieces is a physical barrier. I think that we already have physical barriers. I'm very hopeful that the Republicans and the Democrats will reach a compromise. These are important issues. Democrats have supported physical barriers in the past. I don't know why they wouldn't do that now. I think there's a compromise deal to do and I hope they can deliver that to the President.
MELISSA LEE: You had a dinner that was reported about not too long ago, Mr. Secretary. It was a dinner with the President, the Fed Chair, as well as the Fed Vice Chair. Has the President expressed to you a change in opinion how Jerome Powell is doing?
STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well, I think it was a productive dinner on Monday night. We had talked about the potential for the Fed Chair to meet the President. This is something that's occurred in the past. I extended that invitation to Jay Powell on Friday at the request of the President. And we had a very casual dinner up in the residence. I think it was quite productive. Chairman Powell gave the President an overview of the economy and what he was seeing, which was quite strong and consistent with his public comments. And the President was quite engaged. We talked about everything from the economy to the golf match with Tiger and Jack to the Super Bowl. We covered a wide range. It was a -- I think a terrific meeting for them to get to see each other. They had not met since Jay Powell was put into office. So I think it was a productive meeting.
MELISSA LEE: Was there any acknowledgment of the pivot that the Fed Chair has made in terms of his language and his message to the markets between October 3rd, or even the end of December, to the beginning of January. There was a market pivot in terms of the Fed language and how it views future rate hikes and its balance sheet.
STEVEN MNUCHIN: The Fed Chair was very consistent in what he said to the President with what he's been saying publically in his press conferences. I think that the Fed Chair has very clear in looking at the economy and the Fed being clear that they have lots of different tools. And it's their job to focus on the growth of the economy. Right now inflation is quite low, which is a very, very good thing. So, again, I thought it was a very productive meeting. It was a casual meeting. And we enjoyed a wide range of topics with the President up in the residence.
MELISSA LEE: Was there a 'thank you' from the President to the Fed Chair? ""Thank you, Mr. Fed Chair, for being easier now on rates""?
STEVEN MNUCHIN: No, there was not a 'thank you.' There was a 'thank you' for coming for dinner in both directions. And in very good conversations.
BRIAN SULLIVAN: How do you guys walk that line? You know the line, right? I mean, it's supposed to be an apolitical office, and I understand, but there's questions you probably have for the Fed Chair, they might have for the White House or the Treasury Secretary. Are there preset parameters when you go in? Don't talk How do you guys walk that fine line? Because I'm sure the President just knowing his personality would like to say, to Melissa's point: you going to raise rates again this year?
STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well, I meet with Jay Powell every week. We have a very productive relationship. This has been a relationship that other Treasury Secretaries and Fed Chairs have had for a long period of time. We talk about a wide range of issues every week; everything from the U.S. economy, international economies, regulatory issues, I update the Fed on everything from our trade discussions to everything I'm hearing., The Fed with their Reserve Banks all over the U.S. have tremendous information, not only with the numbers but the information that they're hearing back. So we have very open two-way dialogues. As it relates to the dinner with the President, there were no preset parameters. I think Jay Powell is very clear that he wasn't going to say anything in private inconsistent with what he said publicly. Although we did have somewhat of a covert operation getting him into the White House so it didn't create speculation. Jay Powell put out a statement right after the meeting. We weren't trying to hide this. And, you know, again, it's something we'll contemplate again in the future. It's consistent with there have been meetings between Presidents and Fed Chairs in the past.
BRIAN SULLIVAN: Did he have like a wig and a mustache on?
STEVEN MNUCHIN: He did not. But I won't tell you.
BRIAN SULLIVAN: You said covert operations. I didn't see the helicopters. So I was just wondering how you snuck in the Fed Chair?
MELISSA LEE: Well, they did it. That's for sure. Mr. Secretary, I want to ask you about middle tax cuts. It was not mentioned in the State of the Union address last night. Are they on the agenda still?
STEVEN MNUCHIN: We'll look at everything. You know, we obviously have to now work with the Democrats on bipartisan issues. There's a long list of issues we'd like to work on. The President talked about infrastructure. That's something he's talked about during the campaign. It's very important. This has been important to Democrats in the past. I hope we can do something. Housing reform is something that I am very focused on. Chairman Crapo put out an outline last week, so I'm encouraged that the Senate will take this up with us. We obviously have the debt limit my position is clear. We need to raise the debt limit. That's something we're going to be very focused on. So there are a lot of issues that I think we can get bipartisan support on.
BRIAN SULLIVAN: Yeah, can you give us more clues as to infrastructure, Mr. Treasury Secretary? I mean this is a bipartisan issue I've been down to D.C. I've done meetings with Congressmen and women where we've talked about it. You've got DeFazio in Oregon. You've got some of the Pennsylvanians who are on board of this. Both bipartisan support. The issue seems to be funding. How do you do it? Is it through a raise of the gas tax? Is it through just another form of stimulus? Is it through a big just spending package? Where do we stand with that infrastructure bill? And how do you believe is the best way to pay for anything that we might do?
STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well, the President has been consistent that infrastructure is very important. You heard him talk about it last night in the speech. He's a builder and he wants to build. And we'd like to have a trillion-dollar package. That doesn't necessarily mean that it will cost a trillion dollars. That's not my expectation. I think the cost will be substantially less. There are many ways to have this paid for. There's also many ways of leveraging other money whether it's state's money or other money that can be spent on infrastructure. And we look forward to sitting down with the Democrats and the Republicans in Congress and having a bipartisan solution to pass an infrastructure bill.
BRIAN SULLIVAN: Yeah, quickly, a lot of hedge funds will care about this question. What's the status of GSE reform? Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac. Where do we stand?
STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well, this is something that is important to us. We want to have GSE reform but we also want to have more broadly housing reform. We'll look at FHA. We want to make sure if we fix the GSEs, we don't end up with too much risk at FHA on the government balance sheet with their market share increasing. As I've said before, our preference is to do something with Congress on a bipartisan basis. If that doesn't work, we do have administrative tools that we can make moves in housing. And we're looking at all of our options.
MELISSA LEE: Mr. Secretary, last question. How do you feel about what seems to be a war on capitalism going on particularly on the part of Democrats? The new candidates, but also a proposal from Senator Schumer and Sanders effectively saying that corporations shouldn't just have the ability to issue share buybacks and raise dividends whenever they want to. There should be strings attached.
STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well, I was especially surprised Senator Schumer attached his name to that article. Senator Schumer has been close to the financial markets for a long period of time in New York where it's a very important area. Companies need to be able to allocate capital. That's something that is important to the growth of the U.S. economy. Share buybacks are just one of the tools of returning capital. Dividends are another tool. And it's a fundamental premise that if companies can't invest the capital productively, they'll return it to shareholders. That gives shareholders the right to invest in other areas. So we don't believe in a centralized planned economy where the government puts restraints on it. Having said that, I think the issue -- some of the issues that were in that about worker training is something that this administration believes in very much. But we want to work with companies on these issues. We're not looking for centralized planning out of Congress to allocate capital.
MELISSA LEE: Mr. Secretary, thank you so much for your time this morning. We really appreciate it. Always good to speak with you.
STEVEN MNUCHIN: Thank you.
MELISSA LEE: Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary.

276,"Facing a wave of opposition, Amazon reconsiders New York headquarters site, two officials say","Once hailed as an economic triumph, the project in Queens now faces withering criticism from some politicians and advocacy groups",https://business.financialpost.com/technology/facing-opposition-amazon-reconsiders-ny-headquarters-site-two-officials-say,"{'id': 'financial-post', 'name': 'Financial Post'}",2019-02-08T18:58:08Z,"Amazon.com is reconsidering its plan to bring 25,000 jobs to a new campus in New York City following a wave of opposition from local politicians, according to two people familiar with the company’s thinking.
The company has not leased or purchased office space for the project, making it easy to withdraw its commitment. Unlike in Virginia — where elected leaders quickly passed an incentive package for a separate headquarters facility — final approval from New York state is not expected until 2020.
Tennessee officials have also embraced Amazon’s plans to bring 5,000 jobs to Nashville, which this week approved US$15.2 million in road, sewer and other improvements related to that project.
Amazon executives have had internal discussions recently to reassess the situation in New York and explore alternatives, said the two people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly about the company’s perspective.
“The question is whether it’s worth it if the politicians in New York don’t want the project, especially with how people in Virginia and Nashville have been so welcoming,” said one person familiar with the company’s plans.
Hailed as an economic triumph when it was announced by Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, both Democrats, the project in the Long Island City neighbourhood of Queens now faces withering criticism from some politicians and advocacy groups appalled at the prospect of giving giant subsidies to the world’s most valuable company, led by its richest man. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos also owns The Washington Post.)
In the past two weeks, the state Senate nominated an outspoken Amazon critic to a board where he could potentially veto the deal. City Council members for the second time aggressively challenged company executives at a hearing where activists booed and unfurled anti-Amazon banners.
Key officials, including freshman U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., whose district borders the proposed Amazon site, have rallied against the project. And opponents went door-to-door to warn people in Queens of looming rent hikes and displacement, much as Seattle experienced during the company’s explosive growth there.

No specific plans to abandon New York have been made. And it is possible that Amazon would try to use a threat to withdraw to put pressure on New York officials. But with a meeting of the state’s Public Authorities Control Board and a third City Council hearing expected later this month, Amazon executives may be reaching an inflection point, the people said.
“I think now is the time for Amazon to make a decision because it has to start hiring,” said one person. “At some point, the project starts to fall behind.”
The resistance in New York contrasts with the warm welcome Amazon has received in Virginia, where Gov. Ralph Northam, D, signed a law on Tuesday authorizing up to US$750 million in state subsidies for the Arlington headquarters.
Northam and Virginia’s other top two state officials, Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax and Attorney General Mark Herring, all Democrats, have been engulfed in recent days by scandals involving years-old behaviour. But the two people familiar with Amazon’s plans said company leadership is not concerned those controversies will hamper their project.
It’s unclear what Amazon might consider as a Plan B if the New York project falls through. It could forgo the incentive package and hire employees on a smaller scale, as competitors including Google are already doing. Or Amazon could search for another jurisdiction to get some or all of the jobs originally slated for New York.
“We always welcome more great jobs to the commonwealth,” said Stephen Moret, chief executive of the Virginia Economic Development Partnership and the state’s top Amazon negotiator.
Amazon has hired a lobbying firm and a public relations firm in New York and recently advertised for a “senior community affairs manager” to “focus on developing a positive partnership with local stakeholders, community groups and nonprofits.”
Asked to comment on the possibility that the New York deal might founder, Amazon spokeswoman Jodi Seth said: “We’re focused on engaging with our new neighbours — small business owners, educators, and community leaders. Whether it’s building a pipeline of local jobs through workforce training or funding computer science classes for thousands of New York City students, we are working hard to demonstrate what kind of neighbour we will be.”

New York state and city officials have played down the chances that the deal will fall through. They pointed to opinion polls showing strong public support for the project and said Cuomo and de Blasio will fight hard for it.
“The Amazon transaction was probably the greatest economic transaction in 50 years in this state,” Cuomo said in a recent radio interview. “We don’t get a business to come with 25,000 jobs anymore. I spend hours and days trying to get 100 jobs, 200 jobs.”
But the resistance is well organized and energetic, based in unions and community groups. In addition to Ocasio-Cortez, opponents include City Council Speaker Corey Johnson, Deputy Leader of the City Council James Van Bramer and state Sen. Michael Gianaris, who is deputy majority leader in the Senate.
Some officials who previously supported luring Amazon to the city have changed their position, partly because they were unhappy that the deal was structured to bypass City Council approval. Amazon is eligible for up to US$1.3 billion in subsidies from two city programs, in addition to the state package and other incentives.

New York governor Andrew Cuomo
In a significant boost for Amazon opponents, the Senate this week nominated Gianaris to the Public Authorities Control Board, where he could effectively veto the project. Cuomo has not said whether he will accept Gianaris’s nomination, but the Senate’s action signalled that the governor and legislature will be at odds over the deal.
Gianaris and other critics portray the New York struggle as a national test for populist forces confronting big companies’ influence, and for the contest within the Democratic Party between its grass-roots and business-friendly wings.
“We are dealing with an era of unprecedented corporate power in this country,” Gianaris said. “This Amazon deal represents a tipping point that is going to set the stage for what this country is going to be going forward.”
Amazon surprised the nation in November by announcing that it would split its much-publicized second headquarters between Arlington, Virginia, and Long Island City, with employees at each site earning an average of more than US$150,000 a year. Initially, the company said it planned a single location with all 50,000 jobs.
The divergent reactions in New York and Virginia arise from political and economic differences between the two, according to officials and analysts in both locations.
New York is a pro-labour city, whereas Virginia is a right-to-work state where employees cannot be obliged to join a union as a condition of employment.
Amazon has opposed attempts to unionize its workforce and said it would do the same in New York. “What Amazon is looking to do is come in and change the values of our city,” said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.

New York also is straining from the effects of rapid economic growth, whereas Arlington is eager to attract investment to Crystal City to offset the loss of thousands of federal government jobs there in a Pentagon reorganization that began in 2005.
The community around Long Island City is home to legions of grass-roots organizations that were already unhappy about gentrification and warn that Amazon’s arrival would further raise housing prices. Some also fault Amazon for selling facial-recognition technology to law enforcement agencies and partnering with companies that work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The activists have occupied an Amazon store in Manhattan, marched in Albany and demonstrated at the office of Assemblywoman Catherine T. Nolan (D-Queens), who supports the deal.
“The geography in New York has brought together a lot of threads of activism who were really ready to react to this kind of announcement and were particularly outraged,” said Deborah Axt, co-executive director of Make the Road, an organization of low-income immigrants and communities of colour.
Northern Virginia, Axt said, does “not have quite the pool of amazing champions ready to jump into the fray as we’re fortunate to have here in New York.”

Amazon supporters are aghast that local politicians— including Gianaris and Van Bramer — have turned against the company.
“Everyone in local government has said for years that we need to emphasize outer borough commercial development and that we want tech jobs in Long Island City,” said Stephanie Báez, a spokeswoman for the New York City Economic Development Corp. “But now we are seeing a few of the same local politicians abruptly flip-flopping in reaction to a small and well-organized group of people.”
In Virginia, almost all state and local leaders support the arrival of Amazon, despite opposition by several progressive groups — Tenants and Workers United, Our Revolution Arlington and some members of Indivisible Arlington — that have staged small protests at community meetings.
The Arlington County Board is putting final touches on a proposed US$23 million local incentives package, which it is expected to approve in March or later.
“Most people think this is a great opportunity,” Board Chair Christian Dorsey, D, said.
The board is pressuring Amazon to sign a project labour agreement that ensures a living wage, proper job classifications and safety standards for all those employed by construction contractors and subcontractors.
“They have emphatically not promised anything,” board member Erik Gutshall, D, said. “But I didn’t get the sense that any of those things was a non-starter.”
Residents of the neighbourhoods around the Arlington site worry about rent increases, spiking property taxes and paralyzing traffic. But neither they nor the progressive groups lobbying against the company appears to have enough political clout to block the deal.
In New York, critics are hoping that Amazon will tire of devoting time and money to fighting a battle it didn’t expect.
“The way these fights work, you push on each and every little thing,” Van Bramer said.
That approach was sure to worry Amazon, whose vice president for policy, Brian Huseman, told the recent City Council hearing, “We want to invest in a community that wants us.”"

Trump may also tout defense spending, and he may mention progress on trade talks with China after meetings last week in Washington.
""I suppose he could talk harshly about prescription drug prices. That would be a worthwhile angle to look at,"" said Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investment. ""That would probably be number one in terms of some kind of headline risk.""
Senate Republicans, in fact, announced Wednesday that they have called executives from seven pharmaceutical companies to testify Feb. 26 about pricing practices before the Senate Finance Committee. Senators Ron Wyden and Chuck Grassley sent letters Monday to AbbVie, AstraZeneca,Bristol-Myers Squibb,Merck,Pfizer, Sanofi and Johnson and Johnson
""[Drug pricing] is an easy one. He'll say, 'we'll get bipartisan support for this, and it's good for America.' That's always a popular political football, and he could mention infrastructure, and that tends to put a pop in engineering and construction stocks,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.
Hogan said in addition to big pharma, providers and insurers like CVS Healthcare and United Health could be affected by an effort to rein in pricing.
Trump is also expected to push spending on infrastructure, which Democrats have supported in theory in the past but it could be difficult to get an agreement on a large spending plan because of the funding.
""It is likely President Trump will push an infrastructure bill at the State of the Union this week and Democrats will probably offer their large package paid for with tax increases that are unlikely to pass the Senate,"" notes Dan Clifton, head of policy research at Strategas Research.
Clifton points out that there has been talk of a bipartisan bill, which would be good for stocks, but it's unlikely to make it through, unless Trump agrees to raise the gasoline tax or corporate tax rate.
""Rather, we would anticipate a small amount of infrastructure funding to be included as part of the sequestration spending deal. We expect this to be $20-$30bn for a couple of years, thereby making the number look small. This funding level will move the needle on stocks levered to federal infrastructure spending, but it will not be a macro event,"" Clifton wrote in a note.
Strategas has created an index from infrastructure names, like Fluor, Jacobs Engineering, Granite Construction, Griffon Corp, Dycom, and Vulcan Materials. It has picked up slightly recently but has mostly traded lower after surging on Trump's election. Trump speaks to to the nation at 9 p.m. ET.
""He'll be supporting a very vigorous defense budget. It looks like he will not give the Pentagon a hair cut. He'll give everyone else a hair cut,"" Valliere said. Defense stocks have already benefited from Trump with the ishares U.S. Aerospace and Defense ETF, up 12.5 percent in January, its best month since April, 2009.
If Trump talks up a potential trade peace with, John Davi, Astoria Portfolio Advisors CIO, says investors may want to look iShares MSCI China ETF MCHI. While not nearly as large as iShares Chinese large cap FXI, the ETF gives investors exposure to Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu. .
Hogan said investors could also look at U.S. stocks with exposure to China, like Apple and Caterpillar.
Strategas created an index of companies with large Chinese revenue exposure. The index is doing better lately after sliding through the last year.

Gene therapy and gene editing have taken the life sciences by storm in the past few years. We’ve seen the approvals of treatments that re-engineer patients’ cells to fight cancer and shocking claims of gene-edited babies abroad; dozens of biotechs continue to experiment with technologies such as CRISPR and “gene silencing,” techniques which could (theoretically) curb a multitude of diseases, from rare inherited disorders to cancers.
But the sector had a dour day as a pair of early-stage studies came up short. Sangamo Therapeutics stock sank 31% in Thursday trading on interim data for gene-editing techniques to treat the rare disorders MPS I and II.
It’s a particularly unfortunate setback since the news wasn’t all bad. The underlying technology actually did appear to work on some level – just not nearly enough to produce a meaningful clinical benefit for patients at this point, according to CEO Sandy Macrae.
In another part of the sector, Solid Biosciences’ gene therapy treatment for the devastating movement disorder Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) also appeared to fall short, absolutely devastating the small biotech’s stock, which fell 68%.
Again, these are early-stage results. But it goes to show just how fraught the drug making business can be, even in an era of pioneering treatments.

div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
The actively managed ""ARK Fintech Innovation ETF,"" will trade under the ticker ""ARKF"" and includes public companies that could use technology to bypass incumbent financial players by making things faster and cheaper, the company said. This is the firm's seventh ETF since launching in 2014.
The idea for a fintech ETF had been on the New York-based firm's road-map for a few years, CEO Catherine Wood told CNBC. But ARK's Japanese partner Nikko Asset Management saw the rapid growth in mobile payments in Asia, and asked if they could launch earlier than planned.
""China is really showing us the way they didn't have the older financial infrastructure so they could leapfrog us,"" said Wood. ""That business is spreading like wildfire."" 
ARK has $6.5 billion assets under management. 
She pointed to the ubiquity of giants like Alibaba, parent company of Ant Financial, and Tencent in Asia, which are both in the ETF. Those and other companies in ARKF are looking to upend traditional institutions by offering ""better, cheaper, faster, and more novel and secure"" services, according to Wood.
The ETF spans across three areas of technology. The first is ""mobile value transfer devices,"" or anything that lets someone send money or pay through a phone. Square, the ETF's biggest holding, and PayPal focus on peer-to-peer payments and both leaders in the U.S. online payment realm and are ""nipping at the traditional big bank's heels,"" Wood said.
Another key area is blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin. Despite the nosedive in bitcoin prices, Wood is still bullish on the future of it and other cryptocurrencies. She pointed to the jump in volumes, and the amount of people sending and receiving bitcoin, despite falling prices. Square, for example, lets customers buy bitcoin through the Square Cash App, and its CEO Jack Dorsey has touted its potential. By embracing crypto, Wood said ""they are attracting a new breed of customer.""
Other names in the ETF include Amazon, the ""original fintech player,"" according to Wood, and Apple because of growth in Apple Pay.
The fund also focused on artificial intelligence, which is being used by start-ups to assess creditworthiness. Companies that don't use AI for lending, are positioned to lose out in the modern economy, according to Wood. Baidu, Zillow, and LendingTree are also included in the ETF."

Back on Christmas Eve, just three stocks of the Nasdaq 100 were trading above their 50-day moving average. Now, 93 are above the short-term trend line, illustrating a massive bounce off lows. That's the biggest swing ever, 
according to NorthmanTrader's Sven Henrich
.
""Some of the sharpest rallies come in bear markets,"" Blue Line Futures's Bill Baruch said on CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Wednesday. ""Where we are right now, we are hitting a bit of an inflection point.""
The Nasdaq 100 broke above its 50-day moving average in mid-January, consolidated through last week, and is now breaking out again, says Baruch.
""On top of that, you're aligned with the 200-day moving average, 7,050 to 7,060. There's a tremendous amount of resistance up there. It tells me that this range, this rally has been extended and it's time for it to come in,"" said Baruch.
The Nasdaq 100, an index that includes Apple and Amazon, is trading just below its 200-day moving average. It has not traded firmly above that long-term trend line since October. However, it has rallied 19 percent off its December lows.
""What would convince me that this is not just a bear market rally would be a pullback of roughly 5 percent, something healthy where this market can come back a little bit and people don't panic and then it can go back higher,"" Baruch said. ""I want to see that play out and then I think we can continue higher in a path similar to last year.""
Fundamentally, a global economic decline has to slow and then stabilize before BK Asset Management's Boris Schlossberg gets bullish on the markets again.
""You're seeing some pretty serious material slowdowns,"" Schlossberg told ""Trading Nation"" on Wednesday. ""The really one big economic thing I'm going to be looking at in Q2 is global PMI [Purchasing Managers' Index]. If global PMI starts to stabilize, if all those factors start to finally show sequential growth, then yes, you have a legitimate case for further upside. Otherwise it's very much a bear market rally and will peter out.""
Global economic growth slowed close to its lowest level in 2½ years in January, according to the JPMorgan Global Composite PMI. Both growth in manufacturing and services activity decelerated.
""They need to see at very minimum a stabilization in order for us to have some confidence that this rally is going to be real,"" Schlossberg added."

A confession: Im one of those misfits who watches the Super Bowl as much for the ads as for the football. Thats partly because I enjoy the great clash of creative talent competing to keep viewers in their seats during timeouts. Who can ever wipe from their brain the image of Betty White being tackled in a mud pit? (For a look at the best 25 Super Bowl ads of all time, check here.)
But I also like the ads because seeing who is willing to spend over $4 million for a 30-second spot says something broader about the state of business and the economy. Apples iconic 1984 ad signaled the beginning of an era. MicroStrategys 2000 ad signaled the end of another.
So what did we learn in last nights contest? There was an excess of robots and voice assistants…but none rose above the rest. The robo-baby was creepy beyond belief; the advertiser can only hope no one remembers who they were, although I do. And Amazon’s Alexa ad made me want to unplug my Echo.
Top prize went to the NFL, whose 100th anniversary dinner turned into all-star melee. Given the leagues PR problems, they should get credit for creating such an uninhibited romp.
No. 2 was the Hyundai elevator commercial, starring Jason Bateman, which made me want to go out and buy one.
Best tug-on-your-heartstrings was a Google ad: How are you? Thank you and I love you are apparently the most translated phrases.
And best celebrity ad? Bublys ad with a confused Michael Buble.
Honorable mention goes to Expensify (Who knew an expense accounting app could compete for Super Bowl gold?); Bud Light, which teamed up with Game of Thrones for an epic ad series (but do Bud Light drinkers really care that their beer isnt made with corn syrup?); and Serena Williams (although when the ad was over, I still didnt know what Bumble was.).

283,Jeff Bezos may now face an even bigger battle: Convincing investors extortion and embarrassing photos won’t distract him,The world's wealthiest man stunned the industry last night when he accused the National Enquirer of trying to blackmail him,https://business.financialpost.com/technology/jeff-bezos-extortion-and-embarrassing-pics-wont-distract-me,"{'id': 'financial-post', 'name': 'Financial Post'}",2019-02-08T13:15:46Z,"Jeff Bezos pre-empting the National Enquirer by laying bare embarrassing personal details may have been the easier task. Now the world’s wealthiest man needs to convince investors that locking horns with a powerful American media organization won’t end up hurting Amazon.com Inc. itself.
Bezos, Amazon’s single largest shareholder, stunned the industry Thursday night when he accused the Enquirer of trying to blackmail him, publishing tense exchanges with the magazine that included prurient details of his relationship with former TV anchor Lauren Sanchez. The saga now threatens to snowball, exerting even more pressure on a billionaire who already oversees the biggest online retailer, a space exploration company and a leading national news outlet.
Bezos’ revelation steps up a war of words with a confidant of U.S. President Donald Trump, who’s been critical of Amazon and its founder. When the Enquirer, owned by American Media Inc., published an expose on Bezos’s relationship with Sanchez, he hired investigator Gavin de Becker to find out if the story was politically motivated. In addition to furthering that suggestion — and how it’s possibly linked to the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi — Bezos made efforts in Thursday’s write-up to cement another narrative: he’s focused.
“I asked him (de Becker) to prioritize protecting my time since I have other things I prefer to work on and to proceed with whatever budget he needed to pursue the facts in this matter,” Bezos wrote in the post.

Bezos’s move to scoop the Enquirer on its own story effectively neutralized any leverage the magazine had over him. But the longer the fight plays out in public, the bigger the threat that Bezos is perceived as distracted, said David Larcker, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business who’s researched the impact of CEO controversies on companies.
“What you don’t want to have happen is all of this lingering stuff that bleeds itself out and it just takes on a life of its own,” said Larcker, who doesn’t anticipate the controversy hurting Amazon sales at this point. “Where you worry about it is what’s happening in the executive suite. What time is it taking? Is it adding stress?”
The first whiff of controversy came Jan. 9 when Bezos posted a statement on Twitter, signed by him and his wife of 25 years, MacKenzie, announcing plans to divorce. Hours later, the first Enquirer story on his extra-marital relationship with Sanchez posted online. Bezos on Thursday said the magazine later threatened to release more details — including selfies with partial nudity — if he didn’t agree to stop his ongoing investigation into the publication’s motives.
Bezos accused the Enquirer and its publisher David Pecker, a Trump ally, of extortion in a bid to end that probe. Muddying the situation further, Bezos owns the Washington Post, which has written critical stories about Trump. Khashoggi was a columnist for the Post.
Bezos owns a stake of about 16 per cent in Amazon. A company spokesman has said the CEO and founder remains “focused and engaged in all aspects of Amazon.” Bezos and company spokespeople haven’t addressed whether he will accelerate his periodic sales of Amazon shares, or whether the divorce will otherwise affect his holding.
For now, investors have shrugged off news of his personal life as unimportant to the value of the company, which posted revenue of US$233 billion last year and a record-breaking holiday season. Now that Bezos has twice jumped in front of embarrassing news, the challenge is in maintaining the perception he can focus on his company’s growth.
“Bezos is that extraordinary, and Amazon is that extraordinary, that he can bring down a bully,” said Davia Temin, founder of the New York based crisis-consultant Temin and Co. “He’s got the courage, and the position as the richest man in the United States, and I think his courage in standing up to the extortion is going to outweigh the details behind the extortion.”

Amazon’s board has ten members, four of whom are women and Brewer will be the second black female director. Before joining Starbucks in 2017, she was CEO of Sam’s Club.
Last year a group of shareholder-employees challenged Amazon to adopt the so-called “Rooney rule” to ensure that it interviewed at least one woman or racial minority for each open board position. After brief resistance amidst additional pressure from some Congressional caucuses, the company adopted the rule in May.
One employee on an email chain at the time of the challenge last year noted that Amazon was last among its peers for boardroom diversity. Brewer will be on the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee so she will be in a position to direct change both at her own level and among the company’s executives.
“We were already actively recruiting Ms. Brewer when our corporate governance guidelines were amended last year, an Amazon spokesperson told Recode.

In a suit filed Thursday in federal court in the Southern District of New York seeking more than $68 million in damages, Mr. Allen said Amazon backed out of his deal last June after an old accusation that the director and actor had molested his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow in 1992 resurfaced as the #MeToo movement was gathering steam.
Amazon has tried to excuse its action by referencing a 25-year-old baseless allegation against Mr. Allen, but that allegation was already well-known to Amazon (and the public) before Amazon entered into four separate deals with Mr. Allenand in any event, it does not provide a basis for Amazon to terminate the contract, the suit said.
In recent years, Ms. Farrow has become more vocal about her accusation against Mr. Allen and in a 2014 New York Times piece criticized those who have worked with him. Since her column and a 2018 television interview with Ms. Farrow on CBS This Morning detailing the allegation, some actors and actresses have publicly expressed remorse about appearing in Mr. Allens movies.

""If you look at the stock's more than doubling in value, clearly one could argue he's underpaid relative to the wealth creation he's been able to do in the stock,"" said Brent Bracelin, managing director at KeyBanc Capital Markets. 
""They have been able to transform one of the legacy client-server models, and they're now becoming the leader in cloud across IaaS [infrastructure as a service] and SaaS [software as a service], and he's done it, yet, look at his comp.""
Microsoft's perception has improved in Silicon Valley, too.
When Nadella took the helm, Steve Herrod, a former VMware executive and now managing director at venture capital firm General Catalyst Partners, didn't have any Microsoft apps on his phone. Now Herrod has nine Microsoft apps on his phone, and he believes Microsoft has the best mobile email app: Outlook.
One start-up Herrod invested in, Impira, chose Microsoft's Azure cloud because the team thought Microsoft's cloud-based artificial intelligence capability was better than what was available from the Amazon and Google clouds, Herrod said.
""From all perspectives, he's done an outstanding job, and a top-five CEO should have a commensurate package,"" Herrod said of Nadella.
The company is more open and flexible now, and assets like LinkedIn and GitHub have given Microsoft meaningful data, said Gordon Ritter, founder and general partner of venture firm Emergence Capital.
""If I were on the board of Microsoft, I would say, 'Did he really look at things differently than those that came before and actually interrupt the natural processes that were going on?' And my answer is yes, compared to the interruptions Tim Cook did do or didn't do. I would say he interrupted and changed the course of Microsoft in fundamental way.""
Given that, Ritter said Nadella would be deserving of some kind of additional grant.
""I think everybody feels good about Satya as CEO of the company -- Bill and Steve and the company's board of directors,"" Silverberg said. ""They should thank their lucky stars that that's who they hired as CEO.""

290,How the shadow of the financial crisis shaped this portfolio manager’s strategy to insulate investors,"At 21, Ryan Marr watched first-hand the bottom fall out of the market. A decade later he says he has a way to insulate investors from that carnage",https://business.financialpost.com/investing/investing-pro/ryan-marr,"{'id': 'financial-post', 'name': 'Financial Post'}",2019-02-06T11:00:32Z,"Ryan MarrCole Burston for National Post
In 2008, Ryan Marr felt invincible.
At 21, as a co-op student from Wilfrid Laurier University, he was handling millions of dollars in investments for Gluskin Sheff and Associates, a Toronto-based firm that had close to $4 billion in assets at the time.
For months, he felt he could do no wrong. His stock picks — a mix of REITs, Canadian and U.S. banks and tech companies such as Miranda Technologies and Evertz Technologies Ltd. — were all making significant gains. Investing was easy, he thought, and he could make a career of it.
When global markets were struck down by the financial crisis that year, Marr remembers standing in front of a computer screen that displayed the market’s real-time impact on the firm’s investments and seeing that they had lost more than $240 million in one day. That number only grew as the crisis deepened.
If the market were going up 10%, they find it hard to understand, but when the markets go down 10%, they all understand
“I think I was so naive to the implications of losing that much money so quickly that I was more fascinated with the magnitude of the losses,” Marr, now 32, said from a conference room in his downtown Toronto office, which sits directly above a toy store.
“You could be the best stock picker in the world, but when markets fall, you’re going to lose money and there needs to be a portfolio management decision that helps protect against those losses,” he added.
Marr was still getting acquainted to Bay Street when he saw his first investments tumble in the most brutal market crash since the Great Depression. Now a seasoned investor, the experience appears to have moulded his market strategies.
Last year, Marr’s new firm, Waypoint Investment Partners, earned its clients a 6.2 per cent return in segregated accounts. By comparison, the S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index lost close to 12 per cent. Most of those losses came in a brutal final quarter, but in that time, Waypoint’s defensive portfolios managed to remain around even.
The firm is now looking to raise $500 million for a new hedge fund — the All-Weather Portfolio —  devoted to Marr’s strategy, which attempts to insulate investors from massive downturns like the one he watched in awe as a co-op student.
Mainstream investors likely wouldn't recognize most of his picks, Marr admitted, because analysts don't cover them
Marr’s approach is two-pronged. He invests in high-dividend yielding Canadian-listed stocks that are outside the resource sector and deploy conservative balance sheets. Mainstream investors likely wouldn’t recognize most of his picks, Marr admitted, because analysts don’t cover them. There are only 110 stocks that fit his profile. Of these, he chooses to only focus on between 20 and 25 companies, rotating two or three out from the larger pool each year.
Marr then uses the dividends from these investments to buy put options, usually ranging between two to six months on Canadian-listed securities both inside and outside his portfolio and on indexes such as the S&amp;P/TSX60. Marr also writes some calls, but most of his emphasis is on downside protection.
The specific purchase decision is mostly based on pricing, he said, but he deploys a variety of puts ranging from at-the-money options to those with a strike price ten per cent below the current price. If the puts expire, he re-evaluates.
Should the market undergo a correction like it did at the end of 2018, the returns are safe, he said, because losses in the portfolio’s equities are offset by the returns from the puts. The strategy appears to be more well-suited for a market that is at the end of its natural cycle because when stocks are rising in a raging bull market, Marr is still buying put options.
If another investor with a basic equities strategy makes 10 per cent on their portfolio during this time, Marr would only make seven due to about three per cent of the returns going back to buying put options. The conversations Marr has with investors aren’t always the easiest. Not many are ready to give up a chunk of their returns for downside protection — until they see their investments plummet, that is.
“If the market were going up 10 per cent, they find it hard to understand, but when the markets go down 10 per cent, they all understand,” he said.
All it took for Marr to understand the same logic was one of the greatest market collapses in history.
Marr got his first job out of high school at Calloway Real Estate Investment Trust, now known as Smart Centres Real Estate Investment Trust, through a family connection. Working to pay his way through university, Marr was a summer intern but they let him make calls to put up collateral to receive funding for new projects. “I couldn’t believe how easy it was,” he said.
Securing $300 million was as simple as getting Merrill Lynch on the phone and sending over a list of properties that he believed were enough to collect that amount. “Next thing I knew, I was getting $300 million. I literally knew nothing,” he said.
During his next stop at Gluskin Sheff, where he’d stay for more than 10 years, Marr’s specialty quickly became investing in options. Working in long-short hedge funds, Marr began looking for an approach that didn’t involve shorting stocks in a low-interest-rates environment that made it difficult to reinvest the cash proceeds at high rates of return.
Options looked appealing because no one at Gluskin Sheff had really waded into that pool yet — firms were content to allow TD and BMO to dominate that market.
But the prices for buying put options were steadily declining and the feasibility of using them to hedge a portfolio grew more and more interesting. What Marr later learned was that others had developed the same idea as a way to look for additional yield that traditional fixed income portfolios weren’t providing. A “one-way trade” as he called it resulted in pushing the price of volatility down and making its appeal stretch market-wide.
While he paired his new options expertise with his fondness for high-dividend yielding stocks and began implementing the strategy for his personal investments, he never put it into practice at Gluskin Sheff. The reason, he said, is because the small-cap names he invests in “don’t necessarily have the scale to move the needle for a $9 billion asset management firm.” He didn’t even pitch the idea.
Marr preferred to leave the firm instead and see if he could make the strategy work on his own.
Perhaps his harshest criticism of the investment sector is one that’s constantly heard in Canada’s medical field: There are too many walk-in clinics and not enough family physicians or specialty clinics. Moving away from Gluskin Sheff would be akin to working in his own specialty clinic.
It didn’t take long for him to be recruited at Waypoint, which was then a multi-family office being run by another former Gluskin Sheff alum, the firm’s former chief investment officer, Bill Webb. Webb left Gluskin Sheff two years before Marr did, but the two stayed in touch, and in multiple phone calls, Marr would plant the seeds in Webb’s mind about a new strategy that combined volatility with high-dividend stocks.
Marr's portfolio scored two victories last year that any investor would envy
Marr joined Waypoint in late 2017 as a partner and portfolio manager and immediately began to implement his strategies. The first results were positive, he said, and it didn’t take long for the firm to begin drawing attention from outside the partners’ family members. The creation of a fund was the next step in the evolution.
Most of Waypoint’s investors are in an older demographic and are saving for retirement. The strategy works for these people, he said, because it allows them to compound returns while avoiding tremendous losses. The investor he cannot help is one that has a significant amount of capital in play and is searching for growth in a “Hail Mary” investment, he said.
And yet Marr’s portfolio scored two victories last year that any investor would envy.
Pure Industrial REIT was Marr’s play on Amazon.com Inc’s good fortunes. While the tech giant would have been an albatross in Marr’s portfolio, he still wanted exposure to the online retail scene. Thinking that the logical play was to invest in the warehouse space that companies such as Amazon would require, Marr’s faith in Pure Industrial was rewarded when it was bought in January for $3.8 billion by Blackstone Group LP, a New York investment firm. His second big win came when Brookfield Infrastructure acquired Enercare, an Ontario-based company that rented water heaters to home owners, in an October deal for $4.3 billion.
Each of those gains ended up contributing 2.5 per cent to his portfolio, he said.
As he prepares to begin investing in the All-Weather Portfolio this month, the newest stock atop Marr’s list is Sienna Senior Living Inc., a company that owns and operates nursing homes across Ontario. The stock lost 15 per cent between January and December 2018 but its 5.28 per cent dividend lessened the blow.
Based on its past performance, Marr also knows what he’s likely to get out of this investment considering the stock has not hovered above or below the $14-$19 range in four years. The future, however, appears to be brighter. The stock is his way of betting on waves of baby boomers retiring and heading into retirement homes and long-term care facilities. The sector currently offers about 430,000 beds, according to Marr, but as baby boomers start to move in, his projections have that number growing up to one million.  
Unlike his early days, these are now the types of investments that define his portfolio. The bets on risky technology companies are gone and in their place are stocks that should never leave him wondering how $100 million disappeared.
There are no recognizable names or exciting growth opportunities in his portfolio — and that’s how he likes it.
“Some people look at it as a bit boring — but boring is good for me,” he said."

292,The New York Times just proved that digital media is far from dead,"While digital-era stalwarts like BuzzFeed and Vice have announced layoffs, the New York Times' digital business booked $709 million in revenue last year and is on track to have 10 million paying subscribers by 2025.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/06/the-new-york-times-just-proved-that-digital-media-is-far-from-dead.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-06T19:12:00Z,"This hasn't been a good year so far for online publishers.
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
Digital media stalwarts Buzzfeed, Vice and VerizonMedia Group (which includes HuffPo and Yahoo) all recently announced major layoffs. New York Times columnist Farhad Manjoo was so upset about the BuzzFeed layoffs, he wrote that they were ""devastating to democracy."" He noted that these pure-play companies relied heavily on digital distribution platforms controlled by tech companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google, but that these companies ""have no economic incentive for symbiosis"" with the media providers, and instead can rely on user-generated content to attract audiences and advertisers.
Paradoxically, there's at least one company that's actually doing very well in the new digital media era: The New York Times.
On Wednesday, the Times announced Q4 2018 earnings that beat expectations, sending the company's stock up more than 12 percent.
The reason was not a resurgence in print. In fact, print ad revenues dropped 6.5 percent from 2017 to 2018, and total print subscription revenues were up only 3.4% for the year.
But the company's digital business is thriving.
The Times said it booked $709 million in digital revenue in 2018, bolstered primarily by 17.7% growth in digital subscription revenue for the year. The company added 265,000 digital subscribers during the quarter, for a total of 3.4 million total digital subscribers, up 27 percent from the end of 2017. It's well on its way to reaching its goal of $800 million in digital revenue by 2020, and 10 million digital subscribers by 2025.
A lot of this growth can be attributable to President Donald Trump, whose disdain for the media is well known. The Times saw a big bump in subscriptions after Trump's election, and its often-critical coverage of the president has found a devoted audience.
But there's a larger point at play here too. The Times was early to buck the business model of most pure-play digital media companies, which was to chase massive audiences by publishing free content that was optimized to go viral through social platforms like Facebook. This led to a race-to-the-bottom of listicles and slideshows and ""The one reason"" clickbait headlines. In the meantime, as fast as these publishers grew their audience, all of the ad revenue growth went to the biggest platform aggregators, mostly Facebook and Google.
The Times did cooperate with Facebook on some of its initiatives like Instant Articles, which reformatted articles to make them more attractive on Facebook, particularly its mobile site. And long-time media watchers may have noticed that the Times headlines are sometimes a little more risque and catchier than they used to be, a possible concession to the massive competition from online publishers.
But the company's digital business model has always been pretty straightforward: Publish journalism that people want to read, give them a taste for free and then ask them to pay for it.
So far, it seems to be working quite well. And not just at the Times Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post in 2013 and made a number of changes on the back-end, but also put up a strong paywall. In a 2017 speech, Bezos noted that every time the Post made the paywall stricter, more people paid.
""This industry spent 20 years teaching everyone in the world that news should be free. The truth is, readers are smarter than that. They know high-quality journalism is expensive to produce, and they are willing to pay for it, but you have to ask them. We've tightened our paywall, and every time we've tightened our paywall, subscriptions go up.""
Now, digital media publishers are racing to follow the lead of the Times and the Post, with everybody from Bloomberg to Business Insider to Conde Nast instituting paywalls. Consumers may soon reach the burnout point with paywalls, leading to an opportunity for the kind of bundled product that has been so successful for the pay-TV industry.
But the lesson for now is clear. People will pay for quality journalism, if you give them an opportunity.

293,One way to play momentum stocks without making a big bet on Alphabet,Alphabet earnings could make or break the many ETFs which house the stock. Here's one way to play high-momentum names without the downside risk.,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/04/one-way-to-play-momentum-stocks-without-making-a-big-bet-on-alphabet.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-04T20:10:00Z,"Alphabet is about to report earnings after the bell.

And given it's in a whopping 184 ETFs, including the largest holding in the communications sector ETF (XLC) with a 24 percent weighting, whichever way it moves will have a major impact on the market.
However, despite clawing back from December lows, the Google parent has underperformed the rest of the high-growth FANG names. Its nearly 9 percent advance in the year to date is equal to Amazon's gain and well below Facebook and Netflix's move of more than 28 percent.
For the investor looking for high-momentum exposure without any downside risk from Alphabet, John Davi, chief investment officer at Astoria Portfolio Advisors, said one ETF fits the bill.
""If you're trying to capture the risk characteristics of FANG stocks which are momentum-driven stocks, in my opinion, I would probably use something a little bit more diverse like MTUM, which is the momentum ETF,"" Davi said Monday on CNBC's ""ETF Edge."" ""Basically 46 percent of the MTUM is from the XLC ETF so it's another way to get exposure to that theme and you have a lot more diversification benefits.""
Amazon makes up the largest weighting at more than 5 percent, followed by Microsoft and Apple. The MTUM ETF also mixes in high-momentum players in other sectors, including health care's Pfizer and financial's Visa. Alphabet has not been a part of the ETF since April 2017.
That level of diversification shielded the MTUM ETF from the worst of the sell-offs in the back half of last year, Davi said.
""Since XLC has been around since July, it's down 10 percent. The MTUM is only down 3 percent so it's a way to kind of get a little bit more diversification and protect the downside,"" he explained.
The MTUM has not outpaced the XLC ETF so far this year as Facebook and Netflix rallies gave rise to big gains for the communications sector. The XLC is up 12 percent in 2019 compared with a 6 percent increase for the MTUM.
However, its dynamic holdings could turn MTUM's fortunes once again.
""MTUM also rebalances every six months so instead of always having Alphabet and Facebook and Netflix, it rotated and added some health-care exposure later on in the year, became a little bit more defensive,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA, Monday on ""ETF Edge."" ""You really need to look inside the portfolio on an ongoing basis, not just assume you know what's inside."""

Shortly after Amazon picked
 New York to host half of its HQ2, an architect’s group published a concept drawing of a giant fulfillment centre carving through the Manhattan skyline. Purposely provocative, the image carried a clear message: The city would be good for Amazon, but would Amazon be good for the city?

The only sensible response is that of course such massive inward investment — $1.4 billion in September alone — will be good for Toronto. It will directly create hundreds of well-paying jobs and also provide a substantial boost to our homegrown tech companies.
Some have voiced concerns that the arrival of deep-pocketed U.S. corporations will price our own startups out of the market for top talent, thereby slowing their growth and confining us to branch-plant operations for foreign companies. Others have painted these companies as a new generation of corporate raiders, who will do a smash-and-grab for our intellectual property.
The mistaken assumption underlying these worries is that innovation is a zero-sum game — that an engineer employed by Samsung or Google is irredeemably lost to the startup ecosystem. In reality, there are countless examples of workers who cycle through the corporate world, then go on to establish their own companies with upgraded skills and more experience: I was one of those people.
You see, talent is “borderless.” The best engineers and entrepreneurs will go wherever they need to go, find the best possible opportunities to build their skills, experience and ventures. And as always, the best always want to work with the best, build with the best and learn from the best. The arrival of big-name companies is a signal to the market that global companies can be built in Toronto. That will draw more talented workers and investors, particularly as competitors like the U.S. and U.K. become less welcoming to immigrants.
Yes, we need to be vigilant that we have safeguards in place for our data and intellectual property. But Toronto’s tech sector is having a moment on the world stage and we need to use it — not work against it — to accelerate the growth of made-in-Canada ventures. To do this, we need to do three things:
Leverage the arrival of big tech companies 
Toronto’s tech sector is connected and collaborative like few others. The best way to ensure that corporates bring more to this ecosystem than they take from it is by forging partnerships with them. Venture arms of big tech companies can be an important source of capital — Salesforce, for instance, is investing US$100 million in Canadian startups. They can also be vital customers and partners, enabling new technologies to be rapidly scaled on their platforms. We are already seeing the power of this approach in the financial industry, where nimble fintech startups are growing fast by building white-label technologies that integrate into the systems of large financial institutions around the world.
Connect ventures to sources of strategic global capital
The arrival of big-name tech companies has put Toronto firmly on the radar of investors. That will help close our venture capital gap with the U.S. — our ventures raise about half as much capital as theirs. But we also need to focus on the quality of that capital, especially as we are likely heading into choppier waters for the global economy. Our companies are export-driven, so we need investors who are internationally connected and can help them enter new markets. As well as continuing to draw global venture capitalists here, we should explore ways to make it easier for Canada’s enormous pension funds to invest in tech ventures while meeting their fiduciary responsibilities. Our pension funds are among the world’s smartest investors and bringing more of their talent and financial firepower to bear could rapidly accelerate growth of our innovative companies.
Focus on key sectors where we have strategic advantage
Canada’s inclusive approach to innovation is serving us well, but we have to be careful that we don’t spread ourselves too thin. We have to choose the sectors where we have a natural advantage and back those to the hilt. Our leadership in artificial intelligence is clearly a crown jewel — funding in that sector reached an all-time quarterly high of $169 million in Q2 2018 — but we also have natural advantages in clean technologies and health care. Our sweet spot might well come from combining these strengths. We are already seeing ventures emerge that use artificial intelligence to make clean technologies smarter and more efficient.
We should take pride in the fact that Toronto is a bonafide global centre of innovation. That’s why international corporations are setting up here. The arrival of big tech companies could lift all boats in our innovation ecosystem — we just have to take steps to ensure our ventures can ride the incoming tide.

295,How Much Are Babysitters Making Around the Country?,The national average for an hour of babysitting now stands at $16.75 per hour.,http://fortune.com/2019/02/01/babysitter-average-regional-salary-rates/,"{'id': 'fortune', 'name': 'Fortune'}",2019-02-01T17:42:16Z,"Babysitting the kid down the street pays a lot better than working at Walmart or McDonald’s.
A new study from UrbanSitter finds the national average for an hour of babysitting now stands at $16.75 per hour for one child and $19.26 per hour for two children. To put that in perspective, that’s more than twice the Federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour.
It’s also above the $9 per hour average at the retail giant and $8 per hour average for crew members at the fast food leader. (Of course, you’ll get more hours at either of those jobs.)
The study, which gathered data from 28,000 families around the country, found that in San Francisco, with its high cost of living, sitters made the most, averaging $18.75 per hour for one child and $21.30 per hour for two kids. Las Vegas had the least expensive average, $11.63 per hour for one child and $14.71 per hour for two kids.
Rates in other cities run a wide gamut:
Los Angeles $16.06 (1 child); $18.01 (2 children)
New York $17.30 (1 child); $20.85 (2 children)
Boston $16.90 (1 child); $18.84 (2 children)
Atlanta $13.17 (1 child); $15.75 (2 children)
Miami $12.67 (1 child); $16.38 (2 children)
Minneapolis $13.94 (1 child); $14.68 (2 children)
Babysitting is a growth field, it would seem. While some cities have seen price reductions in the past year, Urbansitter notes that average rates have increased 2% in the past year (last year’s average was $16.43) and 18% in the last five years. And 18% of parents hire a sitter at least once a month."

And Gary, Ind., along with the state, offered a $47 million incentive package in August 2018 to U.S. Steel, according to U.S. News and World Report.
The hope was that the $750 million the company would invest in modernizing a 112-year-old steel plant would preserve nearly 3,900 steelworker jobs. President Donald Trump’s steel tariffs made the move economically viable.
But as the incentive deal continues to be negotiated, it turns out that jobs may be lost and not kept, as Reuters reports.
U.S. Steel vice president Douglas Matthews told Reuters that “decreasing headcount over time” was more likely.
This makes the city of Garyinitially founded in 1906 by U.S. Steel and named for company co-founder Elbert Henry Garyis the latest to discover that tax subsidies have left a lengthy trail of unmet promises.
The Kauffman Foundation has found that incentives only tend to shift jobs between states, not create new ones, as CBS News reported.
University of Texas at Austin professor Nathan Jensen and PhD student Calvin Thrall, writing in The Conversation, discovered that announced deals frequently get renegotiated privately, cutting back on the jobs promises.
Boston, for instance, offered General Electric $25 million in tax breaks to relocate its corporate headquarters from Connecticut. But after the deal announcement, GE cut jobs in its Boston temporary office, though the troubled conglomerate is still promising to create 800 new jobs in the city by its 2024 deadline.
As Jensen separately wrote in the New York Times, incentives often take tax revenues away from other local needs like education. A report from the site Good Jobs First, which tracks subsidies and incentives to corporations, found that public schools across the country lost $1.8 billion in 2017 when funds were redirected to corporate subsidies.
Or there’s the example of the incentives offered to Amazon to open a major campus in New York City. Initially, some of the enticements were tax breaks for developing poor areas. Amazon said in late January that it would now decline those breaks.
Often, winning an incentive bid for business can mean losing."

So the board and the CEO decided to let Microsoft invest.,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/04/microsoft-invests-in-databricks-funding-at-2point7-billion-valuation.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-05T14:00:00Z,"Once upon a time, Silicon Valley start-ups were afraid of Microsoft, or scorned it as irrelevant.
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
That's changed under Satya Nadella, according to investor Ben Horowitz, whose firm Andreessen Horowitz just co-invested alongside Microsoft in Databricks, a start-up with software for processing large-scale data inpublic clouds.
Microsoft is ""truly an outstandingly good partner, which is really an amazing thing, just because if you go back to the '90s, Microsoft didn't have that reputation,"" Horowitz said.
In the old days, there were two things that made Microsoft difficult to partner with, Horowitz said. Anything the company did had to promote Windows. Also, he said, ""it was always scary to introduce a company to them [Microsoft] because it always felt like they were going to use information against you.""
In addition to changing the company's track record there, Nadella has also rebuilt the company's bench of product leaders after it emptied out under Ballmer, Horowitz said.
The relationship between Databricks and Microsoft dates to 2016, when Horowitz sent an email about the company to Nadella.
Nadella grasped the importance of having data in the same place as the software that will process it, and his team understood how well it could handle lots of different kinds of data, Horowitz said.
""You have to just give him credit for seeing it,"" Horowitz said.
Microsoft employees then did the work to make sure that the Databricks software, which draws on the Apache Spark open-source project, works well with Azure, and got its salespeople prepared to sell the technology.
The resulting collaboration was one-of-a-kind -- Microsoft offers a cloud service with ""Databricks"" in the name, but Databricks is the one that's running it, said Databricks' CEO, Ali Ghodsi.
Sometime in the second half of 2018 -- Ghodsi wouldn't say exactly when -- he had dinner at Nadella's house. He came away as impressed as Horowitz.
""He said, 'As a leader, you need to create clarity.' I think he's created a lot of clarity at Microsoft,"" Ghodsi said of Nadella. ""He's really, really customer-obsessed, and he really believes in the cloud, and he's a great leader.""
Ghodsi and the Databricks board recognized what Microsoft had already contributed and decided to give Microsoft a chance to invest in the latest round, Horowitz said.
The new investment, which is an unspecified portion of a $250 million round, exemplifies Microsoft's increased focus on commercializing open-source software. In addition to making some of its technology compatible with the Linux operating system, which competes with Windows, Microsoft has also tapped other companies and made acquisitions in recent years to bolster its collection of developer tools that are compatible with open-source code.
Microsoft has previously partnered with open-source companies like Docker and Hortonworks in its efforts to compete with cloud market leader Amazon Web Services.
In January, Microsoft announced the acquisition of Citus Data, a company focusing on the PostgreSQL open-source database software, and in 2017 it bought the Deis team and technology, partly with an eye toward improving Azure's capabilities with software containers.
San Francisco-based Databricks claims more than 2,000 customers, including HP and Shell. The new round values the company at $2.7 billion. Coatue Management, Battery Ventures, Green Bay Ventures, Geodesic and New Enterprise Associates also participated in the new round alongside Microsoft and Andreessen Horowitz.

Carl Rodrigues recalls being thrilled in August 2017 to have a sitting prime minister visit him at a Toronto hotel to discuss the future of his burgeoning company.
Just one detail was different than what he was hoping for. The visiting prime minister was not Justin Trudeau, but Ireland’s Leo Varadkar, who made a point of making SOTI Inc. one of the few private-sector companies he visited during a summer trip to Canada.
SOTI had written to Trudeau seven months earlier, inviting him to attend the unveiling of its future headquarters in Mississauga, Ont., which will eventually support some 1,100 jobs focused on mobility and the Internet of Things technologies.
But Trudeau declined to visit the potentially important research facility, though he did find the time, in January 2018, to visit several foreign tech juggernauts in Silicon Valley, including Amazon.com Inc. chief executive Jeff Bezos.
Canadian executives roundly consider such mild snubs from the Trudeau government to be a familiar occurrence, saying it points to Ottawa’s ready embrace of foreign tech companies at the expense of domestic firms, making it hard for scrappy young tech firms to find the attention and affordable workers they need to grow to commercial scale.
Rodrigues, the founder and chief executive of SOTI, is broadly supportive of Ottawa’s efforts to spur innovation, but said there is an instinctual, and often contradictory, support of Canadian companies’ multinational rivals that could have real consequences for the country’s broader economy.
“While this government has been bending over backward to bring multinational companies to Canada, Canadian companies have been expanding internationally,” Rodrigues said.
Varadkar’s visit certainly appears to have yielded fruit for both SOTI and Ireland. In August 2018, SOTI announced it would spend roughly $30 million to build a branch office in Galway that would employ 150 people. The company is mulling further expansions in the country as it grows.
But industry insiders warn that the growth of multinational tech giants in Canada and the influence they wield over government policy, if left unchecked, could suffocate domestic firms on their home turf.
“It’s really these (Canadian) companies that are going to be the centre of the economy,” said Benjamin Bergen, executive director of the Council for Canadian Innovators (CCI). “If we don’t have big, successful tech companies, we’re going to find it hard to pay for the social programs that we as Canadians care about.”
CCI was founded in 2015 by Jim Balsillie, the former co-CEO of Research in Motion Ltd., which built BlackBerry into one of Canada’s few homegrown success stories. The council lobbies Ottawa to introduce policies it believes will allow the Canadian tech space to flourish, along with the roughly 100 executives it represents.
Much of CCI’s concern revolves around intellectual property rights.
In an increasingly digital economy, where data points are like the new oil barrels, IP rights are the lifeblood of any tech company. But because of the borderless nature of IP, companies such as Amazon or Google LLC can develop software ideas at branch plants all over the world, then sell the resulting products from those ideas through their central headquarters — typically in the U.S.
That process has led to criticism of such branch plants in Canada, which allow U.S. companies to develop IP while providing Canada little in the way of tax benefits or local job creation.
“My opinion is that government doesn’t know how to properly attribute the value of intellectual property developed by Canadians, as opposed to foreign branch plants,” said Craig McLellan, founder of ThinkOn, a data management company.
CCI has also decried the recent opening of human resources companies such as MobSquad in Calgary and Terminal Inc. in Waterloo, Ont., saying they provide little long-term value to the domestic economy because they channel much-needed Canadian workers into roles at non-Canadian firms.
The grand opening in October of MobSquad, which hires local engineers and developers on behalf of clients based in Silicon Valley, was attended by Minster of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Navdeep Bains, who has been central to Ottawa’s innovation efforts since 2015.
Bains appears to have aspirations to help build the next billion-dollar tech company in Canada. According to documents obtained by The Logic, an online news outlet, Ottawa believes it can create 10 technology companies worth more than $1 billion over the next 10 years, assuming the right policies are introduced.
McLellan and other executives appreciate the government’s newfound focus on technology under Bains and Trudeau, but say they have yet to see the necessary attention paid toward local companies.
As an example, McLellan points to a procurement bid opened in August 2018 by the federal IT agency Shared Services Canada (SSC), which was looking for private companies to consolidate a number of public data centres across the country.
As part of the bid, however, Ottawa stipulated that the firms had to have completed at least five prior data transfer jobs worth $10 million or more, ruling out virtually every Canadian tech firm, favouring multinationals such as IBM Corp. and Microsoft Corp.
Finding enough talent is another issue Canadian companies say they have, though foreign tech giants have strained the labour pool across the globe, not just in Toronto and Vancouver, said David Ticoll, fellow at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy.
“If you go to Silicon Valley, you’ll hear mid-size companies complaining about exactly the same issue, which is that the mega players are hiring all the best talent in these advanced fields,” he said.
Ticoll, like others, stresses that the problem is not new, but it’s difficult for Canadian policymakers to solve: neglecting to embrace multinational firms would make Ottawa seem closed to foreign investment, while letting them in threatens to put a damper on local industry.
CCI said Canada could begin to address the problem by barring foreign tech companies from accessing the Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&amp;ED) Program, a tax credit that allows companies to write off R&amp;D expenses. Currently Ottawa dishes out roughly $3 billion a year to cover such writeoffs.
In Ottawa, opposition MPs have a darker theory. Some say the problem is at least partly a result of the Trudeau government’s cozy relationship with lobbyists who represent foreign tech firms, which has benefited firms such as Facebook Inc. and Google.
For example, John Brodhead, a former chief of staff to Liberal ministers Amarjeet Sohi and Jane Philpott, left the party in April 2018 for a senior position at Sidewalk Labs, Google’s ambitious plan to build a digitally-connected urban space on Toronto’s waterfront.
The federal government, along with its partners, is one of the owners of the site where the project will be built. Brodhead played a key role in crafting Liberal infrastructure policy when Sohi was overseeing the file, which includes expanding digital infrastructure in Canada.
Similarly, Leslie Church, now chief of staff to Minister of Women and Gender Equality Maryam Monsef, came from a senior position at Google Canada in 2015. Before her role at Google, she had worked as an adviser to Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff. And Kevin Chan, formerly a policy director for Ignatieff, is now a senior executive at Facebook Canada.
“They have been so embedded with this Liberal government that decisions have been made that I don’t think are in the interests of Canadians, but are very much to the advantage of the data-opolies,” NDP MP Charlie Angus said.
“I think with this government, it was a belief that by being seen hanging with Google, hanging with Facebook, with Amazon, it would give them cachet. That might have been true in 2008, but I think it’s really out of place in 2018.”
On the other hand, policymakers around the world, not just Canada, are increasingly willing to attract companies any way they can.
For example, the Irish prime minister’s visit to SOTI’s facilities was part of a larger years-long effort to attract foreign tech firms to the country, often through a series of tailored government supports, consultancy services and tax breaks.
Tech companies have taken notice. Ireland has lured a number of sizeable players in recent years, including Facebook, which recently announced it would be expanding its Dublin headquarters and doubling current staff to around 8,000.
Rodrigues said that even a small gesture by government can have an outsized impact on a medium-sized firm such as SOTI, particularly as governments from Israel to Chile are aggressively picking off the most promising young startups.
“It’s an incredible honour to have the head of a country visit your operations, show an interest in your company, and talk to you one-on-one about the kinds of policies and supports he can offer you,” he said. “I don’t want to leave Canada, this is where I want to grow my company. But it’s hard when all these countries are throwing incentives in your face.”

303,Bioengineered milk and lab-grown meat: Tech firms bet the future of food lies in alternative proteins,"Big money is flowing into meat substitutes, including from some of the world's richest people, largest companies and most red-blooded venture capitalists",https://business.financialpost.com/technology/lab-grown-meat,"{'id': 'financial-post', 'name': 'Financial Post'}",2019-02-01T16:08:29Z,"It may seem like an unlikely spot, but in a converted Welsh farmhouse outside St. Davids, chefs are reimagining the way we eat. For the past three years, Britain’s first insect cafe, the Grub Kitchen, has been serving up a menu of cricket pakoras, grasshopper arabiatta, burgers made of mealworms and grub-fried chicken, or GFC.
If a diet of fried creepy-crawlies sounds unappetizing, there are plenty of experts who believe this and other protein-based alternatives — including cultured or lab-grown meat and bioengineered dairy products — represent the future of food.
With the world’s population on track to exceed 9 billion by 2050, alternative proteins will be essential to feed growing numbers of hungry mouths as rising demand heaps extra pressure on land and resources, they say.
So will grasshoppers and lab-grown beef really be what will be served up at mealtimes in 20 years’ time?
Dr. Patrick Brown, founder of Impossible Foods, a food tech start-up backed by Bill Gates, which has raised US$400 million to produce next-generation burgers, certainly thinks so. This month, he called the rise of meat consumption that has accompanied rapid population growth as a “rocket ship to environmental apocalypse,” adding that his goal was to “completely replace animals in the food system.”
Big money is flowing into meat substitutes, including from some of the world’s richest people, largest companies and most red-blooded venture capitalists.
Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong’s richest man, is another backer of Impossible Foods, which sells its burgers at 3,000 restaurants and is gearing up to start mass distribution in U.S. supermarkets.
Unilever recently acquired The Vegetarian Butcher, a Dutch producer of plant-based meat substitutes, while Richard Branson has joined Cargill, the U.S. agribusiness giant, and Tyson Foods to invest in Memphis Meats, a producer of true “cultured meat” — the kind that can be produced in a laboratory from animal tissue cells.

With big beasts like this involved, it’s fair to say that alternative diets are no longer the preserve of hippies and eccentrics. In fact, the meat substitute industry is on track to generate US$5.2 billion in sales by 2020, according to Allied Market Research (AMR), an 8.4 per cent rise from 2015. That’s enough to arouse the interest of the most carnivorous Wall Street slicker.
And the potential for future growth is huge — or so the argument goes.
By 2050, the world’s population will exceed 9 billion people. In order to meet rising demand, the UN forecasts meat production will need to grow to 455 million metric tons, up from 315 million in 2014. That is simply unsustainable given the fact that the global meat industry already contributes 15 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, roughly equivalent to all the world’s vehicles, and about 15,000 litres of water is required to produce a single kilo of beef.
Last month, Dr. Brown jibed that Brazil was the country that “used to be famous for the Amazon.”
Environmental concerns are not the only issue driving investment in food technology. While some such as Bill Gates have cited the threat of climate change and resource depletion, others simply believe animal-free meat represents the next big thing for consumers who are concerned about poor conditions and cruelty in factory farms and the health dangers of eating a meat-rich diet.
“If we can grow meat without an animal, why wouldn’t we?” quipped Tom Hayes, Tyson’s chief executive, in an interview last year.
Skeptics who question the willingness of western consumers to embrace cultured meat need only look to the global dairy industry for a taste of what’s coming down the line.
If we can grow meat without an animal, why wouldn't we?
Tom Hayes, Tyson Foods' chief executive
Milk alternatives including soy, oat and almond milk have been exploding in popularity. In the US, non-dairy milk sales grew 61 per cent in the five years from 2012 and are now worth over US$2.2 billion per year. Globally, milk alternatives are predicted to reach US$10.9 billion this year up from US$5.8 billion in 2014.
What’s up next? A California company, Perfect Day, is close to mastering a technology to produce real liquid milk without any cows — by using biotechnology to brew identical milk proteins to those produced in the udders of a cow.
If it tastes good enough, it’s probably easier to imagine consumers embracing products like this than lab-grown meat or insects, which are likely to remain a niche market, at least for a time.

Perfect Day is planning to role out a commercial product as soon as next year. So in truth, it may be milk rather than beef where we see the swiftest change in consumer behaviour.
It won’t be plain sailing, of course. The U.S. Cattlemen’s Association is already gearing up for a fight, insisting that meat substitutes should not be allowed to use the term “meat” at all. It has already won a victory in the state of Missouri, which has become the first U.S. state to start regulating the use of the word.
But the innovators and food-tech pioneers may have time on their side. In the 1880s, the U.S. dairy farm lobby fought a long and bitter campaign against margarine.
In 1886 they succeeded in banning the product altogether from six states including Ohio and Michigan and forcing margarine producers to inject it with pink dye. It didn’t last — and the margarine lobby eventually triumphed as cash-strapped consumers turned their backs on butter in the Thirties.
This time around, if they can develop products that taste close to the real thing, there is no reason to believe the food tech pioneers won’t succeed again — and the opportunity is vast.

In January, SEC filings revealed that LearnVest founder Alexa von Tobel will raise $200 million for a new early-stage venture capital fund called Inspired Capital Partners. Now, a source familiar with the nascent fund tells Fortune that billionaire businesswoman Penny Pritzker will join the venture as a founding partner. Both von Tobel and Pritzker declined to comment, citing SEC regulations.
Pritzker, whose family is behind the Hyatt Hotels chain, is the founder and chairman of investment firm PSP Partners. PSP has approximately 70 employees, and it deploys capital into real estate, mature private companies, and other investment funds.
But recently, shes taken more of an interest in startups and added a venture capital arm to the firm called PSP Growth, which focuses on investing in fast-growing tech businesses. Its portfolio companies include Beachfront Media, a mobile-advertising platform; House Canary, a real estate analytics and valuation firm; and Measure, a drone inspection-services provider.
I’ve always had an interest in innovation,” Pritzker told Crains Chicago Business in 2018. “I decided (technology) would become an area of focus for me after my time at the [U.S. Department of] Commerce. I’m a nerd at heart. Tech is affecting every aspect of our economy. My approach is to jump in with both feet.”
Now, shes fully taking the plunge by joining von Tobels new firm to invest in early-stage startups.
The duo met when Pritzker served as the U.S. Secretary of Commerce in the Obama administration. Von Tobel was a member of the Presidential Ambassadors for Global Entrepreneurship, which was a collaboration between entrepreneurs and the White House. The pair took a trip together to Morocco on behalf of the White House and discovered they shared a passion for building companies, according to the source.
Von Tobel and Pritzker both have operating backgrounds.
Von Tobel founded LearnVest in 2008, which is a financial planning service platform. Northwest Mutual acquired the startup in 2015 for a whopping $350 million. Von Tobel then joined Northwestern Mutual as the chief innovation officer and left in January to pursue her next act as a venture capitalist.
Pritzker founded Vi Senior Living (formerly known as Classic Residence by Hyatt) and co-founded an off airport parking company called The Parking Spot. She also sits on the boards of Microsoft and The Harvard Corporation.
It’s unclear what types of companies Inspired Capital Partners will back, but based on Von Tobels angel investments, it’s likely the firm will focus on startups within the financial technology sector.

BEZOS BLACKMAIL: In case you somehow missed the story thats blowing up my Twitter feed at the moment, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos published a detailed post containing emails from The National Enquirer that he believes tried to blackmail him over salacious photos he sent to girlfriend Lauren Sanchez. Rather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail, Ive decided to publish exactly what they sent me, despite the personal cost and embarrassment they threaten, he writes.
Once I got over the shock factor, I noticed something interesting (to me, at least) about Bezos latest comms strategy. This is the second time in two months that hes gotten in front of a potentially damaging story &amp; gained control over the public narrative. He published a Medium post before The National Enquirer had a chance to release his below the belt selfies, and he announced his divorce to his wife of 25 years via Twitter before any reporters could break the story.
As someone on Twitter said, Bezos just took crisis comms to the next level: get in front of the story by creating a new story before the original story becomes a story.
GOING PUBLIC: Add Postmates to the roster of companies going public in 2019. The on-demand delivery startup has confidentially filed for an IPO and chosen JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America as its lead underwriters. In January, it raised $100 million in venture funding from investors including Tiger Global and Blackrock at a valuation of $1.85 billion.
“We have a beautiful path to an IPO in 2019,” Postmates CEO Bastian Lehmann told me in September. “Listen, I’m an immigrant, and I came to this country to launch the Postmates business. My dream is to run a publicly-traded company.”"
306,New Brazil government backs former outlaw indigenous farmers,"BRASILIA, Feb 7- Brazil's new right-wing government is backing an indigenous tribe that was fined under the previous administration for commercial farming practices banned on tribal land, saying they are an example to be followed as it pushes to open reservat…",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/07/reuters-america-new-brazil-government-backs-former-outlaw-indigenous-farmers.html,"{'id': 'cnbc', 'name': 'CNBC'}",2019-02-07T16:39:00Z,"BRASILIA, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Brazil's new right-wing government is backing an indigenous tribe that was fined under the previous administration for commercial farming practices banned on tribal land, saying they are an example to be followed as it pushes to open reservations to agriculture.
The Parecis in western Mato Grosso state had partnered with local farmers to produce soy and were using genetically modified crops (GMO), both practices that are banned on reservation land. Environmental authority Ibama slapped the Parecis and the farmers with an unprecedented fine of 129 million reais ($34.72 million) last year.
But since far-right firebrand Jair Bolsonaro took office on Jan. 1, government officials have come out overwhelmingly in favor of the Parecis and allowing mechanized agriculture on indigenous land.
Nabhan Garcia, vice minister of land affairs at the Agriculture Ministry, praised the Parecis and said he would participate in the ceremony marking the beginning of their harvest next week.
""We're in favor of the Indian learning to farm,"" Garcia told Reuters in an interview.
""If he wants to lease the land, partner or plant it himself, it's his right. What's the problem? Quite the opposite, the day that the Indian starts to farm and to have his own income, it will be much better.""
Pareci tribe member Arnaldo Zunizakae, who helps manage the crop plantations on their reservation, said he was pleased to hear the government was sending representatives.
""That's great that they are coming. With these authorities getting a first-hand look at our reality, things will improve,"" Zunizakae said.
""The area we farm is 18,000 hectares (44,478 acres), but we only planted 12,000 hectares this season. But if we want to we can plant much more. The land is ours.""
Garcia said there are efforts underway in Congress to pass a law allowing partnerships and renting of land, which he believes has enough support to pass. He did not address the issue of GMO use on native reservations.
Activists say that stripping away protections on indigenous land would lead to environmental destruction and deforestation of the Amazon, the worlds largest rainforest.
Brazil's Environment Minister Ricardo Salles said last month that government agencies were overstepping their bounds in the case of the Parecis and likely elsewhere in the country.
Damares Alves - minister of women, family and human rights, which includes oversight of indigenous agency Funai - has also come out in favor of opening indigenous land to agriculture, as has Agriculture Minister Tereza Cristina Dias.

It's also the perfect excuse for celebrity couples to say ""I love you"" with extravagant gifts like a brand new Bentley or customized jewelry.
div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt;
Luckily, if you're a normal person (read: would prefer to save for retirement) looking to take a page from the multimillionaire's book of gift-giving, there are ways to express your affection without breaking the bank. Here are nine cost-effective alternatives inspired by celebrity gestures of holidays past.
The rapper has had a long history of buying walls of roses for his wife Kim Kardashian-West, which can cost anywhere between $2,395 and $100,000. If roses that cost as much as your student debt aren't in your budget, look no further than IKEA, where you can buy an artificial succulent for $9.99. You can even add a sweet note like, ""You make life succ(k) less"" (because what would really suck is having to figure out what to do with a literal wall of dying roses).
In 2017, rapperCardi B bought her husband Offset a brand new custom Rolls Royce, which can run anywhere from $450,000 to $600,000, depending on how custom we're talking. If you don't have an extra parking spot (let alone half a million dollars to spare), you can plan for a scenic drive while listening to a romantic playlist on Spotify. In a 40 miles per gallon car, it would cost you about $0.06 worth of gas per mile. After the drive, watch ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" and impress your Valentine with a fun fact: ""Did you know we could rent a Bugatti for $20,000 a day?""
Can you think of a more savory gift than a giant cheese wheel? That's what the R&amp;B hit-maker bought his wife Chrissy Teigen for Christmas in 2015. That's around $2,500 worth of cheese. If you're looking to splurge on a more reasonable level, make a fancy cheese board at home with Trader Joe's Unexpected Cheddar. It'll cost you only $3.99 per seven ounces, and you can get at least more than a thousand servings for the same price as a 80-pound cheese wheel.
For Valentine's Day in 2006, David Beckham reportedly gave his wife Victoria an $8 million Bulgari necklace adorned with diamonds and rubies (and probably stacks of one hundred dollar bills). Instead of stressing out your Valentine out by giving them $8 million worth of jewelry to wear around their neck, Etsy offers a variety of thoughtful gifts, like a necklace customized with their initials ($16), favorite flower ($27) or a picture of a cat in space ($12, but if you think about, truly priceless).
In 2009, Rebecca Romijn told InStyle her favorite Valentine's Day gift was one that husband Jerry O'Connell gave her: an entire grape vineyard at their home. Vineyard land alone costs between $60,000 and $160,000 per acre. Instead, sign yourselves up for a ""wine of the month"" subscription. It'll give you both an excuse to celebrate Valentine's Day all year long.
Before they got divorced, the actress reportedly gave Brad Pitt a 200-year-old olive tree for Valentine's Day in 2010. It cost $18,500, which is probably more than the price of your car. Rather than giving your Valentine the responsibility of keeping an olive tree alive, just make them an olive martini (less than $2 if you make it at home). You can even splurge on decent vodka (a 750-mg of Skyy Vodka costs $10.79) and fancy stuffed olives ($10.47 on Amazon) and still stay under budget.
While the two were engaged in 2005, the ""Mission Impossible"" actor reportedly bought (now-ex wife) Katie Holmes a $20 million Gulfstream jet. You know what's a good gift? Canceled plans. Tell your Valentine you need to wake up early to make a Valentine's Day brunch. When they wake up, say ""Just kidding! We're drinking mimosas in our PJs all day."" If that's not love for less than $20, then who wants to be in love?
The pop singer's marriage only lasted a short amount of time, but back in 2010, Katy Perry bought Russell Brand a $341,000 lilac-color Bentley Brooklands for Valentine's Day. A store-brand alternative to this name-brand gift is to upgrade your regular ride-share. Get an UberXL to dinner as a little indulgence that won't completely break your bank account (about $20, depending on how long your ride is).
In 2011, Justin Bieber reportedly rented out the Staples Center for Selena Gomez so the two could watch ""Titanic,"" a date that costs around $110,000 for the space rental alone. That sounds exactly like something a teenager with too much money would do. Instead, do something your teenage-self would've enjoyed on Valentine's Day: Get drinks and go to the romance section of your local book store. There's no joy quite like tipsily giggling at the back cover of soft-core books. (About $25 for cocktails, especially if you hit up happy hour. The giggling is free.)
