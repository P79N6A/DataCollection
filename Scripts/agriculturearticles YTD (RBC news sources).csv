Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. Home and interior design magazines frequently espouse this simple trick for refreshing your space: add a house plant. It's not only a strategic aesthetic move — research has found exposure to nature improves emotional well-being, making you happier and even more creative. I'm no scientist, but plenty of anecdotal evidence has also confirmed that shopping for and taking care of these beneficial house plants isn't as easy as the magazines make it out to be. After hearing similar feedback from friends, plant enthusiasts Ron Radu and Nico Bartoli wanted to show people that owning plants can actually be hassle-free and thus created Léon &amp; George, a full-service online startup that delivers potted, responsibly sourced plants right to your door. Radu and Bartoli started in 2016 by partnering with local growers who were looking for a change from big box stores and nurseries, which often placed unrealistic demands on crop growth or didn't store plants in optimal growing environments. Though the company has now scaled to a point where the founders don't need to turn their own homes into mini greenhouses, the level of care and attention remains: they source the highest-quality greenery from US growers, and all plants are stored under conditions that imitate their native climates. Léon &amp; George Customers can choose from a collection of attractive plants, like the dense Little Hope philodendron or the summery Parlor Palm, then pair their selection with a simple and stylish ceramic planter. You can also shop by ""Benefits"" (easy care, air purifiers, safe for pets) and ""Light"" (medium-to-bright, low). Everything is included in the $139 price: the plant, pot, wood stand, care instructions, and shipping. I ordered the Zanzibar Gem, namely because the website told me it's ""near indestructible"" and can ""handle long periods of neglect"" — music to the ears of traditionally terrible plant owners like myself. It can also handle low-light environments, so I could plan to keep it right at my office desk instead of a distant window sill. The potted plant arrived upright in a box, and thanks to layers of cardboard support and bubble wrap, it emerged from the shipping journey fresh and unscathed. Connie Chen/Business Insider Caring for my Zanzibar Gem has been a breeze. I basically water it whenever I think to (which is really not often) and it's still thriving a couple weeks after it first arrived. If you're worried about plant care falling by the wayside, Léon &amp; George sends Weekly Plant Care Reminder emails to nudge you to pay a little more attention to your plant. My experience with the service couldn't have been easier. Since I live in a big city, it's inconvenient and tiring to visit a nursery and haul a large plant onto the subway, so having it delivered (the company delivers nationwide) instead was a major boon. The potting was already done for me, and the site offers a lot of support if you run into any trouble while caring for your plant. Buying greenery from Léon &amp; George is also an investment back into the Earth because the company plants one tree in a US National Forest through the National Forest Foundation for every plant sold. Léon &amp; George 's selection of high-quality plants will appease plant parents of all types. If you're new to plant care, the site offers guidance and low-maintenance options, and if your room is already filled with greenery, Léon &amp; George's all-in-one service makes it that much more convenient to add to your collection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two regulations unveiled recently could be controversial: farm-size limits on some growers, and an apparently limitless number of licenses available for sale to large businesses. The idea of big business working its way into the marijuana industry is bad news. But it’s good news for investors. From growers to investors, the marijuana industry has most everyone seeing green. According to cannabis research firm ArcView, legal weed sales are expected to grow in North America by 26% a year through 2021, yielding a nearly $22 billion market. Of course, that could be touching the tip of the iceberg considering expansion opportunities in the U.S. and throughout the rest of the world. At the heart of this growth in the U.S. has been a major change in the way consumers view pot. National pollster Gallup showed in 1995, the year before California became the first state to legalize medical cannabis for compassionate use, that just 25% of respondents favored the idea of national legalization. By October 2017, favorability toward national legalization rose to 64%, an all-time high. A separate poll from the independent Quinnipiac University in April 2017 found an overwhelming 94% support for medical cannabis' legalization. Long story short, Americans are mostly believers in the green rush, and the result has been a steady increase in state-level legalizations in recent years. Currently, 29 states have OK'd the use of medical cannabis for specific ailments, while voters in eight states have green-lighted the sale of weed for recreational purposes to adults. New rules change the face of California's legal weed industry Among those eight recreational marijuana-legal states, none is more vital to the success of the pro-legalization movement, or to the industry, than California. Voters in the Golden State easily passed Proposition 64 by a vote of 57% to 43% in November 2016, clearing the way for adult-use sales beginning in 2018. Considering California's size, the addition of recreational sales is expected to generate $1 billion in tax and licensing revenue for the state, on top of what it already receives from medical cannabis tax revenue. By comparison, Colorado generated less than $200 million in tax revenue last year from legal weed sales (and that's counting both recreational and medical cannabis sales). However, new regulations unveiled last week that'll govern California's budding industry could end up causing controversy. While some of the regulations were straightforward (e.g., licensing fees and guidelines for testing, growing, and distributing marijuana), two subtle changes in this long-awaited rules release stood out like sore thumbs. First, prior to the release of legal-weed guidelines in California, it was expected that cannabis farms would have crop-size limitations imposed, ranging from one to four acres. The final product included farm-size limitations only on medium-sized growers' licenses, which could open the door for small- and large-scale cultivators to set up mammoth-sized grow farms. Second, and most important, as outlined in the Los Angeles Times, large businesses appear to be allowed to obtain as many licenses as they can afford. Big businesses have deep pockets, and small businesses are likely struggling to find banks willing to lend, meaning a veritable growing oligopoly could be established in California's recreational weed industry in short order. Is this good or bad news? It depends on your perspective For some, the idea of big business working its way into the marijuana industry is bad news. The emergence of larger players would likely push smaller growers out of the picture. Remember, deeper pockets should allow larger grow farms to outproduce and outpartner smaller growers. In fact, there's the real possibility that larger growers could flood the market with supply with the intent of driving prices and margins down on an intermediate-term basis. This could put smaller growers out of business, much in the same way that Wal-Mart has used its size to push around mom-and-pop stores. Without any competition, prices for cannabis would probably rise over the long run. This means consumers could also be long-term losers here. Even if the scenario above does play out and large cultivators oversupply the market in order to drive prices down, the effect would seemingly be only temporary. Larger players should mean an increase in long-term prices for cannabis to consumers. That's worrisome considering that California is planning to tax the daylights out of its consumers. Residents and tourists in some locales could see up to a 45% tax rate on legal cannabis sales when all is said and done. Then again, it's not all bad news if you're an investor, or looking to get in on marijuana's rapid growth. One of the biggest detriments to investing in the U.S. weed industry (aside from it still being illegal at the federal level) is that it's been highly fragmented. In other words, there are too many mom-and-pop growers and not enough larger players that merit investment. If just a few larger players were to emerge, it would give investors a clearer channel to possibly make money. The big question at this point is: Can California's recreational weed be price-competitive with the black market? Personally, I'm not too sure. The exceptionally high tax rate, compounded with the possibility of larger players dominating the market over the long run, could wind up driving consumers back to the black market. That would be a losing scenario for the state, growers of all sizes, and investors. Only time will tell. Read the original article on The Motley Fool. Copyright 2017.

3,Scotts Miracle-Gro Buys Sunlight to Double Cannabis-Grower Sales,"Scotts Miracle-Gro Co. agreed to acquire the top U.S. distributor of hydroponics products for $450 million in cash and stock, a transaction that will more than double its sales to cannabis growers.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-17/scotts-miracle-gro-buys-sunlight-to-double-cannabis-grower-sales,2018-04-17T21:35:15Z,"Scotts Miracle-Gro Co. agreed to acquire the top U.S. distributor of hydroponics products for $450 million in cash and stock, a transaction that will more than double its sales to cannabis growers. Chief Executive Officer Jim Hagedorn is making the company’s largest-ever transaction as he continues his three-year transformation of Scotts, the largest maker of lawn and garden products, into a force in the cannabis industry. Nine states and the District of Columbia now allow recreational pot use, and the industry is expected to reach $75 billion in sales by 2030 as more legalize marijuana, according to Cowen &amp; Co. Scotts agreed to pay $425 million cash and $25 million in shares for closely held Sunlight Supply Inc., the Marysville, Ohio-based company said in a statement Tuesday. Sunlight will merge into Scotts’ Hawthorne Gardening Company unit. “We are creating a game-changing moment for Scotts Miracle-Gro, for Hawthorne, the hydroponic products industry and the users of our products,” Hagedorn said in the statement. The deal is expected to close by June 1. Deal Costs Costs associated with the deal are expected to reduce earnings by 30 cents to 40 cents a share in fiscal 2018, Scotts said. Sales in the three months through March fell about 30 percent at Hawthorne because of regulatory changes in California, and about 5 percent in the U.S. consumer segment, the company said. Scotts shares were largely unchanged in after-market trading, after closing higher Tuesday at $85.14. The combined company would serve 1,800 hydroponic retail customers in the U.S. Sunlight has nine distribution facilities across North America. The deal will boost sales in Scott’s Hawthorne Gardening subsidiary to about $600 million, from $290 million, the company said. Sunlight’s sales last year were about $460 million, with 20 percent coming from distributing Hawthorne’s products. The company generated about $55 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. “The pending acquisition of Sunlight Supply now gives us the green light to aggressively optimize the businesses we’ve acquired and create a more efficient business that better serves the needs of consumers and our customers,” Hagedorn said. Scotts previously acquired hydroponic brands such as Gavita, Botanicare, Can-Filters, and General Hydroponics. By fiscal 2019, the transaction should add 60 cents to 80 cents a share to adjusted earnings, including plans to cut costs at Hawthorne by about $35 million. Scotts said it plans to boost Hawthorne profit to about $120 million with margins of 17 percent to 18 percent by the end of fiscal 2020.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,"US trade wars: The farmers who trust Trump, but not without worries","Support for the president is still strong in the US farming heartland, but there are concerns too.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-45451692,2018-09-08T23:20:48Z,"Media caption Michelle Erickson-Jones: ""We definitely want to get back to free trade"" Support for President Donald Trump remains strong in the American farming heartland but, as BBC North America correspondent James Cook found in Broadview, Montana, there are also concerns about the drift away from free trade. Michelle Erickson-Jones should be celebrating. On the Great Plains, the harvest is coming to a close and she is cutting the very last of this year's wheat, rattling across a golden field in a combine harvester which bristles with technology. In the cab more than half a dozen screens are pumping out data as the machine reaps, threshes and winnows. A tablet superimposes the track of the great green-and-yellow beast on a satellite image of the land. Farming here in Montana is a hi-tech business with a global market. The most important customer for this farm is not a bakery in the nearest village but the world's third largest economy, Japan. And that is why Ms Erickson-Jones is worried. ""We spent decades building that market,"" she says. So what happened? In a word, Trump. The president is enormously popular in Montana. In 2016 the Republican cruised to victory, beating his Democratic Party rival Hillary Clinton here by more than 20 percentage points. ""America is tired of getting ripped off,"" said the president at a rally in Montana on Thursday night, showcasing the blunt language which helped him into the White House. ""We're going to get a great deal for our farmers and ranchers and factory workers,"" he added. A good spot at the front of the rally was in such demand that a handful of fans had camped overnight outside the Rimrock Auto Arena in Billings. And yet this popularity comes despite, not because of, Mr Trump's approach to trade. It is a paradox which is not easily explained in a state where agriculture is by far the leading industry. On his third day in office, as he had promised during his campaign, Mr Trump pulled the US out of the nascent Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) which would have been the largest trade deal in history, covering 40% of the world's economy. His predecessor Barack Obama had envisaged the pact as a central plank of an American ""pivot to Asia"" with the aim of drawing countries around the Pacific Rim together in a fair, rules-based system, a challenge to China's statist capitalism. As a candidate Mrs Clinton also promised not to join TPP, which for a time appeared moribund until it was revived earlier this year by the remaining nations including Canada, Australia, Mexico and, crucially for Montana, Japan. Wheat and barley farmers in Montana say the effort they put in over several decades to cultivate Japanese customers now counts for little as the US, unlike the European Union, does not have its own trade agreement with Tokyo. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The president drew a large crowd of supporters at a Montana rally this week ""We have roughly 50% of Japan's market share right now,"" says Ms Erickson-Jones. ""It's definitely something we wanted to continue and even expand and without being involved in TPP we expect to lose about half of that market share."" Such losses will be a big blow for the rural US economy and for American prestige. Farming is entwined in this country's identity, its spacious skies and amber waves of grain celebrated by patriots who extolled the New World as a land of plenty. It is a description which remains rooted in truth. US crops are so plentiful that vast quantities of them are sent abroad. Statistics from the Department of Agriculture record American farmers exporting 50% of soybeans; 46% of wheat; and 21% of corn (maize), including ethanol. In 2017 the total value of US agricultural exports was assessed at $138.4bn. Montana is particularly dependent on such exports. ""Seventy five per cent of our wheat is exported,"" says Ms Erickson-Jones, the fourth generation of her family to farm land near Broadview in south central Montana. She says the decision to abandon TPP and the subsequent loss of market share in Japan is far from the only protectionist problem in the air. Mr Trump may have been cheered in the steel mills of Pennsylvania when he announced that he would impose tariffs on imports of metals but the decision was a double whammy for farmers and ranchers. First it pushes up prices for agricultural equipment made using imported steel or aluminium and for the metals themselves. Secondly, American farmers reported in March that China had responded to US tariffs by stopping purchases of American wheat. Media caption What are tariffs and how do they affect us? The White House denies it is protectionist, insisting instead that it is using its economic might to force China to abandon ""trade-distorting practices"" such as unfair state subsidies; restrictive rules for foreign companies operating in the country; and the theft of US technology. Peter Navarro, a senior White House adviser on trade and industrial policy, wrote in April that Beijing had ""broken every rule in the book"" as its economy expanded at a time when the US was losing factories and jobs. Ms Erickson-Jones, who is the first female president of the Montana Grain Growers Association, is careful not to criticise the president personally and says she understands why he took action against China. But while she applauds the idea of taking on Beijing she would like to see an emphasis on ""expanding our markets,"" including a plan to rejoin TPP. And she wants a speedy conclusion to the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), citing Mexico as another critical market for US crops. Mr Trump said again at his rally on Thursday that the Mexican aspect of the new Nafta deal had been struck and he hoped Canada would soon be on board too. He has also mused in the past about trying to re-negotiate TPP but there has been little evidence that he is actually preparing to do so. In the meantime, the administration is offering emergency bail-out payments to farmers and the US reputation as the breadbasket of the world is suffering. Montana's Democratic Senator Jon Tester says he too accepts the president's diagnosis of the problem with China but insists that he would have tried a different solution, forming an international coalition to put financial sanctions on Beijing, which he calls ""a bad actor,"" which steals technology and manipulates currency. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Senator Jon Tester has concerns about Mr Trump's tariff policy Mr Tester, a farmer himself, says he remembers with dread the early 1980s when the US government stopped its farmers from selling grain to the Soviet Union (a policy enacted by a Democrat, Jimmy Carter, in response to the USSR's invasion of Afghanistan and ended by a Republican, Ronald Reagan). ""I was on the farm in the 1980s... and I saw my neighbours leave in droves,"" he says. ""So the tariffs scare me. They scare me bad."" Mr Tester is campaigning for re-election in November's mid-term elections in the shadow of Yellowstone National Park - deep in Trump territory. ""If we don't have those foreign markets, we are literally dead in the water in production agriculture,"" he warns. Across the state line in Wyoming there seem to be more ranchers than farmers at the Cody Rodeo. Here in the town founded by the showman WF Cody, better known as Buffalo Bill, the crowd may not be following every twist and tweet from Washington DC but it is clear that they trust the modern day showman in the White House. ""Glad we have Trump to properly stand up for ourselves and maybe make a better deal for us,"" says Corey Forman, who hides a broad grin under a shaggy red beard and a black and white baseball cap which advertises farm loans. Image caption Despite concerns and a bail-out, loyalty remains strong among many Phil McVey is also in the audience, well-prepared for the evening's entertainment in four layers of shirts and jackets topped off with a smart light-brown cowboy hat. ""American farmers need help,"" he admits before adding quickly ""and whatever he [Trump] can do to help us, its fine."" Pressed on what exactly that should be, Mr McVey has a simple answer. ""He'll do the right thing. We like him."" There is a great divide here between the protectionism in Washington and the free trade preferred by farmers but it doesn't seem to be eroding support for the president. Time and again in the wilds of the west we heard the same thing: voters here trust Donald Trump to do the right thing. As autumn beckons though, concerns remain. Back on the farm Michelle Erickson-Jones says tariffs have already pushed down profits, putting the very future of this family enterprise in doubt. When I ask whether her farm will survive her answer - ""I hope so"" - is delivered with a laugh which does not sound especially reassuring. ""Nothing's certain in farming, so no, I'm not totally sure but we're OK for a couple of years,"" she continues. ""A lot of my concern is based on how long it's taken us to build these markets. It's easy to tear them down and tearing them down has a pretty big impact on the future of my kids' ability to farm. ""We definitely want to get back to free trade.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,The human-elephant conflict in India's tea state Assam,How expanding tea plantations in India's Assam state are putting humans in conflict with elephants.,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-42733022,2018-01-23T11:43:30Z,"Image caption The huge expanse of Assam's tea gardens bordering Bhutan Growers of world-famous Assam tea are encroaching into forests, fuelling a conflict between elephants and humans, locals and authorities in the Indian state have said. Officials blame small-scale plantations for most of the encroachment but local leaders told the BBC there was no up-to-date land survey of bigger tea ""estates"" either. A major association of tea companies has rejected the accusation, arguing that forest coverage is in its members' interest. However, a study by the Indian government has found that tea gardens are contributing to Assam's deforestation. ""The decrease in forest cover of the state is mainly due to encroachment in forest land, biotic pressure, rotational felling in tea gardens and shifting cultivation,"" the environment ministry's State of the Forest report said in 2015. Loss of life Official figures show nearly 800 people were killed by wild elephants in Assam between 2006 and 2016. One person dies every day in India after coming into contact with an elephant or tiger, according to the most recent figures made public by the government last year. Media caption Elephants roam through tea gardens in Assam Between 2014 and 2015, casualties related to elephant attacks were the highest in West Bengal state followed by Assam, which recorded 54 deaths in that period. ""I did not even get to say goodbye to my daughter who was rushed to the hospital after being trampled by an elephant,"" said Mariam Kerketta, a resident of Sessa tea garden village in south Assam. As she spoke, tears rolled down her cheeks. Last October, her 26-year-old daughter Bobita Kerketta jumped off a scooter her friend was riding after they were confronted by an elephant in a tea garden one evening. Image caption Mariam Kerketta's daughter Bobita was frightened of elephants from childhood ""Her friend managed to ride away from the scene but my daughter could not escape because there were tea garden fences on both the sides of the road,"" Mrs Kerketta said. ""We have been living in this region for generations but life now has become very dangerous here because of increasing conflicts with elephants, something needs to be done about it."" Elephants at risk This conflict also results in the death of elephants. According to India's environment ministry, 72 elephants were killed between 2013 and 2014, with more than 100 killed in 2012. Figures maintained by conservation organisations show that 225 elephants were killed by poaching, speeding trains, poisoning, electrocution, among other factors, between 2001 and 2014. India accounts for nearly 60% of Asian elephants. The highest population is in Karnataka state followed by Assam where they are believed to number more than 5,700. Image caption Elephants destroyed this wall beside a tea garden as it was hampering their normal route Conservationists say elephants are becoming more aggressive in Assam because their habitats are shrinking and even their traditional natural corridors are being encroached upon. ""Earlier, these areas were forests that were buffers between our reserved forests and villages. They were the sheltering places for elephants,"" said Manash Sharma, warden of the government's reserved forest in Uralgudi district. ""There was plenty of food and water for the elephants but later because of the increase in population, plantations of tea bushes began in these areas that are not under our control. ""These encroachments have now reached right to the border area with the reserved forests that we (Assam's forest department) control. ""And because elephants don't eat tea leaves, they now enter into villages and we see all these conflicts with humans."" Image caption The warden of Uralgudi forest admits that tea-gardens encroachment on forest land is a problem Mr Sharma insisted that only small-scale tea growers were encroaching into such forests. Officials with the revenue department of Assam who requested anonymity told us land was being recovered from some small growers who were illegally planting tea in forest areas. Small growers in spotlight The tea board of India, a government entity, has registered more than 56,000 small tea growers in 23 districts of Assam. But locals say there are equal numbers of small-scale growers who are not registered with the government. Many small growers also sell their produce to big tea companies. People living in tea-growing districts say there are questions for big tea companies as well. ""Why have their lands never been surveyed? Even those that were given the land more than 70 years ago?"" asks Dipen Boro, a youth leader in the Bodoland territorial area district of Assam. ""From our observation 30-40% of encroachment is from the (big) company tea gardens and we are pressurising the circle officer and concerned authorities to assess what is the exact position of the tea gardens,"" he said, adding that he will file a right to information request on the matter. Image caption Forest land being cleared for tea plantations in Assam The Indian Tea Association, an organisation representing most big tea firms in Assam, says the accusations are baseless. ""We have not gone into forests to denude forests, cut down trees and plant tea,"" Sandip Ghosh, secretary of the association, told the BBC. ""If we keep on denuding forests, it is the tea that is going to suffer. So it is in our own interest that we should have adequate green cover."" Mr Ghosh said it was not their responsibility to survey the land. ""We have no jurisdiction on land. We cannot influence the government on surveying or not surveying the land. It is the sole duty of the government to collect the revenue and survey the land."" Whether the government will ever audit all the lands covered by tea gardens remains to be seen.

But there are some lifeforms that have challenged gravity and won. These lifeforms include varieties of trees, ancient dinosaurs, and creatures of the deep ocean. The following is a transcript of the video. If you doubled in size, your weight would be 8 times greater. That's the trouble with growing tall. Gravity's pull is keeping us all down. But there are a few earthly giants that have fought gravity and won. The key to growing tall is how you use your energy. That's why the tallest trees outrank any animal on Earth. Because trees spend all their energy on one thing- growing taller than their fellow neighbors. And there are two trees that are the best growers of them all- giant Redwoods and Mountain Ashes. Redwoods are renowned as the tallest life forms on Earth. But some experts think that Mountain Ashes could grow even taller if humans would stop cutting them down. In fact, the tallest Mountain Ash was just 1 meter shorter than the tallest Redwood. Unlike plants, animals spend energy on all sorts of tasks like eating, walking, and staying warm. So, they can't grow as tall. But it doesn't mean they're small, either. If you measured this African Elephant from shoulder to ground it would actually be taller than a Giraffe! But thanks to their long, strong necks, giraffes are the tallest animals alive. And if we look at animals throughout Earth's history, dinosaurs eclipse them all. These towering Sauropods were the biggest of the bunch. In fact, the top 10 list of tallest animals in history? All dinosaurs. But, what if we looked at the longest lifeforms too? If you balance the longest Saltwater Crocodile on its nose, it would tie the Giraffe! And if we ignore legs, it gets even better! Tip to tail, the Green Anaconda nearly doubles the height of the tallest Giraffe on record. But these land dwellers have nothing on animals of the deep. Supported by water, sea life can practically ignore gravity. Which means they can grow much larger. Take the Blue Whale for example. It's the most massive animal of all time. The entire cast of Broadway's ""The Lion King"" can fit on its tongue! But it should be careful not to get tangled up in the tentacles of a Lion's Mane Jellyfish, which makes a Giant Squid look small by comparison. Now, the biggest fish alive is the Whale Shark. And if we look into the past, things get even bigger. And where do humans fit into all this? Somewhere near the top, actually. Humans are bigger than 87.6% of mammals on Earth. And the average Dutchman is the tallest of them all. So, there's no reason to ever feel small again, especially if you're from the Netherlands. Fun Fact: The longest lifeform of all time isn't a plant or animal at all. It's a Honey Fungus and the biggest one goes on for 3.8 kilometers underneath a forest in Oregon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,Can Nigeria's yams power a nation?,"""It's our biggest hope,"" Nigeria says of the humble crop as the country struggles to curb its economic dependency on oil.",http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-42197762,2017-12-04T00:10:21Z,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Nigeria is the largest yam producer in the world, growing millions of tonnes every year Can Africa's biggest economy swap its addiction to oil for the starchy tubers that millions line their bellies with each day? ""It's our biggest hope,"" says Nigeria's Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Audu Ogbeh. The global slump in oil prices has hit the West African nation hard, where oil exports make up more than 70% of government revenues. Yam production meanwhile is thriving - in fact the UN's food agency says Nigeria produces more than 60% of the entire world's yams. Despite this, Nigeria is not one of the world top exporters. Its neighbour, Ghana, produces far less but exports more yams to European countries such as the UK than Nigeria does. Spotting this discrepancy, Nigeria launched an ambitious yam export scheme earlier this year. What are yams? Yams are a staple food in temperate and sub-tropical regions - including Africa, the Caribbean and the South Pacific They are starchy, fibrous tubers which are grown in the ground Yams have brown tough skins and the flesh can vary in colour - anything from white to yellow to purple - depending on the variety It can be cooked numerous ways - boiled, fried or roasted Pounded yam or fufu - made by boiling, mashing and shaping yam flesh into balls - is a popular accompaniment to soups and stews in Nigeria and Ghana The term ""yam"" is often used in the US to describe the sweeter, orange sweet potato. It is hoped that exporting more yam will diversify Nigeria's oil-dependent economy, which has plunged into its worst recession in a quarter of a century because of falling global oil prices over the past couple of years. The government also wants to provide young people in particular with jobs in agriculture. Europe and the US are the main focus of the programme. And the large Nigerian diaspora around the world is also a potentially big market. So many growers and traders are encouraged by plans to boost exports. 'We are happy and excited,"" says Saleh Adamu Asiri, a local yam trader in the town of Agyaragu, a yam-producing community in central Nasarawa state. Image caption Yam trader Saleh Adamu Asiri is optimistic about plans to boost sales internationally ""Exporting yam is a big opportunity to expand our business and we are ready to export. The country will benefit too.'' Boosting profits Despite it being a government programme, the yam export initiative is driven by the private sector. The state is only responsible for striking inter-governmental agreements with importing countries, giving the green light for the trade. Some say there are already bumps in the road. ''I have been able to export 76 tonnes of yam to the US,"" says Prince Vincent Yandev Amaabai, a yam exporter. ""The main challenge is funding."" ""So if government can encourage banks to assist us, and liaise with the freight companies to bring down the price for us - that will be better.'' He says the high cost of preserving and transporting yams abroad have prevented him from making decent profits. It costs more than $10,000 (£7,400) to ship 30 tonnes of yams to the US, and transportation is slow - taking about 40 days to arrive in the US by sea from Nigeria. Some of the yams rot away before reaching the destination, adding to the overall cost. Just over 200 tonnes of yam have been exported to Europe and America since the scheme was launched in June - a fraction of the 60 million tonnes produced every year. More than 30% of Nigeria's yams rot away every year because of poor preservation. 'Yam is our hope' Nigeria's government wants yam and other agricultural products to replace oil as the mainstay of the economy after the recent worldwide oil slump. So desperate was the situation that government salaries have gone unpaid, with barely a mention made of developmental projects and social amenities.

''Fantastic idea! But ask them how much it costs to set up a yam flour processing factory,"" says the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Ogbeh. ""You use full grade stainless steel."" Mr Ogbeh says that for now, the best course is to export raw yams. ""We have obstacles in our economic ambitions. When we stabilise, and when electricity and interest rates become more reasonable and repayable, Nigerians can try that."" So can Nigeria's government really bring in more than $6bn ($4.5bn) every year with yam exports and create thousands of jobs, as it has claimed? 'Yes, and not only yam. Other items are going to follow,"" says Mr Ogbeh. ""But yam is going to be our major hope.'' 'We need more help' But Nigeria lacks good storage facilities, the transportation system is very poor, and local traders and exporters are struggling. There are also concerns that greater demand abroad could inflate prices for customers at home, potentially hitting the poorest who rely most on the staple food. ''We need help from the government,"" says Cecilia John, a farmer, who nevertheless backs the push for exports. Image caption Cecilia John produces yams in central Nigeria ""Help in terms of loans, tractors, fertilisers, herbicides and insecticides.

8,How changing coffee tastes are helping farmers,Growing numbers of consumers are prepared to pay more for coffee that is ethically sourced.,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42403021,2017-12-28T01:01:30Z,"Image caption Consumers are increasingly willing to pay more for ethically sourced coffee Would you pay more for your coffee if you knew exactly where it came from and how it got to you? An increasing number of Western ""millennial"" consumers would, and it's benefiting everyone from the farmers who grow the beans to the artisan cafes selling the stuff, everywhere from London to Los Angeles. The growing thirst for ethically produced, sustainably sourced coffee means farmers can be up to three-and-a-half times better off simply by selling their beans in the right way. According to new figures from the UN's World Intellectual Property Organisation (Wipo), smarter processing, branding and marketing makes a huge difference to growers and their communities. It means coffee drinkers like those at The Attendant, a cafe in trendy east London, know they can bring a sign on the wall to life. It reads: ""Change the world, start with coffee"". Image caption Attendant coffee The cafe tries to make customers aware of the specific story of the beans that made their cappuccinos and lattes, as well as the impact they are having by choosing to drink ethically. The Attendant develops relationships with individual farmers through green coffee traders so that they can carefully select beans from individual farms. Technology helps ensure the beans can be tracked all the way from the farm to the cup. When I visited I drank a £3 ($4) cappuccino made from beans grown in the Rwenzori Mountains of Uganda - about 18% more expensive than the average price of a coffee in the UK. However, the customers I speak to are happy to pay more than they might elsewhere if it meant the farmers were getting a fairer price for their beans. Marketing executive Amy tells me ""I do like to know that it's ethically sourced because you just feel better about drinking it"". ""It is important that the farmer gets a fair price for the coffee they sell,"" says logistics manager Eric, adding he also feels that consumers should be asking more questions about where their food comes from. Ryan de Oliveria, the cafe's co-founder and chief executive, says there is ""a large demand"" for ethical sourcing that goes beyond just buying traditional labels such as Fairtrade. One of their coffees comes from a particular farm in Uganda, a country not known for its coffee, but he says he has ""managed to find a farmer who is growing some really good beans"". Image caption Barista Mr de Oliveria says he tells all his baristas about the provenance of the coffee, so they can then tell customers. ""For example, there was a lot of warfare in Uganda and we talk them through the impact we are trying to make with those farmers to stabilise their communities."" The growing demand for coffee that does more than just perk you up has helped Ryan expand to three branches, as well as sell coffee wholesale and by subscription. ""People want to know that they are doing good and they don't want to buy something from a supply chain that is corrupt,"" he says. That sentiment is echoed by Wipo's director-general Francis Gurry. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Artisan cafes pay farmers a fairer price, says Wipo He says the evidence shows that ""ethical consumers, discerning consumers and farmers' interests can all come together to add value to everyone"". In practical terms, he says the extra income means a better quality of life for farmers and their families, but also ""the possibility of investing or reinvesting more in their businesses"". Instant coffee represents by far the biggest share of the global coffee market. As with any coffee it needs to be roasted relatively near to the end consumer so that it maintains its taste until it is actually drunk. That is why most of the margin added to the beans is pocketed near to where they are consumed, rather than where they are farmed. The Wipo research shows that for a pound (454g) of beans that ends up on a supermarket shelf, the roaster can earn $4.11 (£3.07). But the export price, most of which goes to the farmer, is just $1.45 (£1.09). Image caption ""Ethical consumers, discerning consumers and farmers' interests can all come together to add value to everyone, "" says Francis Gurry Large western coffee chains account for the next largest segment of the coffee market. They typically add more value to the beans by serving them as different espresso-based drinks which are brewed by baristas. The beans are often produced to the standards required for Fairtrade and sustainability certification. It means the roaster can get $8.50 (£6.37) and it's also better for the farmer and their community because the export price doubles to $2.89 (£2.16). However, farmers do even better when artisan cafes are the buyers. The roaster can get $17.45 (£13.02) and the export price climbs to $5.14 (£3.85). It's because consumers, typically western millennials in the US and UK, are prepared to pay more. Small, independent cafe owners are not alone in noticing that coffee aficionados are prepared to pay extra for ethical drinks. Image caption Kona Haque says established roasters don't want to be left behind by the new generation of coffee drinkers Over the past few years the two companies that sell the world more coffee than anyone else, Nestle and JAB (whose brands include Douwe Egberts, Jacobs and Kenco), have continued to spend billions of dollars buying up artisan rivals, such as the Californian chain Blue Bottle Coffee. According to Kona Haque, head of research at the commodities trader ED&amp;F Man, they are using their cheque books to try and maintain their market shares. ""What we're seeing is that these newer, more ethical coffee companies have grown strongly from a small base,"" she says. She adds that the more established roasters don't want to be left behind by the new generation of coffee drinkers who are embracing trends that started on the US west coast. While consumers in developing coffee markets are happy to drink instant coffee, Ms Haque says the speciality end of the market is ""high margin, high value"" and there is profit to be made. For Wipo's Francis Gurry it's a ""win-win situation"" because consumers get a higher quality product and ""can enjoy the knowledge of the specificity of what they're consuming"". More importantly, he says, farmers in the developing world are getting a better share in the global value chain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,Now Pot Growers Are Betting on Drinkable Weed,"Forget the ol' puff, puff, pass. Marijuana producers are betting an increasing number of people would rather pour a drink infused with pot.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-07/marijuana-is-the-new-beer-as-pot-growers-look-to-drinkable-weed,2018-06-07T11:00:00Z,"Forget the ol’ puff, puff, pass. Marijuana producers are betting an increasing number of people would rather pour a drink infused with pot. The Green Organic Dutchman Holdings Ltd. plans to develop a product-testing and manufacturing center to explore using cannabis in everything from iced teas, juices and sports drinks, the company said Wednesday in a statement. That’s just the latest move by pot producers to get a footing in beverages. While Canada has yet to pass the legislation that will make some forms of recreational pot legal this year -- including dried bud for smoking -- companies are already jockeying for position in the potentially lucrative beverage market. Although edible products, which could include hard candies, beverages, ice cream and baked goods, won’t be legal for at least another year, there’s been an “explosion of interest” in them, and six out of 10 consumers will probably choose to consume edible products, according to a June 5 report from Deloitte. “Many consumers are used to drinking intoxicants as it is more socially acceptable to smoking/vaping,” Jason Zandberg, an analyst at PI Financial in Vancouver, said in an email. “I do believe cannabis-infused beverages will be a strong product category in Canada when this edible category is allowed.” Outselling Soda Beer and alcohol makers have taken notice and “are looking into their rear view mirror” at the potential threat, Charles Taerk, chief executive officer of Faircourt Asset Management in Toronto, said in a June 5 cannabis webinar. The combined medical and recreational marijuana market could be worth as much as C$10 billion ($7.7 billion) in the next five to seven years, and there are some studies that suggest sales of cannabis-infused beverages will outstrip traditional soft drinks by 2030 in convenience stores, he said. Last year, Corona beer seller Constellation Brands bought a minority stake in Canopy Growth Corp, Canada’s largest marijuana producer. There will probably be at least one more major tie-up between an alcohol company and a pot producer, Beacon Securities analyst Vahan Ajamian said in a February note. Cannabis Cocktails? Constellation Sees Opening as Laws Ease Green Organic’s move comes amid speculation that the Ontario-based producer is a potential takeover target. Its research center provides a path for “large-scale beverage companies” to invest in the marijuana market directly or through a joint venture, the company said. The rise in cannabis legalization could be bad news for traditional alcohol companies. Retail sales of beer and wine experienced a “sharp decrease” in U.S. states that have legalized medical marijuana, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kenneth Shea said in a Feb. 5 report, citing research from the University of Connecticut and Georgia State University. Winnipeg, Manitoba-based producer Delta 9 Cannabis Inc. plans to introduce next week its ""Legal Lager,"" a rye-based beer that’s been infused with hemp seed and developed through the company’s partnership with craft brewer Fort Garry Brewing Co. While there’s none of pot’s psychoactive ingredients in the brew, the hemp gives it “a unique nutty finish,” and the plan is to eventually develop non-alcoholic beer that contains cannabis when regulations allow, said Delta’s Chief Executive Officer John Arbuthnot. “We’re very bullish on the drinkables segment,” Arbuthnot said by phone. “We sat down and tried to envision where does cannabis fit into all of our lives and how could we complete cannabis being at a family dinner, and it didn’t seem to be in a joint or a vaporizer or even a brownie.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,The future of food,Just four crops provide more than half the world’s food. Sayed Azam-Ali on why that needs to change,https://www.ft.com/content/843c2bbc-379a-11e8-8eee-e06bde01c544,2018-04-06T04:01:03Z,"The so-called “green revolution” of the 1960s was a pivotal moment for agriculture. Decades of investment in agricultural research — much of it supported by the US government — resulted in new, higher-yielding crops that were introduced to developing countries along with fertilisers, agrochemicals and irrigation techniques. These technologies transformed global food production, saving millions from starvation in famine-prone countries and setting the model for modern agriculture. In 1970, the “father” of the green revolution, Norman Borlaug, an American geneticist who helped pioneer high-yielding, disease-resistant crops, received the Nobel Peace Prize. He remains the only agriculturalist ever to do so. However, all revolutions have consequences. The need for food security favoured the intensive production of a few crops and the displacement of species that couldn’t compete in terms of yield or ease of mechanisation. As a result, just four crops — wheat, rice, maize and soybean — now provide more than half of the world’s food. More than seven billion people rely on these major crops, not just for food but increasingly as raw materials for animal feed and bioenergy systems. Any failure in their supply chains would put the world’s agri-food system in jeopardy. The success of the green-revolution crops has encouraged the agricultural industry to extract even more from them. New technologies, including drones, artificial intelligence, robotics and biotechnologies, target incremental improvements in the yields of the green revolution crops. The question is whether such narrowly focused gains will be enough. The green revolution was the future once, but the planet and humanity’s needs are no longer those of the 1960s. The decline in the diversity of our food systems is recent and risky, and has preoccupied me throughout my career. Back in the 1980s, during my postgraduate research in Niger, West Africa, I noticed that local farmers grew many more crops than those promoted by the government advisory service. One in particular — bambara groundnut — intrigued me. It appeared across the region, mostly grown on a small scale or in homesteads by women, while men grew crops such as maize in fields. Although attracting scant interest from researchers and development agencies, it was often climate-resilient crops such as bambara groundnut, with its nutritious and tasty seeds, that fed the family when maize failed. We will need not one but several solutions to transform agriculture so that it nourishes us without diminishing the natural resources on which we all depend When I joined Nottingham University in 1988 as a lecturer, I started researching bambara groundnut in earnest. Most senior colleagues were unimpressed; some were even hostile, telling me, “Don’t waste your time on these crops; if they were any good, we would have discovered them by now; they are underutilised for a reason.” Now, in the face of changing climates, researchers are beginning to see that underutilised species can help diversify agriculture and feed the future. Our task is to convince policy makers, investors and universities that diversity is an opportunity. The scale of the challenge is formidable. A rising global population coupled with a warming planet will lead to increasingly scarce water and energy resources — what Sir John Beddington, formerly the UK’s chief scientific adviser, has called a “perfect storm”. Demand for food and animal feed is set to at least double by 2050. Rural populations are moving to cities and arable land is being degraded. As our climate changes, green revolution technologies will become riskier, costlier and more demanding on the planet. We will need not one but several solutions to transform agriculture so that it nourishes us without diminishing the natural resources on which we all depend. Across history, humans have cultivated more than 7,000 crops. Forgotten “orphan” crops have been grown and protected by local communities for millennia, and represent a treasure trove of biodiversity. Instead of ignoring them, we need to select and improve the ones that can provide nutritious food — even in challenging environments. Once we recognise the need to diversify global agriculture, the next question is how. While agencies such as Bioversity International and the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation have long supported agricultural biodiversity, until recently there had been no global centre specifically for research on underutilised crops. In 2011, the Malaysian government and the University of Nottingham announced they would support the company Crops For the Future (CFF), as the world’s first centre dedicated solely to research on underutilised crops. The choice of Malaysia as the host country of CFF was against stiff competition from other countries and institutions. I was made chief executive officer in August that year. Our vision is to help diversify agriculture to support humanity in changing climates. We cannot do this alone and are building a global alliance of partners, from national and international agencies to universities, private companies and, most importantly, the communities that have protected underutilised crops until now without help or investment. One reason such crops are neglected is a lack of trusted information on their potential. Growers, consumers and investors are unlikely to diversify from familiar options without clear evidence of alternatives. So we are developing a global evidence base on underutilised crops to provide researchers, growers and policy makers with state-of-the-art knowledge on the advantages of particular crops in current and future climates. © Caleb Charland CFF researchers are also testing the nutritional content of crop ingredients and identifying prototype products. For instance, we have shown that insects fed on underutilised crops can be used to replace fishmeal in aquaculture feed. In the future this could extend to poultry and livestock feeds. We have also been applying technologies developed for use with major crops to underutilised crops to accelerate the breeding of new varieties. In his Nobel Peace Prize speech “Peace and Humanity”, Borlaug described the green revolution as: “A temporary success in man’s war against hunger and deprivation; it has given man a breathing space.” Fifty years later, this space is running out. To “breathe”, we need to diversify agriculture beyond a few crops grown intensively as monocultures. For “space” we need to cultivate more complex urban landscapes, such as roof surfaces and gardens, to encourage city dwellers to contribute to a new kind of agriculture. For generations, agriculturalists, scientists and funders have chosen to focus on obvious targets, such as increasing the grain yield of the top four crops. Not only have we forgotten the myriad of other crops that once fed us but we have ignored the multiple systems in which they were grown. These include “intercrops” of different species, agroforestry systems within tree canopies and crops that grow alongside livestock or aquaculture. Complex systems are not popular with scientific journals, statisticians and investors because it is not easy to demonstrate their advantages — but they may underpin the climate-resilient agriculture that we will need in the future. By growing more food, we may have reduced the spectre of hunger but we have not won the war against deprivation. Our global diet — energy rich and nutrient poor — is linked to an increase in diet-related diseases such as obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure. The double burden of over and undernutrition is especially evident in emerging economies, where active rural communities are rapidly becoming sedentary urban dwellers. Not only are there now more obese than underweight people on the planet but, in both cases, their diets are impoverished. More than 1.5 billion people suffer from micronutrient deficiencies caused by monotonous, calorie-rich diets; this is known as “hidden hunger”. Supermarkets may stock thousands of food products but they use the same ingredients again and again, often blended into processed products that are transported across the world. A diversity of products instead of ingredients means that a range of crops, animals and even insects have been displaced by a modern, uniform and processed diet. If we can rediscover such foods, we can test the suitability of the crops from which they derive and make products and cuisines from them that are nutritious and desirable. This needs a global effort that links our culinary heritage with scientific studies and new technologies. We increasingly recognise that a healthy diet contains fruits and vegetables, wholegrains, nuts and seeds, and fewer sugary snacks and beverages, processed meats and salt. However, we overlook the role that ingredients from forgotten crops can play in diverse diets. While they may not achieve the same yields, underutilised crops such as moringa often contain more vitamins, nutrients and phytometabolites than are found in cereals and other staples. If we can include them in our diets, we can put nutrition rather than calories at the heart of our food systems. Not only are there now more obese than underweight people on the planet but, in both cases, their diets are impoverished Last year, CFF launched the “ Forgotten Foods Network ” to share information on foods, recipes and traditions that are part of our common heritage so that we can create a library of forgotten foods and a global evidence base for consumers and researchers. My CFF colleagues are making tasty, nutritious products from the leaves of moringa, seeds of bambara groundnut, pods of winged bean, fruits of ambarella and even the flowers of butterfly pea. The opportunities are endless if we have imagination, evidence and raw materials. Like human societies, agriculture is at a crossroads. We can either protect and promote uniformity — or support and celebrate diversity. It is not a question of whether the green revolution has fed most of us but whether this model can nourish us in the future. While high-input crop monocultures are easy to justify in terms of yield, mechanisation, intensification and profit, they are increasingly vulnerable in volatile climates. While diverse crops and cropping systems are complex, they provide vital resilience. I now live in Malaysia, where CFF has its headquarters, a place which hosts 5 per cent of the world’s biodiversity. Instead of just plants, wherever I go, I see agricultural opportunities all around me. If you eat, you are involved in agriculture — we don’t have to leave it to others to provide all our food from far away. We need to see agriculture as a career for young urban professionals, a livelihood for displaced communities and an enjoyable activity for you and me. Our crops shouldn’t be limited to a few monocultures, but should include a multitude of species supported by knowledge of their uses, cultural values and benefits for humanity and the planet.

11,Big labor sees green in California pot workers...,"Big labor sees green in California pot workers... (Third column, 5th story, link )",https://apnews.com/4b847184a4084ea7a8fdbe6878295a0f,2017-12-25T19:04:37Z,"GOSHEN, Calif. (AP) — Unions have caught a whiff of a rare opportunity to organize a whole new set of workers as recreational marijuana becomes legal in California. The United Farm Workers, Teamsters and United Food and Commercial Workers are looking to unionize the tens of thousands of potential workers involved in the legal weed game, from planters to rollers to sellers. The move could provide a boost to organized labor's lagging membership — if infighting doesn't get in the way. The United Farm Workers, co-founded by iconic labor leader Cesar Chavez, says organizing an industry rooted in agriculture is a natural fit, and growers could label their products with the union's logo as a marketing strategy. ""If you're a cannabis worker, the UFW wants to talk with you,"" national vice president Armando Elenes said. But United Food and Commercial Workers, which represents grocery store employees, meat packers and retail workers, registered its intent to organize cannabis workers across the country. ""We would hope they respect our jurisdiction,"" UFCW spokesman Jeff Ferro said. Teamsters organizer Kristin Heidelbach said there's no need for unions to battle each other. There will be plenty of workers needing representation as small cannabis businesses run by ""happy stoner"" types give way to large pharmaceutical corporations, she said. The green rush that begins in 2018 is an opportunity for unions to regain influence that began declining in the late 1950s, said David Zonderman, a professor of labor history at North Carolina State University. But discord between unions could upend it. As could resistance from cannabis business leaders. ""Are they going to be new-age and cool with it,"" Zonderman said, ""or like other businesspeople, say, 'Heck, no. We're going to fight them tooth and nail?'"" Last year, California voters approved sales of recreational marijuana to those 21 and older at licensed shops beginning Jan. 1. Cannabis in California already is a $22 billion industry, including medical marijuana and a black market that accounts for most of that total, according to University of California, Davis, agriculture economist Philip Martin. Medical marijuana has been legal since 1996, when California was the first state to approve such a law. Labor leaders estimate recreational pot in California could employ at least 100,000 workers from the north coast to the Sierra Nevada foothills and the San Joaquin Valley, harvesting and trimming the plants, extracting ingredients to put in liquids and edibles, and driving it to stores and front doors. Other pot workers have organized in other states, but California should be especially friendly territory for unions, said Jamie Schau, a senior analyst with Brightfield Group, which does marketing analysis on the marijuana industry. The state has one of the nation's highest minimum wages and the largest number of unionized workers across industries. Its laws also tend to favor employees. At least some workers say they're open to unions. ""I'm always down to listen to what could be a good deal for me and my family,"" said Thomas Grier, 44, standing behind the counter at Canna Can Help Inc., a dispensary in the Central Valley community of Goshen. The dispensary — with $7 million in yearly sales — sells medical marijuana. Called a ""bud tender,"" Grier recently waited on a steady flow of regular customers walking through the door to pick out their favorite strain. He said so far, no unions have contacted him. Grier gets along with his boss and said he doesn't want to pay union dues for help ironing out workplace disputes. But he hasn't discounted the possibility of joining. After recently entering the marijuana industry, Los Angeles resident Richard Rodriguez said one sticky traffic stop three months ago converted him into a ""hard core"" Teamster. He'd never been in a union until this year. Rodriguez said an officer pulled him over delivering a legal shipment of pot and detained him for 12 hours as he was accused of following too closely behind a semi-truck. A union lawyer stepped in, and Rodriguez said he was released without being arrested or given a ticket. ""Most companies can't or are unwilling to do that,"" he said, ""because employees are easily replaced.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,Strawb bots,Strawberry producers say labour shortages are driving them to find robotic fruit pickers instead.,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43816207,2018-05-24T23:44:53Z,"Media caption Come strawberry-picking with robots With strawberry picking season well under way - but migrant labour in short supply in several countries - we look at the various robots being developed around the world to help producers harvest this most popular fruit. Next time you buy strawberries take a look a good look in the punnet. Do the berries still have the stem attached or has it been plucked off leaving only the green hat of leaves called the calyx? You may not think that matters, but it's a key consideration for growers as they contemplate the merits of a range of robotic prototypes that promise to pick strawberries as fast and as carefully as humans. Whether the berry is plucked or whether the stalk is snipped through and kept attached is one critical difference between the concepts that Spanish, Belgian, British and US engineers are testing, ready to roll out in fields as soon as next year. Fragile fruits Harvesting soft fruit mechanically represents a huge challenge - each berry needs to be located, even if it's behind a leaf, assessed for ripeness and then harvested and boxed with enormous care to avoid bruising. But recent developments in visual sensor technology, machine learning and autonomous propulsion have brought the goal within reach. ""If you can put a man on the moon you can get a machine to pick a strawberry,"" says Tom Coen, founder of Octinion, a Belgium-based start-up conducting a final phase of field trials this summer in partnership with growers in the UK and continental Europe. Image copyright Octinion Image caption Octinion's robotic arm gently grasps the strawberry, snaps it off, and drops it in the punnet ""Today we can say we have a [robotic] arm that is competitive with a human in terms of price and speed,"" he says. Octinion's arm is mounted on a self-driving trolley. It reaches up from below and, using 3D vision, grips a ripe berry between two cushioned plastic paws. The gripper then turns the fruit by 90 degrees to snap it off its stalk, mimicking the technique a human picker would use. The prototype is picking one strawberry every four seconds, says Mr Coen, and depending on the cultivar, will collect between 70% and 100% of the ripe fruit - results that he says make it competitive with human pickers. The berry is left with only the calyx, which is the way European consumers are accustomed to buying their berries. ""We don't believe in cutting,"" he says. Stalks risk bruising other berries in the punnet, he argues. Stem subject But Cambridge-based start-up Dogtooth is taking a different approach. Founders Duncan Robertson and Ed Herbert have just returned from Australia where they've been testing a picker that delivers berries with a centimetre or so of stem still attached, the way UK retailers prefer, because it extends shelf life. Dogtooth is cautious about giving away too much about how its robot works, but like Octinion it is based around robotic arms mounted on a mobile platform. Image copyright Dogtooth Image caption Dogtooth's mobile robotic picker leaves some stem attached to the strawberry It uses computer vision to identify ripe fruit and machine learning to evolve efficient picking strategies. After picking, the robot grades berries to determine their size and quality, and places them directly into punnets. Dogtooth also prides itself in working around the needs and current practices of UK growers. So while Octinion's machine will only work on fruit grown on raised platforms, usually in polytunnels, Dogtooth's will pick traditional British varieties in the field. ""Adopting robotic practice will be a big ask, so I don't want to ask growers to pull out existing infrastructure to support our robot,"" says Mr Robertson. ""We're trying to reinvent an important part of how soft fruit is grown, not reinvent the whole thing."" Rotting fruit Robots can operate at all times of the day or night - harvesting during the chillier night hours can dramatically lengthen shelf life and avoid bruising. But developers emphasise the motivation is not to replace migrant labour with cheaper, more efficient robots. In fact, it's not proving easy to replicate the standards that human pickers deliver. Strawberry farmers say they are increasingly struggling to find people to do the work. They need the robots. Image caption Strawberry picking is traditionally done by seasonal migrant workers In the UK, the fall in the value of sterling following the EU referendum vote has made it increasingly difficult to recruit overseas workers. UK citizens seem reluctant to do such seasonal, physically laborious work. In the US, growers say they have had to let fruit rot in the fields. Tighter immigration rules, a rise in the minimum wage, and a dwindling birth rate in Mexico, have all meant there just aren't the workers available to harvest them. Necessity So producers will have to scale up robotic picking if they're to survive, many argue. Agrobot, built by Spanish entrepreneur Juan Bravo, should be commercially available in California next year. And in Florida, the Harvest Croo team, led by former Intel engineer Bob Pitzer, is also close to launch. Both of these are much bigger than the robotic arms being developed by Dogtooth and Octinion. Image copyright Harvest Croo Image caption Harvest Croo's large-scale harvester can span several rows of plants Both boast tractor-like vehicles spanning several rows of plants with arms that reach down to locate and pick fruit. Each Agrobot arm grabs a stalk and snips, carrying the fruit off by its stem to minimise damage. The Harvest Croo (Computerized Robotic Optimized Obtainer) uses paddles to gather up the plant's leaves to expose the fruit. Rotating grippers then grasp and snap the berries off the stalk. Americans, like most Europeans, are accustomed to stemless fruit. More Technology of Business Image copyright Magnum Photos Mr Pitzer says two thirds of the country's strawberry production is backing the move to mechanisation. ""Growers advertise and pay a lot of money - a good picker can make $30 (£22) an hour [in Florida]; in California it's $50 an hour,"" he says. But they still can't recruit enough workers. ""People like to say if you paid them more they'd do the job, but it's just not true. We know in future that labour won't be available.""

13,Surprise threat in US tax law hits agricultural companies,Traders and processors weigh structural changes to avoid losing business to co-ops,https://www.ft.com/content/5e831526-11d3-11e8-940e-08320fc2a277,2018-02-15T05:15:26Z,"Agricultural trading and processing companies in the US farm belt are weighing changes to their corporate structures in an attempt to protect themselves from a surprise threat buried in the new US tax law. Businesses ranging from Bunge, an New York-listed grain and oilseed trader, to California nut processors are looking to establish or affiliate with co-operatives after the tax reform passed in December created a powerful incentive for farmers to sell to member-owned co-operatives rather than to other businesses. The tax provision known as Section 199A has upset executives in farm states that underpin the Republican majority in Congress, with passions building the longer the issue goes unresolved. The law allows farmers who sell crops to co-operatives to deduct 20 per cent of their revenue from federal tax. Those who sell to other businesses can deduct 20 per cent of net income — a lower sum. In some cases, the new deduction could “wipe out a farmer’s federal income tax bill entirely,” according to an analysis by Scott Greenberg of the Tax Foundation, a think-tank. In US farm areas, member-owned co-operatives such as Minnesota-based CHS, which $32bn in revenue last year, compete with companies such as Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland and Bunge in bidding for farmers’ corn, wheat and soyabeans. The difference in tax treatment could put the latter group of buyers at a disadvantage. Congressional leaders have vowed to fix the disparity. Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate finance committee, acknowledged Wednesday that the law was “having unintended effects in agricultural markets”, and pledged to find a solution that “does not choose winners and losers”. Juan Luciano, chief executive of ADM, told analysts last week his team has been reassured a fix will come in the “near future”. If a grower delivers to a non-co-operative, they are at a disadvantage of 13-14 cents per pound, which is pretty substantial Jeff Tatsumura, principal at K-Coe Isom However, US companies are pondering survival strategies as a legislative solution drags on. Already, farmers have shifted sales contracts away from private companies and towards co-operatives as they make plans for marketing 2018 crops, said a government affairs executive at a Midwestern grain company. Among the companies considering structural changes is Bunge, one of the world’s biggest agricultural traders, which buys crops from farmers at its grain warehouses and oilseed processing plants. “We have a Plan A, B, maybe even C that we can call upon in case Congress doesn’t do what it should, but we believe that it will,” Soren Schroder, chief executive, told the Financial Times. Options included “creating co-ops or partnerships with co-ops”, though it “would be a silly thing if you had to resort to that”, he said. Smaller companies are also searching for alternatives. If the law stood, “The farmer would never do business with a private (company) ever again. If we have to convert to a co-operative, we will,” said Dale Beyer, chief financial officer of Minn-Kota Ag Products, a family-owned North Dakota grain, seed and fertiliser dealer. In California, private almond processors are in the process of converting their status to co-operatives to compete with big cooperatively owned processors such as Blue Diamond Growers, said Jeff Tatsumura, principal at K-Coe Isom, an accountancy and consultancy. “If a grower delivers to a non-co-operative, they are at a disadvantage of 13-14 cents per pound, which is pretty substantial,” he said. Senator Orrin Hatch says the tax law is 'having unintended effects in agricultural markets' © Bloomberg Green Plains, a New York-listed corn ethanol producer, told analysts last week it had already formed a co-operative in the state of Kansas to procure farmers’ grain on more competitive terms. The National Council of Farmer co-operatives and the National Grain and Feed Association have said Congress’s intent with the legislation was to replicate tax treatment previously available to farmer members of co-ops. Mr Greenberg, of the Tax Foundation, said the new co-operative deduction extends to non-farm businesses as well. “Most worryingly,” he wrote, “it could create a major new hole in the US tax system, allowing a wide range of households and businesses to shield their income from taxes through the use of co-operatives.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,"Bridging the gender pay gap, on the red carpet and in the fields","The fight against the gender pay gap should start with rural women in developing countries, not in Hollywood.",https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/bridging-gender-pay-gap-red-carpet-fields-180308124732679.html,2018-03-08T15:20:42Z,"When discussing the Hollywood pay gap, we are talking more about differing scales of luxury rather than livelihoods. It is, of course, unacceptable for any woman to receive less than a man for the same job, in any walk of life or career path. But where equal pay and rights would make the greatest material difference - to education, to health and to economic progress - is at the sharp end of inequality: not in Hollywood, but with rural women in developing countries. These are the women who make up more than 40 percent of the agricultural workforce, performing labour-intensive tasks like raising livestock and hand-weeding, working much longer hours than men when domestic duties are taken into account. Yet these are also the same women often blocked from land ownership, who get just five percent of agricultural support services, 10 percent of agricultural aid, and can access a fraction of the credit available to invest in their farms and families. The difference that just a little extra income or support can make goes beyond the noble goal of equality. Increasing a woman's income by just $10 has the same positive effect on her children's nutrition and health as increasing a man's income by $110. Equal pay is a right that all women deserve, including those on the red carpet. But let's not forget about those women working in the green fields. And with equal access to the same resources as men, the benefits stretch even further to transforming millions of lives and prospects. Women farmers typically produce 20-30 percent less than men per hectare, not because they are less efficient but because they have less access to training, credit and inputs like improved seeds and fertilizer. By giving women the same opportunities as men, total agricultural output could be boosted by an additional four percent. This is equivalent of ending malnutrition for up to 150 million people in the world. The value of closing the gender gap in agriculture has been demonstrated in places like Bangladesh, where a Dutch-funded project helps train female farmers to become local leaders, or Farm Business Advisors (FBA). Led by iDE and partners, these FBAs develop networks across the agricultural supply chain to help farmers better access key materials and markets, and generate more income. It has helped women like Jahanara Begum, 45, bridge the gender gap not only by developing her own seed-selling business and unlocking new credit lines, but by equipping her to support other farmers across more than 250 producer groups. The project organises activities like post-harvest training between buyers and other market players to raise the value of crops, and in turn raise profit margins. In total, the project has seen more than 63,000 households move out of poverty with an increase in income per capita of around $420. Meanwhile, women account for just a quarter of landowners with official rights in Mozambique. But when major agricultural trading company EMCL began to recruit and train young women like Josefina dos Santos Lourenco to manage their input supply shops, they were able to simultaneously expand their businesses and begin to address the agricultural gender gap. Thanks to training in bookkeeping and marketing carried out in partnership with Fintrac and USAID, Josefina's inputs shop is now serving almost 1,000 farmers with essential products from appropriate fertilizers to improved seed. ""Today, I'm not only financially independent, but also my family is receiving lots of respect in my area,"" she told staff at Fintrac. And in Colombia, where women make up 40 percent of the cocoa growers' association COMCACAOT, USAID's Rural Finance Initiative (RFI) has helped re-balance the gender pay gap by helping individual farmers access loans. RFI supported COMCACAOT, an organisation that is only five years old, through targeted technical assistance and organizational development training prior submitting a loan request to Banco Agrario de Colombia. COMCACAOT was able to vouch for 374 of its members, most of whom were women. For female members like Lidia Grueso, who herself had already overcome gender barriers to become a manager of COMCACAOT, such support to access credit allows women to afford critical farm inputs and to pay the staff harvesting the cocoa. Meanwhile, to reduce the burden of unpaid domestic work for rural women, policy network FANRPAN is working in Ethiopia and Tanzania to make men aware of the need to participate more in household budgeting and chores. Following behaviour change workshops in several villages, men have begun to play a more active role in tending home gardens, collecting water and even attending the village cooking classes. By bringing men into this domain, the often overlooked hours that women work at home can be reduced, bridging yet another aspect of the gender gap facing female farmers. Equal pay is a right that all women deserve, including those on the red carpet. But let's not forget about those women working in the green fields. A level playing field for rural women can help plant the seeds for a better life for not only for female farmers and their families, but the entire developing world.

15,"In some U.S. states, most legal pot goes unsold","Despite legalization, criminal trafficking of marijuana remains a problem in parts of the U.S.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/in-some-u-s-states-most-legal-pot-goes-unsold/,2018-08-03T12:29:15Z,"PORTLAND, Ore. — Two of the first states to broadly legalize marijuana took different approaches to regulation that left Oregon with a vast oversupply and Colorado with a well-balanced market. But in both states prices for bud have plummeted. A new Oregon report by law enforcement found nearly 70 percent of the legal recreational marijuana grown goes unsold, while an unrelated state-commissioned Colorado study found most growers there are planting less than half of their legal allotment — and still meeting demand. The reports offer case studies for California and other pot-friendly states as they ramp up their legal pot industries. They also underscore some key differences in how broad legalization was handled that have helped shape differently evolving markets in each state. The Oregon study released by the Oregon-Idaho High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area — a coalition of local, state and federal agencies — includes the medical and general-use markets and the illegal market, despite gaps in data on illicit marijuana grows. It noted Oregon still has a serious problem with out-of-state trafficking and black market grows — and the top federal law enforcement officer in Oregon demanded more cooperation from state and local officials Thursday in a strident statement. ""What is often lost in this discussion is the link between marijuana and serious, interstate criminal activity. Overproduction is rampant, and the illegal transport of product out-of-state — a violation of both state and federal law — continues unchecked,"" said Billy Williams, U.S. Attorney for Oregon. ""It's time for the state to wake up, slow down and address these issues in a responsible and thoughtful manner."" The Colorado study, released Thursday, focuses on the legal, general-use market, and researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder's business school and a Denver consulting firm had access to state tracking data to produce the first-of-its-kind analysis. Colorado sales of broadly legalized marijuana began in 2014, roughly two years before Oregon allowed marijuana to be sold at non-medical retail stores. From the beginning, Colorado had stricter regulations for its growers than Oregon did. Colorado gave existing medical marijuana growers the right of first refusal for licenses, cutting down right away on a potential source of black market production. The state also requires growers to show they have sold 85 percent of their output before allowing them to expand their growing operation, said Beau Whitney, senior economist at national cannabis analytics firm New Frontier Data. ""That was the right approach, and we've made that recommendation to other state regulators to do that because if you exclude the medical folks from entering the market, then there could be propensity for diversion"" to the black market, he said. ""Colorado has done a good job in sizing the market. In Oregon, it's going to take a while for that balance to be established."" Oregon didn't give existing medical marijuana growers priority over new applicants as Colorado did, and it also didn't cap licenses. That created a perfect storm of endless licenses for all comers paired with less incentive for medical growers to enter the new industry. In June, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission, which oversees general-use marijuana, did put a pause on issuing new grow licenses to work through a monthslong backlog of applicants. The Legislature will likely consider steps to get a handle on oversupply in the 2019 session. The Pacific Northwest state also had to contend with a long-entrenched culture of illegal marijuana cultivation along its border with California, where there are near-perfect outdoor growing conditions. That tradition of illicit marijuana has created a nightmare for law enforcement agencies in rural, heavily forested counties already stretched thin by budget cuts. The Oregon report, for example, noted nearly 15,000 pounds (6,800 kilograms) of marijuana with a street value of $48 million has been seized heading to 37 other states. That doesn't include illegal pot snagged at Portland International Airport. ""I know a lot of the legal industry in Oregon has been asking for stepped-up enforcement to combat illegal operations, but there doesn't appear in those conversations a clear owner of the law enforcement,"" Whitney said. Although Colorado has been more successful in finding a balance between supply and demand, retail prices for bud, or marijuana flower, have plummeted in both states about 50 percent since 2015. That statistic could be deceiving, however, because most growers are now cultivating their crop for conversion into the increasingly popular oil extracts that wind up in everything from soaps to vape pens to edible gummies to salves. It takes 10 times more dried flower to make an oil extract and much of the dried flower is going to that market, Whitney said. ""What the report demonstrates to us is that our licensed operators are operating responsibly,"" said Mike Hartman, executive director of the Department of Revenue, which oversees marijuana regulation. ""They're not overproducing the amount of product they're putting in the marketplace. They are operating to maximize product but also... emphasizing public health and safety."" At Green Dot Labs in Boulder, CEO Alana Malone estimated the company grows about 1,600 of its allotted 1,800 plants that are used to produce cannabis oil products. As one of Colorado's oldest companies focused on producing extracts from marijuana plants, Malone said decisions about how much to plant are based on expected demand — and consumers' interest in the type of concentrate products that Green Dot Labs produces is growing. Malone said she was pleased that the Colorado study found about 32 metric tons of marijuana flower left in inventory by the end of 2017. ""That's not even close to some of the figures you see from others states,"" Malone said. ""So I'm a little bit proud of that.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,Mike Tyson’s Marijuana Ranch Is Going To Be A Giant ‘Cannabis Resort’,The race to lure THC tourists is officially underway in California.,http://fortune.com/2018/01/03/mike-tyson-marijuana-ranch/,2018-01-03T16:32:49Z,"Mike Tyson, whose career has spanned from world heavyweight champion to actor to pop culture icon, is adding another title: Marijuana kingpin. The man once known as Iron Mike could soon be known as Stoned Mike as he has broken ground on a 40-acre ranch in California that aims to be a “ cannabis resort ” for growers and enthusiasts of the drug. Located in the Mojave Desert, some 110 miles north of Los Angeles and just a stone’s throw from Edwards Air Force base, Tyson Ranch will set aside 20 acres for marijuana cultivation by “master growers” to develop new strains, reports The Blast. It also plans to offer an “edibles factory,” an amphitheater and an upscale campground. Tyson has been a cannabis advocate for years and is a big proponent of using cannabidiol (or CBD), which has the same non-hallucinogenic properties as marijuana, to help veterans who suffer from PTSD. Tyson’s not the only person looking to make a marijuana-themed destination for enthusiasts. Lat year, American Green bought the town of Nipton, CA, transforming the ghost town into a marijuana tourist destination, with plans to also use it as a production hub for cannabis-based products – including CBD-infused water. The company says it plans to spend $2.5 million by early 2019 to build out the town. Tyson has not yet announced a scheduled opening date for Tyson Ranch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,Marijuana Millionaires Ride Canada's Legalization Wave,"Terry Booth didn't expect his life would come full circle, thanks to marijuana.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-05/marijuana-millionaires-riding-canada-s-legalization-wave,2018-04-05T09:00:00Z,"Terry Booth didn’t expect his life would come full circle, thanks to marijuana. He sold pot in high school, peddling quarter ounces for C$25 ($19) to help out his dad. He spent the next two decades working as an electrician and entrepreneur, and planned to semi-retire to the golf course after taking a step back from his construction permit firm. That idea went to pot, literally, when his business partner Steve Dobler said his brother-in-law was looking for investors on a marijuana play. Terry Booth “Steve’s a pretty conservative guy; I thought he was kidding,” said Booth, 53, sitting in a hotel conference room in Edmonton, Alberta, not far from where Aurora Cannabis Inc. is building a greenhouse the size of almost 14 football fields. “But he wasn’t.” Booth and Dobler are the largest individual holders of Aurora, Canada’s second-largest marijuana firm. Their combined stakes are now approaching C$200 million, making them among the wealthiest shareholders in Canada’s growing crop of newly-minted marijuana millionaires. As Canada moves to legalize recreational pot, the value of the nascent market has ballooned to more than C$25 billion, swelling the ranks of affluent pot investors who have significant holdings in companies such as Canopy Growth Corp. and Aphria Inc. The U.S. legal market is expected to reach $75 billion in sales by 2030, almost as large as North America’s soft drink market, according to research firm Cowen &amp; Co. Canadian sales could soon be worth between C$7 billion and C$12 billion a year, Beacon Securities estimates. No Sales Even after a recent sell-off, many marijuana-related stocks have more than doubled in the last year. Never mind that recreational marijuana won’t be legal until later this year, and some publicly-traded companies have yet to make a sale. “Insiders have created a huge amount of wealth for themselves and even early investors,” PI Financial analyst Jason Zandberg said in a telephone interview. “It reminds me of back in the dot com days. You always heard of a friend of a friend who got in early and got their company bought out.” In the Green Canada's top pot millionaires Source: Regulatory filings compiled by Bloomberg Companies initially began piling into the sector in 2013 after Canada changed the rules governing medical use to allow access through licensed producers. Still, before Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wooed voters in the 2015 election with a promise to legalize recreational marijuana, publicly listed medical pot firms were trading for pennies. In mid-2015, Aphria traded for less than C$1, while PharmaCan, which later renamed itself Cronos Group Inc. and listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, hovered around 30 cents. The industry took off in 2016 as more investors rushed to bet on the country’s move toward legalization, with the BI Canada Cannabis Index more than quadrupling in value since then. Aphria now trades for almost C$10, and touched a record high of nearly C$25 a share in January. Cronos trades at more than C$7. For John Cervini, the co-founder of Leamington, Ontario-based Aphria, the magnitude of the market surge came as a surprise. Cervini had already left his family’s greenhouse business that sold tomatoes and peppers when he and friend Cole Cacciavillani started looking into marijuana as a possible crop. Neither had any experience with cannabis and initially thought you smoked the leaves of the plant (in reality, it’s the bud). Aphria was one of the first publicly-traded marijuana growers listed in 2014, and its value has surged more than 1,000 percent. It’s now worth C$2.1 billion, and Cervini’s stake exceeds C$96 million. Global Shift “I think we had an idea that in Canada it had some good potential but I think the real surprise has been the change in tide around the globe,” Cervini, 47, said in a telephone interview. “We did not expect to have a multi-billion dollar company.” It’s a similar story sector wide. Bruce Linton, the CEO of Canopy Growth, the country’s first marijuana unicorn with a market value topping C$1 billion, has a stake worth nearly C$73 million. MedReleaf Corp. ’s largest shareholder, Zola Finance, controlled by Tarik Ouass, owns shares worth C$227 million. Linton grew up on a hobby farm in Ontario and previously worked in the telecommunication sector. Some early investors are already taking money off the table given the soaring valuations, with some stocks trading at more than 100 times sales. Dobler, president of Aurora, sold 900,000 shares last month worth about C$10.3 million, according to regulatory filings compiled by Bloomberg. Booth, the CEO, sold 464,183 shares in the same period, data show. They still own more than 24 million shares between them. More Competition While the burgeoning new industry has spurred massive gains for some marijuana insiders, newcomers will face more competition. At least 89 enterprises have been given the go-ahead to grow pot since Feb. 1, and another 244 applications are under review, according to Health Canada. There’s also been a shift to more institutional investment as the sector moves toward legalization. Corona beer seller Constellation Brands Inc. is now the biggest holder of Canopy Growth, and the largest shareholder of Cronos Group is Chesapeake Partners Management, a Baltimore-based fund. “You’ve got to set your expectations to not assume they’ll do as well as the Aphrias and the Canopy Growths and the MedReleafs in the past,” Zandberg said. — With assistance by Maciej Onoszko, and Doug Alexander",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,Cocoa Farmers Get Relief as Rains Return Early in Ivory Coast,"Cocoa farmers in Ivory Coast, the world's top producer, got some welcome relief in the past week with higher-than-normal rainfall across the main growing regions.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-26/cocoa-farmers-get-relief-as-rains-return-early-in-ivory-coast,2018-02-26T12:48:33Z,"Cocoa farmers in Ivory Coast, the world’s top producer, got some welcome relief in the past week with higher-than-normal rainfall across the main growing regions. It rained heavily on Wednesday night for more than six hours, said Robert Glaou, a farmer in the western town of Bangolo. Harmattan conditions have ended, he said, referring to winds from the Sahara that bring dry weather and coolness to West Africa from December to February. “The weather is currently very good,” said Narcisse Konan, the head of a cooperative in southwest Ivory Coast. “There were small pods on the trees and we needed some rain to make them stronger.” The Harmattan overall was very mild this year, he said. Ivory Coast is nearing the end of its main crop, the larger of two cocoa harvests that runs from October to March. The rain will help development of the smaller mid-crop, although wet weather tends to slow harvesting. Satellite imagery from the U.S. Climate Prediction Center for Feb. 18 to 24 suggests well-above-average rainfall across Ivory Coast, as well as the biggest-producing regions of neighboring Ghana, the No. 2 grower. Small Pods “It has been raining in the area for several days,” said Jeannot Assi, a farmer in the southern town of Alepe, in Ivory Coast. “We are now seeing flowers and small pods” on the trees. There has also been heavy rain in Tiebissou, in the center of Ivory Coast, that will allow the trees to bloom, said farmer Moussa Kouassi. Growers have begun maintenance work for the mid-crop harvest, he said. While the weather has improved, harvesting volumes have decreased as the main crop peters out and farmers in the west and southwest said they’ve seen bean size and quality deteriorate. “The beans are small,” said Vincent Zadi, a farmer in Grand Zatry, in the southwest. More rains are needed to help the cocoa trees to bloom and produce small pods, he said. For farmers in the east of the country, the smuggling of beans into neighboring Ghana remains the biggest concern, said farmer Kobenan Kouame. In other West African cocoa-producing countries: Dryness continued in south-central Ghana and is negatively affecting crops, Boadi Yeboah, 69, who oversees a group of 2,000 farmers around Kwabeng, said Friday. There was “only a short period of drizzle last Thursday and that was the first sign of rain in weeks.” In Cameroon, there was some light rain last week that resulted in early flowering of some cocoa trees, said Ojong James, a farmer near Buea, in the west of the country There’s a risk those flowers may struggle as normal seasonal dryness resumes, but rain should fall again in March. In eastern Nigeria, farmers are optimistic about the mid-crop as periods of mildly hot and humid weather help new flowers develop on many trees, said Emajore Mapair, a grower in Taraba state; there is no dust and soil moisture levels are good. In the southwest of the country, it rained consistently for four days and plantations are looking healthy with bright green leaves on every tree and new flowers emerging, said Yakubu Aminu, a farmer in Edo state; there’s some concern about potential flooding. — With assistance by Olivier Monnier, Pius Lukong, Tolani Awere, and Ekow Dontoh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,California Pot Users Turn Out in Droves to Ring in Legal Sales,California rang in the new year with a newly legal product: cannabis.,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-02/california-pot-users-turn-out-in-droves-to-ring-in-legal-sales,2018-01-02T14:33:02Z,"California rang in the new year with a newly legal product: cannabis. The state officially launched legal marijuana Monday, and customers lined up to celebrate the historic moment in San Diego, Sacramento and Oakland -- some of the municipalities given the green light to start sales on Jan. 1. Meantime, in Los Angeles and San Francisco, the state’s first- and fourth-largest cities, customers were turned away empty handed. People wait in line at Harborside marijuana dispensary in Oakland, California on Jan. 1. “I had to come Day 1,” said Peter Papineau, 40, while standing in line for the Harbor Collective dispensary in San Diego. “It’s about time.” Papineau previously had a medical recommendation for cannabis, but didn’t get it renewed after California voters passed a referendum in November 2016 to legalize the plant for recreational use. Medical pot stores, which have been legal in California for more than two decades, must receive new state permits to continue operating. “I’m excited about going to a store to buy weed instead of just getting a little baggy,” said Will Doudna, 21, who was in line at the Harbor Collective with two friends. He also used to have a medical recommendation, but let it lapse. The market for marijuana in the state, the world’s sixth largest economy, is expected to reach $3.7 billion this year and more than $5.1 billion in 2019, according to the research firm BDS Analytics. Seven other states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational weed, boosting a market that Cowen &amp; Co. predicts will grow to $50 billion by 2026, up from $6 billion in 2016. Out the Door Lines were out the door and in some cases around the sides of buildings in San Diego, where stores were allowed to open at 7 a.m. Monday. “There were people in line 15 minutes before we opened,” said James Schmachtenberger, founder of Mankind Cooperative in San Diego, which previously sold medical marijuana and now is also licensed for adult recreational use. He says he expected his store to serve 1,500 people Monday, more than double a typical day as just a medical dispensary. While sales were set to start Tuesday in West Hollywood, customers in some other cities will have to wait. San Francisco stores are on track to begin recreational sales to adults on Friday. Los Angeles won’t be ready for at least a few weeks. As of Monday morning, more than 400 businesses had received licenses from the state to legally operate under the new California regulations, according to a statement from the Bureau of Cannabis Control. “This is an historic day for the state of California,” Bureau of Cannabis Control Chief Lori Ajax said in the statement. Inventory Crimped Even stores that opened on New Year’s Day were affected by delays in licensing to growers, manufacturers and distributors. That led retailers to remove some inventory from shelves. “This is less than half the products we normally carry,” Schmachtenberger said. Stores also used stop-gap measures designed by the state to facilitate the transition from one regulatory regime to another. They put purchases in opaque, childproof bags with stickers saying the product inside hasn’t been tested as required by the new legislation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,California braces for cannabis competition,"As the state prepares to fully legalise marijuana, established players are wary of new generation of start-ups",https://www.ft.com/content/fdb405f8-e1a7-11e7-8f9f-de1c2175f5ce,2017-12-27T05:00:29Z,"Listen to this article Play audio for this article Pause or Give us your feedback Thank you for your feedback. I‘ll use it in the future I don‘t think I‘ll use it Please tell us why (optional) When he was a child, John Casali used to listen out for federal helicopters hunting the hippie marijuana growers who had migrated to a remote patch of the northern California coast which became known as the Emerald Triangle. “It was kind of disturbing as a kid,” he says, shielded by huge redwoods that surround the small family farm he still runs in the area. That was not his only brush with the law: as a 22-year-old, he was jailed for eight years in 1992 for growing cannabis. But in the surprising second act of a life shaped by changing official attitudes to marijuana, the convicted criminal today is a member of his local chamber of commerce; he holds a county permit to grow medicinal cannabis on the same farm; and he is wading through paperwork for a full state licence, which will finally be issued in the new year. California has long been a cannabis pioneer. The state became a hub for the drug-induced counterculture of “turn on, tune in, drop out” of the 1960s, from hash-smoking hippies of Haight-Ashbury in San Francisco to Cheech &amp; Chong driving around the streets of Los Angeles in a van made from weed. California was both the first state to criminalise pot in 1913 and then the first to legalise medical marijuana in 1996. From the start of January, California is set to become the latest — and by far the largest — state to fully legalise recreational use of marijuana by adults. The decision completes a cultural and political shift all along the west coast of the US where the drug has been gradually decriminalised, offering people like Mr Casali a route out of an illegal industry and into a legitimate business. Full legalisation should be a vindication for Mr Casali and other members of the old-school cannabis industry that long battled with the authorities and made the case for new rules. A potential cannabis market worth an estimated $5bn a year, according to to Vivian Azer, an analyst at Cowen investment bank, is about to open up in the state with the biggest economy. But instead, many are anxious about the potential threat from another symbol of California — venture capital-backed start-ups. A new generation of businesses has emerged in the state intent on smartening up marijuana’s image and professionalising operations. As getting high becomes more mainstream, tall glass bongs and rolled cannabis cigarettes are being replaced by discrete, high-tech vaporisers. At the same time, big agricultural producers are looking to grow cannabis at scale. Many of the old-school entrepreneurs feel the state has botched the new rules for the sector, leaving a loophole that could allow large farms to dominate small cultivators and imposing business procedures so stringent that unconventional businesses — some of which have never kept formal accounts — are bound to slip up. Torrey Holistics employees arrange jars of cannabis in San Diego. Many of the old-school entrepreneurs feel the state has botched the new rules for the sector © AP With final regulations released only weeks before they were due to come into effect, cannabis operators are scrambling to prepare. They are also trying to navigate the tensions between state and federal drug policy, which will become ever sharper when a state the size of California officially legalises the substance. At the national level, marijuana remains in the same criminal classification as heroin and LSD. This means that legal cannabis operators cannot bank with nationwide financial institutions and are often left dealing with cash. To add to the uncertainty, US attorney-general Jeff Sessions has made his hostility towards legalisation clear. Saying he does not believe marijuana has medical uses, Mr Sessions has threatened to axe the single paragraph of federal law which prevents the national government from prosecuting medical marijuana users and growers. “States can pass whatever laws they choose, but I’m not sure we’re going to be a better, healthier nation if we have marijuana being sold at every corner grocery store,” he said this year. That means many in the industry will still be looking over their shoulder once legalisation becomes a reality. “Just because it’s legal with the state, doesn’t mean it’s legal with the Feds [Federal Bureau of Investigation],” said Mr Casali. “We’re in this little grey area.” If the federal government raided his farm like they did in 1992, he would have enough plants to get life in prison. He knows the costs all too well. During his eight years in a federal facility, Mr Casali’s mother and stepfather died in a commercial fishing accident. As marijuana prepares to go fully mainstream in California, many of the new entrants believe the first step needs to be a rebranding exercise to present cannabis as a social lubricant in the same light as alcohol. “I think we’ve all had enough of the stereotypical stoner,” says Evan Eneman, managing partner at Casa Verde, a venture capital company that invests in cannabis tech. (The rapper and entrepreneur Snoop Dogg is also a partner). Mr Eneman says that if weed is going to be widely accepted, it needs to appeal to professionals like him. In San Francisco, bright blue billboards trumpet cannabis’s benefits to the city’s highly strung technology workers. “Hello marijuana, goodbye anxiety”, says one advert from Eaze.com, a cannabis delivery start-up. Driven by $51.5m of funding from investors including the Winklevoss twins and DCM Ventures, Eaze wants to be an Uber for pot. Whether these VC-backed companies will be able to prosper in what is a low-margin business remains unclear. But they are already undercutting the old-school incumbents. Kevin Reed, proprietor of the Green Cross dispensary and a fixture of San Francisco’s cannabis scene, is closing the delivery service on which he originally founded his company, saying he can no longer afford to compete with upstarts like Eaze. His revenues this year, normally between $15m-$18m a year, are down 37 per cent.

But he is struggling to be upbeat because the fees and taxes which come with it threaten to double his prices. With a combination of state and municipal sales and excise taxes that could exceed 45 per cent, some in the industry warn that legal operators will be unable to compete with the black market — and some who have tried to play by the rules, such as Mr Reed, feel betrayed. “Now that our industry is being forced into profit, a lot of the compassion is going to be sucked up in fees and taxes,” Mr Reed says. He has been on the California State Legalization Task Force for two years, but concludes “they didn’t take a whole lot of our f***ing advice”. Mr Casali, the grower from northern California, says new taxes would eat away at his profits. “I can only produce a very little amount of cannabis,” he says Mr Casali. “Big Ag can drive that price down... we’re all seeing the prices plummet right now.” In the late 1980s he could charge $5,500 a pound. Now, he says, it’s $600-700. Galaxy's pre-rolled joints. As getting high becomes more mainstream, tall glass bongs and rolled cannabis cigarettes are being replaced by discrete, high-tech vaporisers © AP A last-minute change made to California’s cannabis regulations lifted the limit on the number of permits a single operator can own. This has left small-scale farmers worried that the new laws have made them even more vulnerable to consolidation from big commercial operations, which are now free to buy up as much land and as many permits as they want, potentially creating large-scale commercial farms whose increasing output might lower prices further. The revision “rolls out the red carpet for large corporations to crush the livelihood of small family farmers who should be given a fair chance to succeed in a regulated market”, wrote California senator Mike McGuire and assembly member Jim Wood in a letter to California’s licensing authority. But officials have defended the plans, saying that the regulations will foster a balanced commercial cannabis sector with room for both big and small businesses, with boutique enterprises able to attract higher prices through organic, farm-to-table style branding. Recommended Lori Ajax, chief of the state’s Bureau of Cannabis Control, disputes the idea that the new regime will fuel a black market as growers try to evade the new taxes. “People are looking to be able to go to a legal store, buy it, ask questions, know that it’s tested and safe,” she says, adding that licensing fees are scaled according to business size. Her agency is one of three dealing with cannabis — the public health department is regulating manufacturers, while the food and agriculture department is regulating cultivators. With many cannabis operators growing, manufacturing and selling their own product, they have a host of different applications to complete — and that’s after they’ve gone through a completely separate process to secure permits at the county level. Within days of its system opening, Ms Ajax’s Bureau already had 1,300 applicants. She expects a festive season tied to her desk in Sacramento: the final regulations were not submitted until November, giving businesses scant time to get lengthy applications together before the new year. Some smaller cannabis growers now use the premium language of winemaking — describing different growing regions as 'appellations' © AP “We don’t expect everyone to have a state licence come January 1,” says Ms Ajax. She says operators will be given a fair chance to get legal: “If we want to minimise the black market, I think we have to give time for people to transition.” The new regulations are painstaking. In a system called track and trace, the state of California aims to account for the whereabouts of the produce of every single cannabis plant — from the seed being planted all the way to a small amount of dried weed in a hash brownie — in real time. “These burdens are higher than I’ve ever seen in any industry,” says Ben Curren, chief executive of Green Bits, a software system that aims to streamline compliance for cannabis businesses. “Most small businesses have trouble doing payroll and taxes,” he says. “You now have to run like [US chain] Target or something, where you know where every single thing in your store is every single moment of the time.” A worker walks into a store selling Moxie marijuana in Lynwood, California. The state was both the first state to criminalise pot in 1913 and then the first to legalise medical marijuana in 1996 © AP But Ms Ajax is optimistic that regulation will foster a commercial cannabis economy that resembles California’s alcohol industry — which she previously oversaw — where consumption is in part driven by branding. Consumers are “going to want to know about who the cultivator is, a lot more branding and whatnot”, she says. “I think you’re going to find a savvy consumer market who is going to want to go to those stores.” Some companies are trying to make a virtue of their small scale in their branding. Mr Casali works with Flow Kana, a farm-to-table cannabis brand that uses the premium language of winemaking — describing different growing regions as “appellations”. It emphasises its growers’ relationship to the land and their organic, sustainable farming practices. For Mr Casali, although the regulations may not be perfect, any rules are an improvement on life as an outlaw. “I feel so much better having gone through this process [of securing permits],” he says. “I don’t feel scared every day I wake up.” Stoner apps: venture capital looks for green gains Marijuana start-ups have attracted increasing investor interest as the sector becomes less illicit. Data gathered by AgFunder, an online investment marketplace for the agriculture and food technology sector, show that total funding for US cannabis-related start-ups has more than tripled this year compared with the previous year, passing $325m. Some investors are taking advantage of the legal grey areas that persist in marijuana markets, to get in ahead of the competition. Al Foreman, chief investment officer at New York-based Tuatara Capital, a cannabis-focused fund, explained that the substance affords “the opportunity to generate outsize returns in a regulatory environment that causes concern for traditional competitors to enter”. Even so, his fund has waited to invest in California until the latest statewide regulations were in place. Indeed, much of the investment has gone into start-ups not involved in the production of cannabis, such as delivery apps like Eaze, or software vendors such as compliance company Green Bits, keeping investor money at arms-length from the prohibited substance. One example of the new generation of companies is MedMen, a Los Angeles-based business that aims to introduce modern management expertise to the cannabis industry. The company offers management services to facilities that grow, extract and produce marijuana, as well as retail operations in California and New York — in effect, a kind of cannabis outsourcing service. It also runs a cannabis investment vehicle — its second fund will be worth $250m. In 18 months, the company has grown from 45 employees to 350, says Daniel Yi at MedMen. He rejects the idea that the cannabis industry is a battle between small and big operators. “The world is changing and if you adapt to the new world you will succeed, and if you don’t you will fail,” he says. He adds that the new, regulated market for a once-controlled substance is bound to be strict: “We’re not selling coffee here.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,"States 'won't push the panic button,' as even Republicans condemn U.S. pot stance","The Trump administration announced Thursday it's ending an Obama-era policy to tread lightly on enforcing U.S. marijuana laws, a declaration met with resistance by several Republicans.",http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/sessions-marijuana-states-defiance-1.4474305,2018-01-05T14:04:52Z,"The buzz kill long dreaded in the marijuana industry came just days after California opened what is expected to be the world's largest legal pot market. The Trump administration announced Thursday it was ending an Obama-era policy to tread lightly on enforcing U.S. marijuana laws. The declaration renewed anxiety, confusion and uncertainty that has long shadowed the bright green leafy drug still forbidden under federal law, but now legal in a majority of states as medicine and in a handful of those for recreational purposes. ""Everybody is super worried. My phone has been going off the hook,"" said Terry Blevins, who runs a security firm and is part-owner of a marijuana distribution company in Southern California. ""They are all, `What does this mean?... Is the federal government going to come into California"" to raid businesses? Officials wouldn't say if federal prosecutors would target pot shops and legal growers, nor would they speculate on whether pot prosecutions would increase. The action by Attorney General Jeff Sessions was not unexpected given his longtime opposition to pot, but comes at a heady time for the industry as retail pot sales rolled out New Year's Day in California. In 2013, President Barack Obama's attorney general advised prosecutors not to waste money targeting pot growers and sellers that were abiding by state laws, but to go after flagrant violations such as trafficking across state lines or selling to minors. Under this policy, several states legalized recreational pot, growers and sellers had begun to drop their guard over fears of a federal crackdown and the business blossomed into a sophisticated, multimillion-dollar industry feeding state government programs with tax dollars. Sessions and some law enforcement officials blame legalization for a number of problems, including trafficking black market weed. Authorities are also concerned about stoned drivers and fear that widespread acceptance of the drug could increase its youth appeal. Sessions, right, said in 2017 that marijuana was 'only slighty less awful' than heroin, but Donald Trump once said on the campaign trail he wouldn't be in favour of using federal resources to interfere with states' rights on the pot issue. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press) Sessions made his views on marijuana clear at a March 2017 news conference. ""I am astonished to hear people suggest that we can solve our heroin crisis by legalizing marijuana — so people can trade one life-wrecking dependency for another that's only slightly less awful,"" he said. Advocates for the drug that is classified in federal law in the same category as heroin have argued that it has medicinal qualities and causes less harm than alcohol. They have said the government needs to focus on rampant opioid abuse and allow a regulated marijuana market that will reduce crime by eliminating the need for a black market. State officials not ready to change approach Pot proponents along with some members of Congress, including Sessions's fellow Republicans, roundly condemned the change in direction Thursday and said it was an intrusion upon the rights of states whose voters had approved use of the drug. ""If... Congress allows the Department [of Justice] to crack down on individuals and state governments, it will be one of the biggest derelictions of duty I will have witnessed,"" said U.S. Rep. Don Young, a Republican from Alaska. ""Congress is the voice of the people and we have a duty to do what is right by the states."" Republican Sen. Cory Gardner, who represents Colorado, one of eight states that have legalized marijuana for recreational use, said the change contradicts a pledge Sessions made to him before being confirmed as attorney general. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a potential Democratic candidate for president in 2020, takes questions Thursday in Olympia, Wash. Inslee and other Washington state leaders slammed the Trump administration's move to roll back Obama-era leniency on legalized marijuana. (Ted S. Warren/Associated Press) Gardner promised to push legislation to protect marijuana sales, saying he was prepared ""to take all steps necessary"" to fight the change, including holding up the confirmation of Justice Department nominees. Colorado's U.S. attorney, Bob Troyer, said his office won't change its approach to prosecution, despite Sessions's guidance. In Oregon, U.S. Attorney Billy J. Williams said he would maintain the same level of enforcement and focus on unlicensed production of marijuana and smuggling out of state. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, said the state, which allowed retail pot sales starting in 2012, would continue marijuana operations. ""We should, in my book, not push the panic button on either your individual lives or your businesses,"" Inslee said. Asked about the policy direction, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Thursday that ""regardless of what the topic is, whether it's marijuana, or whether it's immigration, the president strongly believes we should enforce federal law."" But when asked on the campaign trail in July 2016 if he would allow his attorney general to use federal authority to intervene Trump said, ""I wouldn't do that, no."" Some Californians feel 'targeted' Some sheriffs in California welcomed the news, particularly in the northern part of the state where the majority of weed has been grown illegally for decades and enforcement of laws largely falls to rural authorities with limited budgets. Yuba County Sheriff Steve Durfor said he's hopeful Sessions's actions signal a new willingness of federal authorities to help the impoverished region enforce marijuana laws. His department outside Sacramento has struggled to slow a large and growing influx of illegal operations setting up shop in the region. Officers destroyed a record 30,000 plants last year, surpassing the previous record of 8,800 plants destroyed in 2016. Officials denied the timing of the announcement was connected to California sales, which are projected to bring in $1 billion US annually in tax revenue within several years. Officials there, including U.S. Senator Kamala Harris, criticized the move. Instead of going after drug cartels, and violent crime, and major traffickers, Attorney General Jeff Sessions is going after recreational marijuana users. That’s not being smart on crime. https://t.co/BNlcxbTT4v — @KamalaHarris But it represents a continuation of Trump's contentious relationship with the state, which the president lost by 30 percentage points to his Democratic rival. Trump, who also lost the popular vote in the general election to Hillary Clinton by over three million votes, publicly cited the state as one in which untold numbers voted illegally, without providing supporting evidence. The administration convened a voter fraud commission to examine the issue, but that was shuttered this week. Trump and Sessions have also lashed out at Los Angeles and San Francisco officials, marking them as among the large ""sanctuary"" cities that defy the federal government in detaining illegal immigrants. At Harborside in Oakland, one of California's largest shops, founder and CEO Steve DeAngelo said it was business as usual and he wanted to assure customers not to fear shopping there. ""We've been targeted by the federal government before and we stand up and we fight for our rights,"" DeAngelo said. ""Six months from now if U.S. attorneys have not taken Jeff Sessions up on this crazy offer, then I think that it absolutely makes no difference to anybody.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,Northern hydroponic experiment sprouting into booming business,"Three months into a hydroponic experiment in Churchill, Man., the project is exceeding expectations. Fresh greens grown in a shipping container are being delivered door to door in the northern community, where fresh produce is otherwise hard to come by.",http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/churchill-hydroponic-produce-1.4568847,2018-03-20T08:00:00Z,"As in most northern towns, the concept of ""locally grown"" is exotic in Churchill, Man. So when Carley Basler shows up at people's homes with a big bags of fresh vegetables, it's little wonder people get excited. ""It's fresh food, fresher than probably anything that Churchill has ever experienced,"" Basler said. She knocks on a door, and inside seven-year-old Karalina Burke is excited. As the door opens, she declares: ""I ate three heads of lettuce!"" Her mother, Sandra Cook, is subscribing to Basler's Rocket Greens, Churchill's first locally grown produce. ""It's really remarkable we can have this here,"" she said. The produce grows in a hydroponic farm inside a repurposed shipping crate while chilling winter winds swirl outside. (Carley Basler) In the town of 800, perishables need to be flown in, making produce expensive. A head of lettuce at the grocery store can cost up to $7. By the time it arrives, it's often wilting, and its freshness and nutritional value have diminished. Basler's produce is fresher — and she's getting prices down to $3.50. Food security Food security is a problem across Canada's North, where climate and geography make it impossible for most communities to grow their own produce. Three months ago, the Churchill Northern Studies Centre started growing vegetables hydroponically as an experiment to see if it could address local food security on a commercial scale. The seedlings do not require soil in order to grow. (Cameron MacIntosh/CBC) It's turning into a fledgling business. Rocket Greens is named for the old rocket testing range where the Northern Studies Centre is set up. As winter wind whips up a windchill that feels like –50 C outside, Basler is tending to her soil-less hydroponic garden in a computer-controlled climate. She's harvesting giant plants of lettuce, arugula, spinach, and kale. ""What we are doing is growing about 400 to 450 units of produce that we can harvest weekly and make available in our community,"" said Basler, an electrician who took on the role of system manager. She's already supplying two grocery stores and a few restaurants while running her weekly subscriber program. Rocket Greens has only been up and running for a few months, but there is already talk of expanding. (Cameron MacIntosh/CBC) Eighty dollars a month gets each subscriber a weekly Launch Box, a bag full of greens guaranteed fresher than any southern grocery store. It's delivered the same day it's picked, she said.. It's also putting some variety into people's diets. Basler is growing items like pak choi, a Chinese cabbage and close cousin to the more widely known bok choy. ""We've been showing people how to cook it, they're putting it in stews,"" she said. ""It goes great with caribou."" Originally set up as a break-even proposition, Rocket Greens is already talking about expanding by potentially adding another farm. No reason not to grow food in North The ""farm"" is built into a shipping container also known as a sea can. Seedlings grow without any soil under LED lights in nutrient-enriched water. It was designed by Growcer Modular Food Solutions, an Ottawa company focused on northern food security. The Churchill system is the first of its kind in Canada. Growcer has six others in Alaska, all growing food on a commercial scale. ""We really think there is no reason why every community shouldn't be growing their own food,"" said Corey Ellis, Growcer's co-founder and CEO. The company is named for the Black Brant rocket, which marks the location of the former Churchill rocket range. (Cameron MacIntosh/CBC) While hydroponics have been tried in the north before with little commercial success, Ellis says Growcer is designed to turn a profit by letting growers start small and scale up. Each unit costs about $210,000 and is basically plug-and-play, requiring only electrical and water cnnections. Ellis says each unit has the potential to grow between $30,000 and $40,000 worth of produce a year. ""Many communities want to create jobs and economic development, they want to produce food so they don't have to rely on the south, but not in a way where they have to depend on grants,"" he said. The one thing it can't do right now is grow a root vegetable like a potato. Ellis says Growcer is working on it. The company plans to add half a dozen systems in Northern Canada this year, including one at Manitoba's Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation, also known as Nelson House. Fight over fixing rail line It all comes at a good time for Churchill. Last May, record flooding washed out portions of the rail line that was its only land link to the south, driving up the costs of goods that now need to be flown in. It's unclear when or if the service will be restored. The rail line's owners and the federal government are in court fighting over who will fix it. In the meantime, Churchill has been put on federal Nutrition North subsidies, which cover some of the costs of transporting essential groceries. Operating locally, with virtually no transportation costs, the Growcer system has the potential to relieve that vulnerability. ""It's available weekly regardless of rail service or air service or weather,"" Basler said. ""It's a lush green garden in the dead of winter, so that's pretty unique.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,Chronic Problems Cast Cloud Over California’s Marijuana Mecca,An envisioned pot paradise is going up in smoke.,http://fortune.com/2018/03/28/american-green-nipton-california-marijuana-tourism-pot-420/,2018-03-28T14:50:26Z,"An envisioned pot paradise is on the rocks. American Green, which had planned to transform the ghost town of Nipton, Calif. to a marijuana tourist destination, has sold the city, saying it could not raise the money needed to build what it envisioned. The company, one of the first publicly traded businesses specializing in the legal cannabis space, bought Nipton for $5 million last year. It sold the town (population 20) to Delta International Oil &amp; Gas for $7.7 million. The sale, says American Green, includes a provision that it continue the transformation efforts of the 80-acre town. It says it has signed a contract to develop the town for the next five to10 years. Where those efforts stand now is unclear. Originally, though, the company said it hoped to offer attractions including CBD (a chemical found in cannabis) and mineral baths, cannabis-product retail outposts, artists-in-residence programs, and various culinary events. It also planned to use it as a production hub for cannabis-based products— including CBD-infused water. Even if it does manage to turn Nipton into a weed wonderland, American General could have some competition for pot tourists.

24,UK supermarkets recall frozen vegetables over listeria outbreak fears,Dozens of products taken off shelves following recent warning from European health agencies over listeriosis,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/aldi-lidl-iceland-sainsburys-tesco-waitrose-recall-frozen-vegetables-listeria-outbreak-a8434571.html,2018-07-06T11:38:22Z,"Six of the UK’s most popular supermarkets have been forced to recall various frozen vegetable products due to concerns over possible listeria contamination. Aldi, Lidl, Iceland, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Waitrose have all recalled frozen veg, including packets of sweetcorn and mixed vegetables, because they could contain Listeria monocytogenes, which can cause listeriosis. Health organisations recently warned that an outbreak of the bacterial infection across Europe had been linked to frozen vegetables that were not cooked properly. According to the European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA ), there have been 47 cases of listeriosis as of 8 June 2018, nine of which have resulted in death. On Friday, the UK Food Standards Agency issued a list of dozens of products distributed by Greenyard Frozen, a Belgium-based supplier. The FSA said Greenyard “has taken the precautionary step of voluntarily recalling various frozen vegetable products because they might contain Listeria monocytogenes”. The agency said in its recall notice that “symptoms caused by this organism can be similar to flu and include high temperature, muscle ache or pain, chills, feeling or being sick and diarrhoea”. Some people are more vulnerable to listeria infections, including those over 65 years of age, pregnant women and their unborn babies, babies less than one month old and people with weakened immune systems. The FSA advised anyone who has purchased the products affected by the recall not to eat them and to return them to wherever they were sold. The following products are covered by the recall: Pinguin Frozen Sweetcorn Pinguin Supersweet Sweetcorn Tesco Frozen Broccoli, Carrot and Sweetcorn Steamer Tesco Frozen Every Day Value Sweetcorn Ross Mixed Vegetables One Stop Frozen Sweetcorn Aldi Four Seasons Frozen Vegetable Steamers Aldi Frozen Four Seasons Mixed Vegetables Pinguin Sweetcorn Aldi Four Seasons Supersweet Sweetcorn Waitrose Essential Supersweet Sweetcorn Waitrose Essential Mixed Vegetable Tesco Frozen Mixed Vegetables Waitrose Fine Cut Vegetable Steamer Waitrose Love Life Vegetable Medley Steamers Sainsbury Frozen Special Mixed Vegetables Growers Pride Mixed Vegetables Sainsbury Frozen Basic Mixed Vegetables Sainsbury Frozen Rice Broccoli and Sweetcorn Sainsbury Frozen Mixed Vegetables Sainsbury Frozen Carrot Broccoli and Sweetcorn Pinguin Supersweet Corn Lidl Frozen Green Grocer Supersweet Corn Tesco Growers Harvest Frozen Mixed Vegetables Lidl Frozen Freshona Vegetable Mix Iceland Frozen Mixed Vegetables Pinguin Frozen Mixed Vegetables Independent Mix Vegetables Ross Mixed Vegetables Pinguin Mixed Vegetable Pinguin Frozen Cut Beans Growers Pride Mixed Vegetables Ross Mixed Country Vegetables Growers Pride Supersweet Sweetcorn Pinguin frozen Golden Rice and Vegetables Growers Pride Supersweet Sweetcorn Ross Sweetcorn",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,Sand into soil,A Norwegian innovation could save millions of farms by transforming sand into fertile soil.,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43962688,2018-05-03T23:32:25Z,"Image caption Faisal Al Shimmari hopes the innovation will help him create ""a human Garden of Eden"" in the desert Faisal Mohammed Al Shimmari farms in some of the most extreme conditions in the world, at Al Ain, an oasis in the United Arab Emirates desert, where temperatures can reach 50C. ""It's expensive as we have to buy water regularly to irrigate these plants,"" he says. Farmers have to use tankers to bring in water, and in the desert farms use almost three times as much water as those in temperate climates. This makes farming in the desert impractical so the UAE imports about 80% of its food. Yet for many, this might be the future of farming. Increased drought, deforestation and intensive farming methods are turning an area half the size of Britain into desert each year. According to the United Nations Convention to Combat Climate Change, by 2045, 135 million people could lose their homes and livelihoods to desertification. That raises the challenge of how to grow food in increasingly hostile conditions, but one scientist has come up with an innovation that could turn those deserts green again. Liquid clay Norwegian scientist Kristian Morten Olesen has patented a process to mix nano-particles of clay with water and bind them to sand particles to condition desert soil - he has been working on Liquid Nanoclay (LNC) since 2005. Image caption Liquid Nanoclay halved the amount of water used to grow these okra plants in desert soil ""The treatment gives sand particles a clay coating which completely changes their physical properties and allows them to bind with water,"" he says. ""This process doesn't involve any chemical agents. We can change any poor-quality sandy soils into high-yield agricultural land in just seven hours."" Kristian's son Ole Morten Olesen, who is also the chief operating officer of the company they founded, Desert Control, says: ""We just mix natural clay in water that is inserted into the sand which creates half a metre layer into the soil that turns the sand into good fertile soil."" Normal sand particles are very loose, which means that they have a very low water retention capacity. But when you add Liquid Nanoclay to the sand it binds those sand particles together, says Kristian, which means it can hold water for longer, ""increasing the possibility of agricultural yield"". UAE trial Back in the UAE, Faisal agreed to host a trial of Liquid Nanoclay last December, and two areas were planted with a selection of crops: tomatoes, aubergines and okra. One was treated with LNC while a second control area was left untreated. Image caption Kristian Morten Olesen says liquid clay ""could be a game changer"" for farming in arid conditions ""I am amazed to see the success of LNC,"" says Faisal. ""It just saved consumption of water by more than 50%, it means now I can double the green cover with the same water."" He says that the untreated area used almost 137 cubic metres of water for irrigation and the one treated with LNC used just 81 cubic metres. ""I can double the farming area using the same amount of water I was using before,"" says Faisal. The cost of treatment per hectare (2.4 acres) of desert varies from $1,800-$9,500 (£1,300-£6,900) depending upon the size of the project - which currently makes it too expensive for most farmers. The soil requires a 15%-20% retreatment after four or five years if the land is tilled and if untilled then the treatment lasts for longer. Desert Control says initially it will target municipal governments and commercial growers, but eventually would like to make the cost accessible to all growers. ""This is a great game changer"" for farmers in arid areas, says Kristian.

26,Strawb bots,Strawberry producers say labour shortages are driving them to find robotic fruit pickers instead.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43816207,2018-05-24T23:44:53Z,"Media caption Come strawberry-picking with robots With strawberry picking season well under way - but migrant labour in short supply in several countries - we look at the various robots being developed around the world to help producers harvest this most popular fruit. Next time you buy strawberries take a look a good look in the punnet. Do the berries still have the stem attached or has it been plucked off leaving only the green hat of leaves called the calyx? You may not think that matters, but it's a key consideration for growers as they contemplate the merits of a range of robotic prototypes that promise to pick strawberries as fast and as carefully as humans. Whether the berry is plucked or whether the stalk is snipped through and kept attached is one critical difference between the concepts that Spanish, Belgian, British and US engineers are testing, ready to roll out in fields as soon as next year. Fragile fruits Harvesting soft fruit mechanically represents a huge challenge - each berry needs to be located, even if it's behind a leaf, assessed for ripeness and then harvested and boxed with enormous care to avoid bruising. But recent developments in visual sensor technology, machine learning and autonomous propulsion have brought the goal within reach. ""If you can put a man on the moon you can get a machine to pick a strawberry,"" says Tom Coen, founder of Octinion, a Belgium-based start-up conducting a final phase of field trials this summer in partnership with growers in the UK and continental Europe. Image copyright Octinion Image caption Octinion's robotic arm gently grasps the strawberry, snaps it off, and drops it in the punnet ""Today we can say we have a [robotic] arm that is competitive with a human in terms of price and speed,"" he says. Octinion's arm is mounted on a self-driving trolley. It reaches up from below and, using 3D vision, grips a ripe berry between two cushioned plastic paws. The gripper then turns the fruit by 90 degrees to snap it off its stalk, mimicking the technique a human picker would use. The prototype is picking one strawberry every four seconds, says Mr Coen, and depending on the cultivar, will collect between 70% and 100% of the ripe fruit - results that he says make it competitive with human pickers. The berry is left with only the calyx, which is the way European consumers are accustomed to buying their berries. ""We don't believe in cutting,"" he says. Stalks risk bruising other berries in the punnet, he argues. Stem subject But Cambridge-based start-up Dogtooth is taking a different approach. Founders Duncan Robertson and Ed Herbert have just returned from Australia where they've been testing a picker that delivers berries with a centimetre or so of stem still attached, the way UK retailers prefer, because it extends shelf life. Dogtooth is cautious about giving away too much about how its robot works, but like Octinion it is based around robotic arms mounted on a mobile platform. Image copyright Dogtooth Image caption Dogtooth's mobile robotic picker leaves some stem attached to the strawberry It uses computer vision to identify ripe fruit and machine learning to evolve efficient picking strategies. After picking, the robot grades berries to determine their size and quality, and places them directly into punnets. Dogtooth also prides itself in working around the needs and current practices of UK growers. So while Octinion's machine will only work on fruit grown on raised platforms, usually in polytunnels, Dogtooth's will pick traditional British varieties in the field. ""Adopting robotic practice will be a big ask, so I don't want to ask growers to pull out existing infrastructure to support our robot,"" says Mr Robertson. ""We're trying to reinvent an important part of how soft fruit is grown, not reinvent the whole thing."" Rotting fruit Robots can operate at all times of the day or night - harvesting during the chillier night hours can dramatically lengthen shelf life and avoid bruising. But developers emphasise the motivation is not to replace migrant labour with cheaper, more efficient robots. In fact, it's not proving easy to replicate the standards that human pickers deliver. Strawberry farmers say they are increasingly struggling to find people to do the work. They need the robots. Image caption Strawberry picking is traditionally done by seasonal migrant workers In the UK, the fall in the value of sterling following the EU referendum vote has made it increasingly difficult to recruit overseas workers. UK citizens seem reluctant to do such seasonal, physically laborious work. In the US, growers say they have had to let fruit rot in the fields. Tighter immigration rules, a rise in the minimum wage, and a dwindling birth rate in Mexico, have all meant there just aren't the workers available to harvest them. Necessity So producers will have to scale up robotic picking if they're to survive, many argue. Agrobot, built by Spanish entrepreneur Juan Bravo, should be commercially available in California next year. And in Florida, the Harvest Croo team, led by former Intel engineer Bob Pitzer, is also close to launch. Both of these are much bigger than the robotic arms being developed by Dogtooth and Octinion. Image copyright Harvest Croo Image caption Harvest Croo's large-scale harvester can span several rows of plants Both boast tractor-like vehicles spanning several rows of plants with arms that reach down to locate and pick fruit. Each Agrobot arm grabs a stalk and snips, carrying the fruit off by its stem to minimise damage. The Harvest Croo (Computerized Robotic Optimized Obtainer) uses paddles to gather up the plant's leaves to expose the fruit. Rotating grippers then grasp and snap the berries off the stalk. Americans, like most Europeans, are accustomed to stemless fruit. More Technology of Business Image copyright Magnum Photos Mr Pitzer says two thirds of the country's strawberry production is backing the move to mechanisation. ""Growers advertise and pay a lot of money - a good picker can make $30 (£22) an hour [in Florida]; in California it's $50 an hour,"" he says. But they still can't recruit enough workers. ""People like to say if you paid them more they'd do the job, but it's just not true. We know in future that labour won't be available.""

27,"Zimbabwe tobacco farms: Child labour, abuse rife, HRW says","Rights group says cases of child labour, worker exploitation and low pay are rife in Zimbabwe's tobacco farms.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/zimbabwe-tobacco-farms-child-labour-abuse-rife-hrw-180408072948552.html,2018-04-08T08:45:37Z,"Malpractice in Zimbabwe's tobacco growing industry is rampant, an international human rights organisation has reported after an investigation. In a report launched in the Zimbabwean capital, Harare, on Thursday, Human Rights Watch said cases of child labour, worker exploitation and low pay are rife on the farms around the Southern African country. Farm workers, the report noted, face serious health risk, particularly the younger labourers. The report, titled "" A Bitter Harvest: Child Labour and Human Rights Abuses on Tobacco Farms in Zimbabwe,"" documents how children work in hazardous conditions, performing tasks that threaten their health and safety or interfere with their education. ""Zimbabwe's government needs to take urgent steps to protect tobacco workers,"" Margaret Wurth, children's rights researcher at Human Rights Watch and co-author of the report, said. ""Companies sourcing tobacco from Zimbabwe should ensure that they are not buying a crop produced by child workers sacrificing their health and education."" The report said child workers are exposed to nicotine and toxic pesticides, and many suffer symptoms consistent with nicotine poisoning from handling tobacco leaves. Adults working on tobacco farms in Zimbabwe also face serious health risks and labour abuses. At one of the biggest auction floors in on the outskirts of Harare, Al Jazeera witnessed how teenage boys and girls were accompanying their parents, having to sleep at the floor premises after travelling overnight to sell their tobacco. Because they cannot afford to outsource labour, many rural families depend on the produce of tobacco, including underage children, who are forced to miss school or drop out altogether. Child labour and other human rights abuses on tobacco farms in Zimbabwe are likely to tarnish the $900m tobacco industry's contributions to the country's economic growth and improved livelihoods. Human Rights Watch conducted research in the four provinces responsible for nearly all of Zimbabwe's tobacco production. The report is based on interviews with 125 small-scale tobacco farmers and hired workers, including children or former child workers, in late 2016 and early 2017. Human Rights Watch also analysed laws and policies and reviewed other sources, including public health studies and government reports. The rights group discovered that the government and companies have generally not provided workers with enough information, training, and equipment to protect themselves from nicotine poisoning and pesticide exposure. Human Rights Watch found similar conditions on tobacco farms in research in other countries, including the United States. But where governments have enacted strong laws against child labour, and provided extensive information on how to provide protection, such as in Brazil, there has been some progress in keeping children out of the fields and protecting workers. Some of the world's largest multinational tobacco purchase tobacco grown in Zimbabwe, either directly or at auction, including British American Tobacco, Japan Tobacco Group, and Imperial Brands. Under human rights norms, companies buying tobacco from Zimbabwe have a responsibility to ensure that their business operations do not contribute to child labour and other human rights abuses. ""Most of the multinational companies involved have policies prohibiting their suppliers from using child labour and engaging in other human rights abuses, but Human Rights Watch's findings suggest there are serious gaps in carrying out and monitoring these policies in Zimbabwe. ""Tobacco companies should explicitly prohibit direct contact by children with tobacco in any form, conduct regular and rigorous human rights monitoring in the supply chain, and report transparently on their findings,"" Human Rights Watch said. One of the most serious health risks in tobacco farming is acute nicotine poisoning, or Green Tobacco Sickness, caused by absorbing nicotine through the skin from tobacco plants. The 14 child workers interviewed, and most of the adults, said they had experienced at least one symptom consistent with acute nicotine poisoning; nausea, vomiting, headaches, or dizziness while handling tobacco. Zimbabwe is the world's sixth-largest tobacco producer. The crop earns the country hundreds of millions in foreign currencies. Dewa Mavhinga, a Zimbabwean citizen who is Human Rights Watch's Southern Africa director, told Al Jazeera on Thursday that his organisation has met with the country's justice minister to present the plight of the workers. ""He expressed deep concern,"" Mavhinga said. ""It's something government says it will definitely look into."" Government officials were not able to comment, saying they needed to look at the report first. But Isheanesu Moyo, a spokesman for the Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board in Zimbabwe, said the regulatory board was ""deeply disturbed"" about the revelations contained in the report, although he questioned the gravity of the malpractice. ""We are concerned of course,"" Moyo told Al Jazeera. ""We are deeply disturbed with the reports of rampant abuses on the farms, and child labour. The only issue we have with the report is that of 125 000 tobacco growers in the country, only 125 cases were studied, so it (HRW report) might not be a national reflection of what really is transpiring across the country. ""But all the same, the issues raised a very pertinent. No child should be subjected to child labour or any abuse of any kind. We will definitely give it an ear and try to see to it that no such cases happen in our tobacco fields.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,"Shortage of legal weed would be a gift to black market, research suggests: Don Pittis",Attempts to protect kids from he evil weed could actually have the opposite effect by keeping criminal pot producers in business.,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cannabis-weed-pot-canada-1.4598560,2018-04-03T08:00:00Z,"It might seem the best way to protect Canadians from the evils of marijuana is to restrict supply and discourage advertising. But new research indicates such an intuitive approach may actually have the opposite effect, including making the drug more accessible to kids and diverting supply from people who need it to treat pain or seizures. Instead, based on evidence expected to be published this year, the best thing the government can do is increase supply and keep prices low. ""At the federal level, supply should be their main concern,"" says economist and policy analyst Rosalie Wyonch, who helped assemble the new data. While Canada's legal cannabis industry insists it is on track to squeeze out the black market, research from the C.D.Howe Institute, the Canadian think-tank where Wyonch works, contradicts that claim. The clear economic logic is that so long as there is demand beyond what the legal industry can supply when new legislation takes effect this year, a market supplied by criminals will continue to exist. Canada must take a lesson from Colorado where, despite legalization in 2013. cannabis persists as a commodity supplied by parallel legal and illegal markets.(Rick Wilking/Reuters) Evidence from places where weed has already been legalized shows the black market sector has actually boomed following a change in the law. In the Canadian case, the C.D. Howe investigation indicates that immediately after recreational sales are permitted, illegal suppliers will continue to control about half the market, wiping out roughly $420 million in potential excise tax revenue that would otherwise be collected. Medical shortage? The shortage of legal product has led to fears that licensed producers will divert supply from medical marijuana users in order to fulfil contracts to supply recreational pot. ""There's nothing to incentivize producers to prioritize medical consumers, and in fact because of contractual arrangements to supply retail stores, they may actually be incentivized to supply the recreational market over the medical market,"" says Wyonch, who suggests the government may have to step in to protect medical users. Failure to do so could put the government in breach of a charter rights ruling that says people who are helped by the drug — especially for seizure control — must be allowed access to it. Former Toronto police chief and Conservative cabinet minister Julian Fantino has listed his pot company, Aleafia, on the stock market. Despite rapid growth in the legal industry there are fears of a shortage.(Canice Leung/Reuters) ""Really, if someone needs something for pain management or for seizure management, I think as a society we can all agree that's more important than someone who's just doing it for fun,"" says Wyonch. A spokesman for the legal cannabis industry, Allan Rewak, scoffs at the claim that producers would ever divert supply from medical users. He says failing to supply the medical sector would be devastating to the industry's reputation. ""Cannabis Canada and its membership are very committed to its medical patients, and I'm confident in speaking with our members — all of which are licensed for cultivation or sale for medical cannabis — that there will be supply and support,"" says Rewak, acting executive director of the Cannabis Canada Association. Rules that favour the illegal market Rewak points out that medicinal strains are different from those used recreationally, and that the industry is looking beyond Canada to supply a much larger international medical marijuana demand. Of course in a profit-driven market there is nothing to prevent individual growers from planting different strains if they feel there is a business case for it. One place Wyonch and Rewak have room for agreement is on the rules for advertising and packaging that both fear may be too strict. Rewak says a crucial part of competing with the existing black market is enticing users to buy from unfamiliar legal sources. A boy smokes a hash pipe in Vancouver in 2010. High prices and restrictive advertising will only strengthen the illegal market where children have always got their pot, according to a study expected to be published this year.(Andy Clark/Reuters) ""That itself requires us to be able to communicate with our adult consumers who are consuming cannabis today and tell them about the strains, the product and the history,"" says Rewak. ""The packaging regulations that are proposed are a little bit too prescriptive to allow that."" As an economist, Wyonch suggests the danger of plain packaging is that the illegal and legal product will be largely indistinguishable commodities, like eggs or gasoline. In commodity markets, without packaging and advertising to point out the advantages of one brand over another, price becomes the only important measure. It would be as if wine were required to be sold in unmarked green bottles, leaving little to chose between Château Lafite and your neighbour's basement plonk. Plain packaging gives the advantage to the plonk. While governments will be wary of anything that will encourage more Canadians to use pot, it is essential that the legal industry has ways of making itself more appealing than the illegal alternative. As for users below the legal age, Wyonch points out young pot smokers have never had trouble obtaining supplies from the illegal market, and so long as the black market is allowed to remain strong that is where they will continue to get them. Doing everything possible in the first few years to make the legal market well-supplied and strong is imperative to reducing the power of Canada's well established illicit operations that control the recreational market. And Wyonch says time is of the essence. ""There's a limited time where the government can effectively squash the black market before it will become entrenched alongside the legal market.""

But while officials consider those new duties, Americans and U.S. businesses are already feeling the impact of earlier tariffs, such as those enacted this spring on imported steel and aluminum. Here are some of the products already impacted by tariffs or counter-tariffs, as reported across the country by local and national news outlets. Lobster In New England, prices for whole lobsters fell last month to a low around $3.80 a pound down from about $5 two weeks before China's retaliatory tariffs were implemented, according to the Boston Globe. The import duties on American-caught lobsters sold in China have caused Chinese restaurants and other buyers to look elsewhere for their lobster purchases. That's led to a glut of lobsters in the U.S., pushing down the per-pound price. A traditional lobster meal includes a 1.25 pound crustacean. In the Florida Keys, lobster prices were dropping in July, according to CBS Miami. Higher metal costs also may also push lobster trap component prices higher, the Globe reported. Mardi Gras beads Mardi Gras celebrants next spring can expect to pay a little more for beads and other accessories imported from China, AL.com reported. ""It has affected us,"" said Stephen Toomey, owner of Mobile, Alabama's leading Mardi Gras supply store, Toomey's, told AL.com. ""But I'll roll with it for the good of the country. It's our fiduciary responsibility to reduce the deficit."" Cranberries Cranberries, produced mostly Massachusetts, Wisconsin, New Jersey, Washington and Oregon, are also dropping in price because of retaliatory tariffs from the EU, Canada, China and Mexico, according to The Wall Street Journal. The average price slipped below $30 a barrel, or $5 below the cost of production, the paper said. Before the tariffs kicked in, the industry had anticipated those countries would deliver growth, Brian Wick, executive director of the Cape Cod Cranberry Growers' Association, told The Journal. Sports equipment The steel and aluminum tariffs are driving up costs for makers of specialized metal products that find their way into everyday equipment, like basketball hoops and goal posts, the Day of Connecticut reported. ""We've been getting monthly price increases from our vendors,"" Mary Fitzgerald, president of custom metal fabricator Acme Wire, told the Day last month. Tool boxes and gun vaults In the Chicago suburbs, gun vault and safe maker Stack-On Products is planning to cut 128 workers in suburban Wauconda and another 25 at a nearby McHenry plant when both facilities close Oct. 12, the Tribune reported. The company plans to move its manufacturing to Mexico, in part to avoid the Trump administration's tariffs on metal imported from China. Tents for parties and weddings American Tent &amp; Sidewall, a Wisconsin business that uses Canadian aluminum and Chinese polyvinyl chloride (known as PVC), tariffs on both materials may dampen growth. That's because U.S.-made vinyl is more expensive, and relying on it would force the company to raise its prices. ""I can absorb the tariff and take a huge hit to my bottom line. Or I can raise prices a small amount and absorb the rest of the tariff,"" owner Tony Ehrbar told the Green Bay Press Gazette. ""I may have to pull back on hiring staff or not grow as fast. The money's just up in smoke."" Fire trucks and municipal equipment In Rome, Georgia, tariffs may increase the price of fire trucks, the NorthWest Georgia News reported in July. Rome Floyd County Fire Chief Troy Brock said the cost of the $912,228 truck was slated to rise at least 3 percent. He's asking to lock in the price to save more than $27,000, the paper said. Local newspapers Newspapers are also suffering from tariffs on Canadian newsprint, the New York Times reported. American newsprint prices are projected to rise more than 30 percent in the next one to two years, adding about $500 million in costs, the Times reported, citing a study done for printers, publishers and paper suppliers. Boats Certain yachts and boats now face retaliatory tariffs of 10 percent from Canada, 15 percent in Mexico and 25 percent in the EU. The three markets represent 69 percent of the U.S. export markets, the Associated Press reported, citing the National Marine Manufacturers Association. Mercury Marine, based in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, is the last U.S.-based maker of four-stroke outboard engines, which are 40 to 60 horsepower engines it manufactures in China. Trump's 25 percent tariff on the engines may boost the price of a small recreational boat by about $2,000, CEO John Pfeifer testified at a recent hearing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,Joy to the weed: Stuffing stockings with legal pot,"The holiday season is a time to give, and in several states that means Santa is doling out presents of marijuana",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/legal-pot-christmas-holiday-gifts/,2017-12-22T13:36:17Z,"PORTLAND, Maine - Peter Bernard's Yuletide plans include dressing up in a tuxedo emblazoned with marijuana leaves, donning a green Santa hat and doling out cookie bars made with marijuana to his friends from a big pillowcase. ""That's me exercising my right to give marijuana this Christmas,"" said Bernard, a Taunton, Massachusetts, pot lover who heads the Massachusetts Growers Advocacy Council when not doubling as ""Pot Santa"" at events for weed enthusiasts. Not everyone's plans are quite so flamboyant, but for many pot lovers, this Christmas is much more about reefer than wreaths. Gift-giving has long been a part of marijuana culture, and the drug's newly legal status is a source of Yuletide celebration in four states. Voters in California, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts voted to legalize recreational marijuana last year, and some residents of those states will legally stuff stockings with spliffs for the first time this Christmas. Because retail sales are operating in only one of those states -– Nevada -- Bernard and others excited about legalized pot said homegrown marijuana is one particularly popular gift. ""I figure, I've got all this pot, I might as well just give it away for Christmas,"" said James MacWilliams, of Portland, Maine, who started growing weed when it became legal and is giving away fancy jars of his stash this year. ""I told my friends, you're all getting a little bit of pot for Christmas."" Others plan to give marijuana-infused baked goods or even decorations made of pot plants. Statistics about legal sales of marijuana suggest a modest bump around the holidays. In the four states where it was already legal (Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington), it has been ""generally a good month,"" slightly ahead of November and January, said Roy Bingham, chief executive officer of BDS Analytics, a firm that compiles data about the pot industry. December sales accounted for 9.38 percent of sales revenue in Colorado last year, which is one percentage point above average, according to statistics provided by the firm. California's retail laws begin next month, while Massachusetts' are scheduled for July and Maine's are still being developed. Legalization means pot lovers can legally do something they've always done, which is give away marijuana to people they love, said Aaron Smith, executive director of the National Cannabis Industry Association. ""People consume cannabis on the holidays, and they always have,"" Smith said. ""Now they are doing so through a regulated system."" The drug remains illegal on the federal level, which means activities such as driving it across state lines or sending it through the mail are off limits. Authorities will deal with incidents involving marijuana in interstate commerce ""on a case by case basis,"" said Matthew O'Shaughnessy, a Boston-based spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Hezekiah Allen, executive director of the California Growers Association, said marijuana was likely to be a part of Christmas in California this year whether it was legal or not. ""Cannabis has been pretty ubiquitous here for several generations,"" he said.

In line with a 2017 study that found marijuana grows are more damaging, plot for plot, than commercial logging in Northern California forests, Anthony said he has seen too many destructive grows. Trash-strewn clearings. Growers heaping fertilizer at the foot of a centuries-old sequoia tree, needlessly endangering it. Wild streams diverted for irrigation. ""It really bothers me when I see some of the other operations, the treatment of the land,"" he said. He came from Northern California's remote Lake County with his two business partners for the state-run seminar on just some of the water regulations pot growers must follow when California — the United States' biggest economy, and biggest producer by far in the underground U.S. cannabis market — legalizes recreational marijuana for licensed and permitted growers and sellers in the New Year. Complying with water laws alone would mean daily record-keeping, permit applications, inspections and more, state officials said. The three growers took in the volume of new environmental rules but were confident they could comply and be ready to go legal with their 1-acre (4,000-square-meter) farm, said Sullivan, sitting between her two male business partners. ""Oh, yeah, it'll be possible,"" she said. ""It'll just be a longer road"" than they expected. Hopes are that legalization will help rein in environmental damage from black-market grows, much of it in Northern California old-growth forests. But early signs are that only a fraction of growers are applying for permits immediately as recreational marijuana becomes legal here. At the briefing earlier this month, state regulators and consultants hoping to do business with pot farmers notably outnumbered the growers. Rachel Begonia of West Sacramento, one of those consultants, wondered aloud: Where were all the other cannabis growers scrambling to comply with environmental requirements? As legalization and all of its environmental oversight for farmers who go legal approach in just a few weeks, ""either they've got it in the bag, or they're going to try to fly under the radar,"" Begonia figured. It's impossible to know exactly how many growers statewide are planning to go legal, two years after Californians voted to legalize recreational marijuana starting in 2018. California's agriculture department just started accepting applications from growers this week, agency spokesman Steve Lyle said. By midweek, it had received fewer than 200 such applications and approved four, Lyle said. In Northern California's remote and forested Humboldt County, where an estimated 15,000 pot farmers grow illicitly now on private lands or in so-called trespass grows on tribal lands and publicly held forests, only 2,300 have applied for the required local growing permits, officials say. Humboldt County anchors a swath of California forests known as the Emerald Triangle, estimated to produce almost two-thirds of U.S. cannabis. Mourad Gabriel, a wildlife biologist in Humboldt County, has spent years documenting and sounding alarms over the damage that black-market marijuana grows wreak in California's sloping old-growth forests and virgin streams. A container of pesticide exploded in his face at one grow site, Gabriel said. All of the so-called trespass grows Gabriel has inspected have featured illegal diversions of water and some kind of toxic substances, he said. That's often in the form of old soda or water bottles refilled with widely banned poisons, such as carbofuran, and used to keep bugs or rodents from gnawing on drip irrigation lines or plants. He and colleagues conducted some of the first surveys of lethal poisoning of significant numbers of California's few hundred remaining fishers, a threatened carnivore. Overall, chemicals at grow sites threaten wildlife ranging from owls to bears to elk, Gabriel said. He's skeptical California is bringing strong enough enforcement to bear on environmental infractions. Even if half its growers decide to go legal, California will still have numerous pot farms that flout the rules, Gabriel said. ""If even a fraction have pesticide and water use... that's a concern. A definite concern."" California's Department of Pesticide Regulation is adding about 10 toxicologists and other scientists to its staff of 400 to deal with the pot industry, said Jesse Cuevas, assistant director of programs. ""It's not too often we get a multibillion-dollar industry regulated overnight,"" Cuevas said. Since marijuana remains illegal under federal law and California's list of allowed bug, mold and rat killers is tied to federal law, no conventional poisons are specifically approved for California cannabis growers. Pot farmers will be allowed only a limited number of conventional pesticides and those associated with organic farming such as cinnamon oil, citronella or traps. Cannabis sold legally in the state must be tested first for pesticides and other dangers. California's wildlife department has added about 100 law enforcement officers, scientists and others to deal with the marijuana industry, said Nathaniel Arnold, a deputy chief of law enforcement for the agency. State and local water boards are adding just under 100 staffers to deal with the industry's water problems, which include contaminating and destroying waterways, said Clint Snyder, assistant executive officer of one regional water board. Snyder expects many in the black market to wait and see how things go for the first legal growers, like the Lake County business partners. Ideally, as in the years after Prohibition, trust and market forces will bring growers out of their hideouts in vulnerable hills and forests, and onto the valley floors with the rest of California's farmers. ""The current status quo is unacceptable, and it's very damaging to the environment,"" Cuevas said. ""Any step to regulate the industry is a step in the right direction.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chris Wattie/Reuters A dealmaking boom in the marijuana sector is ramping up as excitement around legalization grows. Aurora Cannabis, one of the largest Canadian growers, bought its rival Medreleaf for a $2.3 billion stock deal, the companies announced in a joint statement on Monday. The combined firm will be the largest cannabis company by market cap, leapfrogging its chief rival, Canopy Growth. The behemoth will produce a total of 1.25 million pounds of cannabis in its facilities and will have access to the increasingly important European market. The deal is one of many to pop up in the cannabis sector in recent days. ""Merger Monday, a Wall Street adage, is back in vogue but in a new space, the cannabis sector,"" said Morgan Paxhia, Chief Investment Officer of cannabis industry-focused hedge fund Poseidon Asset Management. With the ink barely drying on the Aurora-MedReleaf deal, a consortium of four cannabis companies — Baker Technologies, Sea Hunter, Brightside, and Sante Veritas Therapeutics — announced a merger on Tuesday, operating under the name TILT. The new conglomerate will list on the CSE, a secondary Canadian exchange. Here's a rundown of the other major Monday announcements: Canopy Growth announced it would seek to list on the NYSE and begin trading shares at the end of May (pending approval), amid a wave of excitement about marijuana legalization sweeping the US. Green Thumb Industries, a Chicago-based cultivator, announced it's going public through a reverse-takeover agreement with the Toronto Stock Exchange-listed Bayswater Uranium Corporation. The new public company will list on the CSE. IAnthus, a firm that operates cannabis cultivation facilities in a number of US states, announced it received a $50 million investment from cannabis-focused private equity firm Gotham Green Partners, in the largest-ever single public investment by one investor into a cannabis company. ""We expect to see transaction activity in M&amp;A, IPOs, and private funding to continue hitting record levels as the velocity and size of capital is still relatively low but picking up meaningfully around the world,"" Paxhia said. A worker collects cuttings from a marijuana plant at the Canopy Growth Corporation facility in Smiths Falls, Ontario. Thomson Reuters The strategy behind cannabis deals Cam Battley, Aurora's Chief Corporate Officer, told Business Insider that the merger is intended to help the company make inroads into new markets. ""We didn't actually go to do this in order to achieve scale,"" Battley said. ""It was a byproduct of the strategic rationale."" Nonetheless, Battley said the merger gives Aurora everything it needs to ""rapidly expand around the world."" ""We're operating based on a very clear strategic plan that calls for both organic growth and growth by M&amp;A and for all of that to happen incredibly quickly,"" said Battley. Battley said the company is continuing to build out its 800,000 square-foot production facility near the Edmonton, Alberta airport, as well as a number of other state-of-the-art cultivation facilities in Canada and in Denmark. Aurora has also been on an acquisition spree in recent months, completing eight acquisitions and eight partnerships in the last year alone. ""The whole sector moves fast, but we move at what we call the speed of Aurora,"" Battley said. ""And no exaggeration, the entire management team works seven days a week."" This is all good news for shareholders. Each shareholder of MedReleaf will receive 3.575 shares of Aurora, equating to around 40% of the combined company. ""MedReleaf's shareholders will be getting a healthy premium,"" Vahan Ajamian, an analyst at the Toronto-based Beacon Securities said in a note. ""We believe this development will spark M&amp;A enthusiasm across the sector."" An employee cuts cannabis buds in a laboratory at the headquarters of AGES agency in Vienna, Austria March 15, 2018. REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger Why specific expertise makes for a good acquisition target In the US, tech and pharma companies that have specific expertise in the cannabis sector make for the best acquisition targets. Each of the 29 states with some form of regulated cannabis — whether medical or recreational — has its own regulations around the legal cannabis industry, creating what amounts to ""29 unique markets,"" Alex Coleman, the new CEO of TILT, told Business Insider. The Trump administration's stance toward cannabis is still unclear, though there are a number of legalization bills floating around Congress. Canada, on the other hand, is set to legalize cannabis federally this year and roll out recreational markets as early as September, pending deliberation in the Canadian Senate. ""I think you're going to be seeing more strategic acquisitions,"" Coleman said. ""I think those acquisitions will mostly be smaller in-state acquisitions with companies that have proven themselves to have some point of difference."" These acquisition targets could be companies with specific geographic expertise, or more likely smaller startups geared toward the pharmaceutical side of the industry that have patented some sort of extraction method, Coleman said. For example, if a startup came up with a treatment that could address a medical condition using certain combinations of CBD and THC (two of the most well-known active chemical compounds in cannabis) that would make the company a prime acquisition target, Coleman said. From Canada to the world Though there's lots of activity on the pharma and tech side in the US, it's the big Canadian companies that are poised to get a first-mover advantage to the global medical cannabis export market, Karan Wadhera, the managing partner of Casa Verde Capital, wrote. ""There's a very unusual situation that exists today whereby a handful of Canadian companies have an opportunity to establish and invents the global cannabis industry,"" Battley said. Canada's cannabis industry is the most mature, and Canadian companies can access capital much easier than US companies, where investors are largely reticent to jump into the industry because of the federal government's stance. While Aurora would have ""done fine"" in launching consumer brands in Canada following legalization, the big economic opportunity lies in the global medical market, Battley said. As new medical markets open up around the world, Canadian companies like Aurora will have the supply and infrastructure to export cannabis to countries in the European Union — as well as Australia, Israel, and others — as those markets open up. Battley said Aurora doesn't have any real US competitors because cannabis remains federally illegal, so US cultivators can't deduct business expenses (lest they get in trouble with the IRS), can't sell product across state lines (because of the Interstate Commerce Act), and largely can't access public exchanges.

33,Here's why export tariffs have some small business owners on edge,"As the threat of a trade war continues to loom, Main Street businesses across industries and political leanings are beginning to feel the potential ramifications.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/21/heres-why-export-tariffs-have-some-small-business-owners-on-edge.html,2018-04-21T16:04:00Z,"As the threat of a trade war continues to loom, Main Street businesses across industries and political leanings are beginning to feel the potential ramifications. div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt; For Alice Reed, a fallout with China might mean make or break for the farm that's been in her family for more than 100 years. Off the Grid! Reed's Green Growers, based in Lincoln, Nebraska, grows corn and soybeans and relies on an export partnership with China. A 25 percent tariff levied on soybeans by the world's largest economy has her on edge, at a time when she says the agricultural economy at home is already struggling. ""We are pretty afraid,"" Reed says. ""Corn prices have dropped in the past few years, and this soybean tariff will make our bottom line drop even further. It puts our family farm in peril — we will be in big trouble paying for our property taxes, paying for the seed and fertilizers. Our business will be in jeopardy."" Reed says she supported Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election cycle, fearful of what President Donald Trump's policies might mean for Main Street. As a farmer in a red state, she was outnumbered — surrounded by others who believed his ideals would revive American business. ""Now they're starting to wonder if this is really going to happen, or if we will be in big trouble,"" Reed says of her fellow farmers. ""We are a small business, we stand for American ways, and we sure hoped that he would help out the small guy instead of harming us. We are hurting down here. ""We hope he can come through and help us,"" she says of Trump. The premise of evening the playing field in trade relations was one of the reasons independent voter Jason Duff says he supported the president in 2016. The owner of Bellefontaine Ohio Properties Ltd. invests in and renovates small businesses in his company's namesake town. He felt Trump would fight for American businesses. ""My initial response to the tariffs was that I'm pleased that we're trying to balance things out. In 2017 we had a trade deficit of $375 billion with China — that's a lot of money,"" Duff said. But in the wake of the 25 percent tariffs on steel and 10 percent tariffs on aluminum the Trump administration imposed last month on certain products, Duff said he's already seeing price increases from vendors, making planning ahead more difficult. ""Our whole business is a short-term challenge. We want to see things to be fairer, we also want to see manufacturing jobs come back to places like my town in Ohio,"" he said. ""We also appreciate certainty, but right now there is greater uncertainty in the market, and it's difficult for me to plan and take initiative, and take on risk in doing future projects."" Lindsay Walters, White House deputy press secretary, said in a statement, ""China's unfair trade practices are an enormous threat to the long-term health of the American economy and they have been especially harmful to small businesses.... In the long run, the actions taken by the USTR and the President will benefit the entire U.S. economy by ending China's predatory practices, including forced technology transfer, the theft of intellectual property, and import substation policies designed to take away market share from foreigners."" Meanwhile, small business advocates have been mixed on the tariffs. The conservative lobbying group the National Federation of Independent Business found trade and exporting in particular ranked number 75 out of 75 issues polled in its latest ""Problems and Priorities"" poll from 2016. But the nonpartisan National Small Business Association and the Small Business &amp; Entrepreneurship Council have been more pointed in criticizing Trump's policies. In fact, the SBE Council recently testified before Congress urging for free trade and the ""strengthening, not undermining"" of the North American Free Trade Agreement. As the political back and forth on tariffs continues, Duff says he is watching ""every penny"" his small business spends. Back in Lincoln, Reed says they're hopeful, but bracing for the worst. ""We are hoping that things get better and that this cycle goes away instead of increases. Usually, the farm economy is the first to feel these effects, and we are going to feel it here at home,"" she says.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Urban farming provided citizens with food at a time when resources were desperately scarce. In the decades that followed, parcels of land that had been given over to allotments and city farms were gradually taken up for urban development. But recently, there has been a renewed interest in urban farming – albeit for very a different reason than before. As part of a recent research project investigating how urban farming is evolving across Europe, I found that in countries where growing food was embedded in the national culture, many people have started new food production projects. There was less uptake in countries such as Greece and Slovenia, where there was no tradition of urban farming. Yet a few community projects have recently been started in those places too. Today’s urban farmers don’t just grow food to eat; they also see urban agriculture as a way of increasing the diversity of plants and animals in the city, bringing people from different backgrounds and age groups together, improving mental and physical health and regenerating derelict neighbourhoods. Many new urban farming projects still struggle to find suitable green spaces. But people are finding inventive solutions; growing food in skips or on rooftops, on sites that are only temporarily free, or on raised beds in abandoned industrial yards. Growers are even using technologies such as hydroponics, aquaculture and aquaponics to make the most of unoccupied spaces. Something fishy Hydroponic systems were engineered as a highly space and resource efficient form of farming. Today, they represent a considerable source of industrially grown produce; one estimate suggests that, in 2016, the hydroponic vegetable market was worth about $6.9bn (£4.9bn) worldwide. Hydroponics enable people to grow food without soil and natural light, using blocks of porous material where the plants’ roots grow, and artificial lighting such as low-energy LED. A study on lettuce production found that although hydroponic crops require significantly more energy than conventionally grown food, they also use less water and have considerably higher yields. Growing hydroponic crops usually requires sophisticated technology, specialist skills and expensive equipment. But simplified versions can be affordable and easy to use. Hemmaodlat is an organisation based in Malmo, in a neighbourhood primarily occupied by low-income groups and immigrants. The area is densely built, and there’s no green space available to grow food locally. Plus, the Swedish summer is short and not always ideal for growing crops. Instead, the organisation aims to promote hydroponic systems among local communities, as a way to grow fresh food using low-cost equipment. The Bristol Fish Project is a community-supported aquaponics farm, which breeds fish and uses the organic waste they produce to fertilise plants grown hydroponically. GrowUp is another aquaponics venture located in an east London warehouse – they grow food and farm fish using only artificial light. Similarly, Growing Underground is an enterprise that produces crops in tunnels, which were originally built as air raid shelters during World War II in London. The next big thing? The potential to grow food in small spaces, under any environmental conditions, are certainly big advantages in an urban context. But these technologies also mean that the time spent outdoors, weathering the natural cycles of the seasons, is lost. Also, hydroponic systems require nutrients that are often synthesised chemically – although organic nutrients are now becoming available. Many urban farmers grow their food following organic principles, partly because the excessive use of chemical fertilisers is damaging soil fertility and polluting groundwater. To see whether these drawbacks would put urban growers off using hydroponic systems, my colleagues and I conducted a pilot study in Portsmouth. We installed small hydroponic units in two local community gardens, and interviewed volunteers and visitors to the gardens. Many of the people we spoke to were well informed about hydroponic technology, and knew that some of the vegetables sold in supermarkets today are produced with this system. Many were fascinated by the idea of growing food without soil within their community projects, but at the same time reluctant to consume the produce because of the chemical nutrients used. A few interviewees were also uncomfortable with the idea that the food was not grown naturally. We intend to repeat this experiment in the near future, to see how public opinion changes over time. And while we don’t think hydroponic systems can replace the enjoyment that growing food in soil can offer, they can save water and produce safe food, either indoors or outdoors, in a world with increasingly scarce resources. Learning to use these new technologies, and integrating them into existing projects, can only help to grow even more sustainable food. As with many technological advancements, it could be that a period of slow acceptance will be followed by rapid, widespread uptake. Perhaps the fact that Ikea is selling portable hydroponic units, while hydroponic cabinets are on the market as components of kitchen systems, is a sign that this technology is primed to enter mainstream use.

35,"Reports: Oregon has pot oversupply, Colorado hits the mark",Two of the first states to broadly legalize marijuana took different approaches to regulation that left Oregon with a vast oversupply and Colorado with a well-balanced market,https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/reports-oregon-pot-oversupply-colorado-hits-mark-57003462,2018-08-03T00:49:36Z,"Two of the first states to broadly legalize marijuana took different approaches to regulation that left Oregon with a vast oversupply and Colorado with a well-balanced market. But in both states prices for bud have plummeted. A new Oregon report by law enforcement found nearly 70 percent of the legal recreational marijuana grown goes unsold, while an unrelated state-commissioned Colorado study found most growers there are planting less than half of their legal allotment — and still meeting demand. The reports offer case studies for California and other pot-friendly states as they ramp up their legal pot industries. They also underscore some key differences in how broad legalization was handled that have helped shape differently evolving markets in each state. The Oregon study released by the Oregon-Idaho High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area — a coalition of local, state and federal agencies — includes the medical and general-use markets and the illegal market, despite gaps in data on illicit marijuana grows. It noted Oregon still has a serious problem with out-of-state trafficking and black market grows — and the top federal law enforcement officer in Oregon demanded more cooperation from state and local officials Thursday in a strident statement. ""What is often lost in this discussion is the link between marijuana and serious, interstate criminal activity. Overproduction is rampant, and the illegal transport of product out-of-state — a violation of both state and federal law — continues unchecked,"" said Billy Williams, U.S. Attorney for Oregon. ""It's time for the state to wake up, slow down and address these issues in a responsible and thoughtful manner."" The Colorado study, released Thursday, focuses on the legal, general-use market, and researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder's business school and a Denver consulting firm had access to state tracking data to produce the first-of-its-kind analysis. Colorado sales of broadly legalized marijuana began in 2014, roughly two years before Oregon allowed marijuana to be sold at non-medical retail stores. From the beginning, Colorado had stricter regulations for its growers than Oregon did. Colorado gave existing medical marijuana growers the right of first refusal for licenses, cutting down right away on a potential source of black market production. The state also requires growers to show they have sold 85 percent of their output before allowing them to expand their growing operation, said Beau Whitney, senior economist at national cannabis analytics firm New Frontier Data. ""That was the right approach, and we've made that recommendation to other state regulators to do that because if you exclude the medical folks from entering the market, then there could be propensity for diversion"" to the black market, he said. ""Colorado has done a good job in sizing the market. In Oregon, it's going to take a while for that balance to be established."" Oregon didn't give existing medical marijuana growers priority over new applicants as Colorado did, and it also didn't cap licenses. That created a perfect storm of endless licenses for all comers paired with less incentive for medical growers to enter the new industry. In June, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission, which oversees general-use marijuana, did put a pause on issuing new grow licenses to work through a monthslong backlog of applicants. The Legislature will likely consider steps to get a handle on oversupply in the 2019 session. The Pacific Northwest state also had to contend with a long-entrenched culture of illegal marijuana cultivation along its border with California, where there are near-perfect outdoor growing conditions. That tradition of illicit marijuana has created a nightmare for law enforcement agencies in rural, heavily forested counties already stretched thin by budget cuts. The Oregon report, for example, noted nearly 15,000 pounds (6,800 kilograms) of marijuana with a street value of $48 million has been seized heading to 37 other states. That doesn't include illegal pot snagged at Portland International Airport. ""I know a lot of the legal industry in Oregon has been asking for stepped-up enforcement to combat illegal operations, but there doesn't appear in those conversations a clear owner of the law enforcement,"" Whitney said. Although Colorado has been more successful in finding a balance between supply and demand, retail prices for bud, or marijuana flower, have plummeted in both states about 50 percent since 2015. That statistic could be deceiving, however, because most growers are now cultivating their crop for conversion into the increasingly popular oil extracts that wind up in everything from soaps to vape pens to edible gummies to salves. It takes 10 times more dried flower to make an oil extract and much of the dried flower is going to that market, Whitney said. ""What the report demonstrates to us is that our licensed operators are operating responsibly,"" said Mike Hartman, executive director of the Department of Revenue, which oversees marijuana regulation. ""They're not overproducing the amount of product they're putting in the marketplace. They are operating to maximize product but also... emphasizing public health and safety."" At Green Dot Labs in Boulder, CEO Alana Malone estimated the company grows about 1,600 of its allotted 1,800 plants that are used to produce cannabis oil products. As one of Colorado's oldest companies focused on producing extracts from marijuana plants, Malone said decisions about how much to plant are based on expected demand — and consumers' interest in the type of concentrate products that Green Dot Labs produces is growing. Malone said she was pleased that the Colorado study found about 32 metric tons of marijuana flower left in inventory by the end of 2017. ""That's not even close to some of the figures you see from others states,"" Malone said. ""So I'm a little bit proud of that."" ——— Flaccus and Foody are members of the AP's marijuana beat team.

36,"High-Grade Pot Jobs Have Arrived, Marijuana Industry Report Says","Marijuana industry jobs are on the rise, as are cannabis industry salaries, as cannabis market continues to grow, according to a jobs report",http://fortune.com/2018/09/27/cannabis-industry-jobs-report-growth-marijuana-market/,2018-09-27T23:14:45Z,"Jobs in legal compliance and operations management are not just careers in the white-collar world. According to a new report from Vangst, a recruitment and job placement agency focused on the cannabis industry, these are some of the most popular jobs in a growing industry: legal cannabis cultivation and retail sales management. Moreover, the cannabis industry is projected to grow 220% in 2019 alone, according to the report. Of course grow house and budtending jobs are on the rise. But as the legal marijuana industry continues to professionalize, jobs in finance, compliance, and operations are also opening up, with a staggering 690% increase in overall marijuana industry job listings between January 1, 2017 and August 1, 2018. Many of those jobs listed were offered under titles such as director of cultivation or director of extraction. And, average salaries in the industry grew 16.8% between 2017 and 2018. That’s a lot of green. It’s worth pointing out that many director-level jobs require complex training and knowledge that is fairly common in other industries. Consider compliance managers, tasked with maintaining an understanding of complex state and federal laws. And finance directors in the cannabis industry have a problem unique to few other legal industries: most marijuana growers and sellers are still not allowed to bank with most major financial institutions, which fear running afoul of guidelines about aiding what is still considered criminal activity on the federal level. The study and salary ranges reported was based on data compiled from 1,200 cannabis companies around the country, as well as Vangst’s own internal data from several years of staffing the cannabis industry. It makes sense that marijuana industry jobs would be growing, given how quickly cannabis has been legalized across the United States in recent years. Medical marijuana is now legal in 30 U.S. states, and the legal marijuana market size is even catching up with beer and wine sales, thanks mostly to recreational marijuana use, which is legal in nine states. Legal marijuana sales were projected to hit $10 billion in the U.S. in 2017. It seems all but certain in his growing industry, that estimate will be met and well exceeded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,Unions high on organizing California pot workers,Golden State's legalization of recreational marijuana on Jan. 1 seen as golden opportunity to organize new labor pool,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/labor-unions-see-growth-potential-in-california-pot-workers/,2017-12-25T19:29:50Z,"GOSHEN, CALIFORNIA — Unions have caught a whiff of a rare opportunity to organize a whole new set of workers as recreational marijuana becomes legal in California. The United Farm Workers, Teamsters and United Food and Commercial Workers are looking to unionize the tens of thousands of potential workers involved in the legal weed game, from planters to rollers to sellers. The move could provide a boost to organized labor's lagging membership — if infighting doesn't get in the way. The United Farm Workers, co-founded by iconic labor leader Cesar Chavez, says organizing an industry rooted in agriculture is a natural fit, and growers could label their products with the union's logo as a marketing strategy. ""If you're a cannabis worker, the UFW wants to talk with you,"" national vice president Armando Elenes said. But United Food and Commercial Workers, which represents grocery store employees, meat packers and retail workers, registered its intent to organize cannabis workers across the country. ""We would hope they respect our jurisdiction,"" UFCW spokesman Jeff Ferro said. Teamsters organizer Kristin Heidelbach said there's no need for unions to battle each other. There will be plenty of workers needing representation as small cannabis businesses run by ""happy stoner"" types give way to large pharmaceutical corporations, she said. The green rush that begins in 2018 is an opportunity for unions to regain influence that began declining in the late 1950s, said David Zonderman, a professor of labor history at North Carolina State University. But discord between unions could upend it. As could resistance from cannabis business leaders. ""Are they going to be new-age and cool with it,"" Zonderman said, ""or like other businesspeople, say, 'Heck, no. We're going to fight them tooth and nail?'"" Last year, California voters approved sales of recreational marijuana to those 21 and older at licensed shops beginning Jan. 1. Cannabis in California already is a $22 billion industry, including medical marijuana and a black market that accounts for most of that total, according to University of California at Davis agriculture economist Philip Martin. Medical marijuana has been legal since 1996, when California was the first state to approve such a law. Labor leaders estimate recreational pot in California could employ at least 100,000 workers from the north coast to the Sierra Nevada foothills and the San Joaquin Valley, harvesting and trimming the plants, extracting ingredients to put in liquids and edibles, and driving it to stores and front doors. Other pot workers have organized in other states, but California should be especially friendly territory for unions, said Jamie Schau, a senior analyst with Brightfield Group, which does marketing analysis on the marijuana industry. The state has one of the nation's highest minimum wages and the largest number of unionized workers across industries. Its laws also tend to favor employees. At least some workers say they're open to unions. ""I'm always down to listen to what could be a good deal for me and my family,"" said Thomas Grier, 44, standing behind the counter at Canna Can Help Inc., a dispensary in the Central Valley community of Goshen. The dispensary — with $7 million in yearly sales — sells medical marijuana. Called a ""bud tender,"" Grier recently waited on a steady flow of regular customers walking through the door to pick out their favorite strain. He said so far, no unions have contacted him. Grier gets along with his boss and said he doesn't want to pay union dues for help ironing out workplace disputes. But he hasn't discounted the possibility of joining. After recently entering the marijuana industry, Los Angeles resident Richard Rodriguez said one sticky traffic stop three months ago converted him into a ""hard core"" Teamster. He'd never been in a union until this year. Rodriguez said an officer pulled him over delivering a legal shipment of pot and detained him for 12 hours as he was accused of following too closely behind a semi-truck. A union lawyer stepped in, and Rodriguez said he was released without being arrested or given a ticket. ""Most companies can't or are unwilling to do that,"" he said, ""because employees are easily replaced.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,Need farming tools? Vancouver Island lending library aims to help local growers,"A new lending library is coming to Vancouver Island, but instead of offering books or other typical rental items, it will hand out farming equipment.",http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/north-cowichan-farming-tool-lending-library-1.4686386,2018-06-02T21:00:00Z,"A new lending library is coming to Vancouver Island but instead of offering books or other typical rental items, it'll be handing out farming equipment. North Cowichan council has promised a grant of $15,000 to help establish the agricultural equipment lending library to help with local food production. Mayor John Lefebure says he supports the program because it fits with the city's climate goals. ""We have a climate action and energy plan that was created and adopted by council in 2013,"" Lefebure said. ""In it, one of the goals is to support locally grown food."" The hope is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that come from the transportation of food, he told Gregor Craigie, the host of CBC's On The Island. The council funding is coming from a reserve fund, set aside to support municipal projects focused on reducing energy use and emissions. Agricultural tools of all kinds, from rototillers to tractors, are on the list of items needed by small-scale farmers. ""We have a lot of small acreage farmers, down as small as a couple of acres, who can actually be very successful with more intensive farming,"" Lefebure said. ""[It's] the kind of tools that are not necessarily available at tool rental companies."" The program is being put together by the Cowichan Green Community and is expected to be underway by next year's planting season. The environmental sustainability non-profit organization is continuing to seek additional funding and grants for the project.

39,Farmers send livestock to slaughter early due to drought,Farmers are sending livestock to slaughter early as the lack of rain leaves pastures dry.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45018746,2018-07-31T23:06:33Z,"Image copyright Abi Reader Dairy farmer Abi Reader has already sent four milking cows to slaughter and she's planning to send four more as the cost of feeding them soars. The record summer heatwave has put huge pressure on farmers like her. Meat and milk producers, like salad and vegetable growers, say it is having a ""crippling impact"". Their concerns are on the agenda at a ""drought summit"" where the president of the National Farmers' Union will meet government representatives. The NFU says it is ""seeking urgent action"" to address the impact of the dry weather, despite heavy rain in recent days, which has provided some potential relief. Representatives of farming organisations, The Environment Agency, Natural England, the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) and farming charities RABI and Farming Community Network are expected to meet Secretary of State for the environment Michael Gove to discuss how to mitigate the impact on food producers. Already farmers growing lettuce, peas and carrots have warned of shortages if the hot weather continues. The forecast is for high temperatures to return on Friday. For livestock farmers the lack of rain means animals can't just be put out to pasture as usual. Near Cardiff in Wales, where Abi Reader farms her 180-strong milking herd, grass is usually green and lush throughout the summer, she says, but the heat has dried it to a crisp yellow. It's costing her £210 a day to keep them fed using silage and hay. ""We're breaking into winter stocks, that's the frightening thing,"" she says. It doesn't make economic sense to feed so many. So they're ""shedding passengers"" - cutting down the number of mouths by sending cows to slaughter that would in better circumstances have continued milking. Two were cows that aborted calves due to the stress of the hot weather. ""We've lost a lot of money on them. The cheapest option is get rid of them and cut our losses,"" she says. Image copyright Abi Reader Image caption In April Abi Reader's fields were ""green and lush"" she says Image copyright Abi Reader Image caption By July the fields were dry and not providing enough nutrients for her herd Ms Reader says she's not the only farmer taking this course of action. It was hard to find a slot for them in abattoir, she says. John O'Farrell, who runs an abattoir in Camarthenshire, Wales, says many farmers are culling animals earlier than they would normally, following a bad grass growing season due to the harsh weather in March, which delayed the start of outdoor grazing, followed by the heatwave. ""Our volume of work is considerably higher than we would expect at this time of year,"" he told BBC Radio Four's Farming Today programme. ""Farmers are taking the view if the animals are to be culled it's best to cull early."" The same factors are having an impact on beef and sheep herds too, according to Nick Allen from the British Meat Processors Association. ""The first thing we noticed was people sending lambs in for slaughter at slightly lighter weights than normal,"" he says. ""The moment they're running out of grass on the farm they get rid of them earlier."" He says if farmers go into winter short of feed and relying on expensive concentrates it will push up costs and could result in lower overall production of UK meat and milk. ""It could translate into meat being in shorter supply and prices having to go up because the cost of production is going to have to go up, without a shadow of a doubt,"" he added. At Wednesday's meeting, National Farmers' Union president Minette Batters will raise a range of issues resulting from the lack of rainfall. She will say the weather has created ""extra volatility and pressures"" on farmers and will discuss what can be done to help mitigate the impact of the ongoing heatwave in particular in terms of ensuring water supplies to farms. The NFU would like to see more flexibility for farmers to apply for a licence from the Environment Agency to take water from rivers to irrigate crops. It would also like to see more opportunities for access to public supply water when there is spare capacity in the system. ""I know many areas of the country experienced thunderstorms and heavy rain last weekend, said Ms Batters. ""Unfortunately, that hasn't mitigated the many issues farmers are experiencing currently from availability of water and lack of forage and feed,"" she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,Truffle economy: how a UK scientist sniffed out a culinary opportunity,The prized fungus has has long proved difficult to grow outside its natural habitat — until now,https://www.ft.com/content/db8ba2ea-4298-11e8-93cf-67ac3a6482fd,2018-04-20T09:47:00Z,"Late one winter afternoon, in a field near Edinburgh, a scientist and a hunter are standing over a springer spaniel, watching it tear furiously at the base of a tree. Every few seconds, the dog ceases its digging, reaches down with its mouth and shakes a clod of earth as if it were a small mammal between its jaws. After a few minutes, the hunter, a retiree called Joyce, raises her hand and makes a circle gesture to the spaniel, Maxwell. “Snuffle,” she says. “Go snuffle the truffle.” And Maxwell takes off, whipping through the trees. For Maxwell and Joyce, truffle hunting is a new pastime. A few centuries ago, truffles, the fruiting bodies of fungi that grow underground on the roots of trees, were everywhere. In her 1861 Book of Household Management, Mrs Beeton included a recipe that involved the stewing of 12 truffles in champagne. But since the 19th century, the number of wild truffles has declined. These days, epicures may have tried an Italian or French truffle, or sampled truffle oil, truffle salt or truffle honey. But to most, the UK’s indigenous truffle — Tuber aestivum, a variety that has black skin, nobbled with pyramid-shaped warts — is virtually unknown. British truffles tend to receive more muted praise than their European counterparts. The food writer Josh Ozersky described the aroma of Italian white truffles as “a combination of newly ploughed soil, fall rain, burrowing earthworms, and the pungent memory of lost youth and old love affairs”. “Nutty” is the way British truffles are often described. Farming truffles has long been regarded as a fool’s errand. Humankind has devised ways of cultivating almost every desirable plant, fruit and fungus, yet the truffle has, on the whole, resisted efforts to tame it. In spite of this they are highly prized by chefs, and a fixture on Michelin-star menus as shavings on salads, pasta and risottos. It is thought that demand for the best truffle species outstrips supply by a factor of 10 — supply is limited because they are so hard to grow and wild stocks are depleted — and this is reflected in their price, which has increased by four or five per cent each year for the past three decades. In 2014, a 4.16lb white truffle was auctioned in New York for $61,250. In the field with Joyce and Maxwell is Paul Thomas, a scientist who has made the study of this elusive fungus his life’s work, and the growing of them his business. Thomas is not the first person to recognise the truffle’s commercial potential. However, unlike his predecessors, he seems to have found a way to reliably cultivate them outside their native habitat of France, Italy and Spain. He has spent years in the lab perfecting a method of artificially inoculating saplings so that when the trees mature, truffles will grow on them. Over the past decade he has been planting in orchards in England, Wales and Scotland, all places where summer truffles can be foraged in the woods but have not before been farmed. Paul Thomas assesses a truffle site © Sophie Gerrard As Maxwell makes a beeline for a hazel tree, Thomas explains that the plantation is 20 acres, totalling about 11,000 trees. Planted seven years ago, it began to produce truffles in 2016, a few years earlier than Thomas had expected — he had thought that the harsh Scottish climate might temper growth. When the orchard reaches maturity in about six years, he is expecting it to produce half a tonne of truffles a season. Online, 100g of summer truffles costs approximately £85. Thomas, who is 37, has spent much of the day working to fit four trees with dendrometers, devices that measure micro-variations in tree trunks. “They’re so precise, you can see water going up and down the stem in a day,” he says. He has also installed soil temperature and moisture sensors underground. Data are being logged for a year for comparison to truffle yields. Eventually he hopes to understand the precise conditions required for fruiting. At the moment, it is more educated guesswork. Maxwell © Sophie Gerrard At the hazel tree, Maxwell is snuffling with urgency. Thomas borrows Joyce’s vanghetto, a truffle-digging tool that is something between a trowel and a pickaxe. He scrapes back the soil, exposing threadlike roots. Watching Thomas work, Joyce is sceptical. Though Maxwell unearthed a truffle a few weeks earlier, it is out of season — summer truffles typically stop fruiting in December. It is possible that the dog smells a very young, as yet unformed truffle, or one that is rotting in the ground. But she suspects he is bored. “He doesn’t know he’s looking for truffles,” Joyce says. “He thinks that if he indicates where there’s a smell, suddenly, magically, Mum gives him his tennis ball.” The spaniel, snout glistening with mud, seems suspiciously fixated on Joyce’s coat pocket. After a couple of minutes of digging, Thomas gives up. Today there will be no truffles. Since ancient times, truffles have been a vaunted yet mysterious delicacy. Plutarch thought that they arose from a combination of a lightning strike, warmth and water, while the Italian composer Rossini claimed to have wept three times in his life: “Once when my first opera failed. Once again, the first time I heard Paganini play the violin. And once when a truffled turkey fell overboard at a boating picnic.” In recent years, scientists have identified some 185 different species belonging to the tuber genus growing on almost every continent. Some are as small as peas, others the size of oranges. Desert truffles grow on the roots of shrubs in north Africa and the Middle East and can be eaten like baked potatoes. The Chinese black truffle, T. indicum, is almost indistinguishable from black European truffles in appearance, but it lacks flavour and is fed to livestock. White Alba truffles are particularly expensive because they are only found in the wild, but chefs believe black Périgords ( T. melanosporum ) are superior in flavour. In France, truffle poaching has become so common that during high season, in late winter, the police set up roadblocks. Truffle dogs are at risk of being poisoned or stolen. A Périgord truffle grown in Wales Truffles are formed when a fungus sends out the gossamer-fine tubes of its mycelium into the soil to meld with the feeder roots of trees. The fungus lives in a symbiosis with the tree, feeding it nutrients from the soil and receiving, in return, sugar via photosynthesis. After six years, if mating has occurred, the mycelium swells, forming a bulbous, spore-carrying fruit body: the truffle. Unlike the fruit of other fungi, such as white mushrooms, which grow above ground, truffles rely on being dug out and eaten, their spores disseminated by insects and mammals. They attract animals by expelling a powerful odour and are so delicious that animals keep digging. For a long time, pigs were used to hunt for truffles but about 50 years ago they fell out of favour. Pigs have good noses but poor self-restraint. I thought, hey, this stuff is expensive and it’s addictive. I wonder if you can grow it? Robert Chang, co-founder American Truffle Company People started trying to farm truffles by more scientific methods in the 19th century. In 1808, a Frenchman called Joseph Talon grew Périgords from acorns he had collected from truffle-producing oak trees. Yet the methodology was inexact: seedlings from truffle trees did not always yield truffles. In 1970, Gérard Chevalier and Jean Grente, scientists at France’s Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA), developed a way to reliably inoculate the seeds of trees so that they carried the truffle fungus. The first commercialised truffle saplings were sold in 1973. Today, about 90 per cent of France’s Périgords are grown in orchards. But the French plantations, along with those of Italy and Spain, do not produce enough truffles. Since the 19th century, production in France has fallen from 1,000 tonnes a season to 30 tonnes, according to Claude Murat of the INRA. The decline is attributed to changes in agriculture and warming temperatures, with prolonged drought depleting wild stocks. (Cultivated truffles are less vulnerable to climate change because they can be irrigated.) While artificially inoculated seedlings grow well in the truffles’ indigenous Mediterranean habitat, with its limestone-heavy soil, trying to plant truffle trees overseas has generally not resulted in truffles (except in Australia, where there have been thriving truffle plantations since the 1990s). Hazel trees at the Edinburgh plantation © Sophie Gerrard Thomas first encountered a truffle while he was working on his PhD at Sheffield University. As an undergraduate, he had read a 1997 paper by the Canadian ecologist Suzanne Simard about how different plant species communicate underground in vast mycorrhizal networks sometimes referred to as the “wood wide web”. After reading more deeply about truffle biology, he ordered a Périgord online. “I opened the packet and it flooded the house with aroma and scented everything in the fridge,” he says. “The next morning the orange juice tasted like truffle.” Thomas thought he might try to grow a truffle at home. He found that while the methods for inoculating seedlings were more or less robust, there was scarce information on how to ensure fruiting happened. He suspected that this was the reason why there was such a high rate of failure among truffle growers. “There was one group I was reading about where a guy was pouring milk round the base of his trees and he was producing truffles, and all the other growers were like: ‘Oh, we’ll pour milk around our trees too,’” he says. For a long time, pigs were used to hunt for truffles but about 50 years ago they fell out of favour. Pigs have good noses but poor self-restraint Thomas began publishing papers on subjects such as the effect of climate and the role of soil pH on truffle growth. In 2006, he received an email from Robert Chang, a former Yahoo executive and an early investor in Renren, the New York Stock Exchange-listed Chinese social network. Chang, who lives near San Francisco, had first eaten truffles, shaved on top of tagliatelle tossed in butter, in Munich a few years earlier. “I thought, hey, this stuff is expensive and it’s addictive,” Chang tells me. “I wonder if you can grow it?” The science of growing truffles, he found, was not in the public domain. He looked for someone who was actively doing research and flew to London to meet Thomas in a pub near Leicester Square. “A one-hour meeting turned into a four-hour meeting.” Chang and Thomas resolved to do things their own way. Rather than selling inoculated trees from their nursery, which is in Oregon, directly to growers, they would partner with clients, providing fungus-loaded saplings at near cost, as well as expertise, technical support and product distribution as the plantation matured, for free. (They declined to go into details about their inoculation process as their method is not patented.) In return, their firm, the American Truffle Company, would take about one-third of the profits once the plantation started fruiting. “All of a sudden that changes the incentives very significantly,” Chang says. “We are very much invested in making sure that our client-partners actually produce truffles and produce as many truffles as their land will support.” Hazel trees © Sophie Gerrard The company begins by analysing a prospective site’s soil and climate to ensure the natural conditions are favourable. Lime can be added if the soil is too acidic. Périgords will grow up and down the west coast of the US — Thomas and Chang have a number of plantations in the Napa Valley — but on the east coast they will not survive north of Delaware. Burgundy truffles, a woodland species, are suited to the Eastern Seaboard. Chang estimates the cost of establishing a truffle orchard is between $15,000 and $25,000 per acre, depending on the species and specifics like whether a deer fence is needed. The company has planted between 150 and 200 acres in the US. No truffles have yet surfaced but Chang is confident they are on the cusp of this happening. At the moment, the majority of Périgord and burgundy truffles consumed in the US come from France. Chang estimates that domestic truffles can be sold at between a 15 and 30 per cent premium over imports due to their freshness. (Once out the ground, truffles rapidly lose pungency.) The company plans to stop establishing new plantations soon, he says, because they do not wish to create an oversupply, tanking prices. I ask whether he is concerned that rival companies might follow their lead anyway, swamping the market. “Certainly people can start truffle orchards and people will continue to start truffle orchards, but the vast majority of them have failed and will continue to fail, simply because the science will not become publicly available any time soon,” he says. “Whoever controls the science will control the supply.” On a drizzly morning in February, I go to the University of East Anglia in Norwich to meet the scientists who are working with Thomas on ways to improve truffle farming. Arasu Ganesan is a professor of chemical biology who specialises in epigenetics, the study of how chemical reactions in organisms influence the genome. “There’s a big drop between how many trees you inoculate and how many actually produce a truffle,” he says when we get to the lab. Blooms of fungi in shades of charcoal, ochre and moss green sit in Petri dishes. Truffle fungus, Ganesan says, is “like a black box which nobody understands”. One mystery is what prompts truffle fungi to mate. Scientists know that they have two mating types (some fungal species have as many as 13). The maternal mating type is the one that forms the symbiosis with the tree root and the paternal type is present in the soil (though both can function in either role). “We’ve gone through this complicated differentiation between the sexes,” says Ganesan. “Theirs is complete equality.” The big question for the scientists is whether one mating type is more common than another. The dominance of one type on a plantation is problematic because it would likely impact the efficiency of mating and, in turn, truffle yield. “If we create trees that contain only one or the other mating type, they could be distributed in a logical way through the plantation to facilitate mating,” says Philip Schuler, a PhD student and UEA’s resident authority on truffle mating habits. The scientists are also analysing compounds that occur naturally in the soil to see if any have properties that might be useful. If they manage to find a chemical, say, that encourages truffles to mate it could be made into a fertiliser. Not long after visiting Scotland, I telephone the owner of one of the UK’s oldest truffle plantations, this time in Wales. Matt Sims, who works in precious metals, turned to truffles because he did not know what else to do with his spare 11 acres. “I needed to do something with the land that was low maintenance and with a potential nice return,” he says. After reading a few books on truffles, he got in touch with Paul Thomas. Over the winter of 2008-09, Sims and Thomas planted 5,000 hazels and oaks inoculated with summer truffle fungus. Eight years later, Sims and his dogs found their first batch. Since then, he has found about 150 specimens that he has sold mostly to restaurants. This season, he expanded to sell directly to consumers through his website, the Welsh Truffle Company. “At the moment only about 35 trees are fruiting,” he says. “The year before only three were fruiting. So if the trend continues I’m expecting about 300 to fruit this year, and 3,000 the year after.” Managing a truffle orchard that size, he admits, would not be the low-maintenance money-spinner he had planned for in the beginning. Lobster mac’n’cheese with black truffle – as served by London’s 34 Mayfair restaurant © Sim Canetty-Clarke/34 Mayfair In the middle of his orchard, Sims is running a small experiment. There, among the hazels, he has planted four Mediterranean oak saplings that have been inoculated with Périgord fungus. This was against Thomas’s advice. The Périgord’s ecological range was assumed to be limited to chalky soils with a climate a good deal balmier than that of Wales; the furthest north they had been found was Lorraine in France. But in March last year, one of Sims’s dogs unearthed a ripe Périgord, a high-quality specimen weighing 16g. Sims had anticipated its arrival because the vegetation around the base of the tree had died, indicating that the fungus below was thriving. Since then, he has found a dozen more. Much of England and Wales has a similar soil profile and climate to Sims’s site, raising the possibility that one day there could be a trade in British-grown Périgords. For now, there are just the four trees.

41,‘Pot stocks’ boom as investors eye vast expansion,Next month’s legalisation of cannabis for recreational use in Canada helps to spur growth,https://www.ft.com/content/40d63b4c-b76a-11e8-b3ef-799c8613f4a1,2018-09-14T10:02:10Z,"As the prospect of a legal marijuana industry across North America looms, retail and professional investors are proving to be enthusiastic buyers as they anticipate explosive growth for the sector. The excitement around so-called pot stocks has been generated by next month’s legalisation of cannabis for recreational use in Canada, as well as by a swath of M&amp;A among cannabis producers and investments by major drinks companies in the growers. The promise of a vastly expanded market and an aura of legitimacy has drawn cash from big investors across the globe. Analysts at BDS Analytics estimate global spending on the drug could hit $32bn by 2022, a sharp rise from the current $9.5bn. “All the big beverage and tobacco firms are talking about this,” said Nikolaas Faes, equity analyst at Bryan Garnier &amp; Co. “They’re all trying to figure out how this is going to hurt their industry.” Canadian medical marijuana producer Canopy Growth Corporation, which trades on the Toronto stock exchange under the ticker WEED, is the largest of the handful of companies to have benefited from the investor excitement. Constellation Brands, which makes Corona and Modelo beers, raised their stake in Canopy to 38 per cent with a $4bn investment last month, the largest investment made in the growing industry to date. Mr Faes said the growth of the marijuana industry could present an opportunity for the big beverage and tobacco companies too. “What do beer and tobacco and cannabis do? They intoxicate you, they’re a social lubricant — they’re in the same business.” Jesse Pytlak, equity analyst at Cormark Securities, said the Constellation investment was the main trigger for the recent share price rally, demonstrating a “serious commitment” to the marijuana sector by a Fortune 500 company. Over the past 12 months, shares in Cronos Group have risen more than 400 per cent, with Aurora up 210 per cent and Aphria up 190 per cent. The Constellation deal is not the only driver, though. Earlier in the summer, Aurora Cannabis bought rival medical marijuana group MedReleaf in a $2.5bn deal, having already snapped up CanniMed Therapeutics five months previously and invested in the public listing of The Green Organic Dutchman. Behind the Money podcast: Following the cannabis money trail Another key factor for the industry is the opening up of the US market. About half of the states in the country allow cannabis to be used for medicinal purposes, while nine states, including California, Colorado, Massachusetts and Washington DC, allow people to use it recreationally. In July, Canadian producer Tilray became the first cannabis producer to carry out an initial public offering in New York, closing 32 per cent up from its listing price. “The legalisation in Canada is clearly one factor driving investment, but it’s more about the US market,” said Mr Faes. Mr Pytlak said investors were now beginning to better understand the regulatory environment in the US, where companies are currently unallowed to transport the drug across state lines. Nevertheless, food and drink analysts envisage a rapidly maturing market that could see various strains of the plant laced through consumer goods ranging from soap to coffee and sports drinks. Linda Gilbert, managing director of consumer insights for BDS Analytics, said there were lots of opportunities to use cannabis as a new ingredient in existing food and drinks. “If we look at the cannabis plant, or hemp or marijuana, there are hundreds of different cannabinoids that could become new flavours or aromas for a beverage.” “The bottom line is that cannabis is not new, people have been consuming cannabis for centuries. What’s new is legal cannabis,” said Ms Gilbert. “It’s very rare for an entirely new category of product to become an investment opportunity.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42,Meet Nova Scotia's 3 legal cannabis growers,There's a bumper crop of marijuana being legally grown at three facilities in rural Nova Scotia. And there are several other new facilities being built as cannabis production is ramping up in the province.,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/three-ns-cannabis-producers-now-legally-harvesting-pot-1.4682143,2018-05-30T10:00:00Z,"It might sound like a setup line to a joke. What do an old slaughterhouse, an empty Bowater building and a former military facility all have in common? The punchline: All three are now being used to grow cannabis in Nova Scotia — the start of what the farmers say will be a bumper crop in three communities. In the Wentworth Valley, there are hundreds of plants in various stages of growth at Breathing Green Solutions. The operations manager, Joe Sanford, says the old North American Aerospace Defense Command facility came up in a private sale about five years ago. It took more than two years to retrofit the old building, but thanks to its military history, the site came fenced in and with two security gates. The company's taken other measures to secure its product — and meet regulations; there are about 150 security cameras on the property and staff need security cards to move from room to room inside. Different-sized plants fill each room; small ones are packed into a humidified area, while those standing half a metre tall are reaching maturation in a larger space. Down another hallway, t he most mature plants can be found, standing two metres high and covered with buds that are ready for harvest. 3 N.S. companies with Health Canada licence The company is the first of three in Nova Scotia to receive a cultivation licence from Health Canada. On the South Shore, Aqualitas is now growing cannabis in an old Bowater Paper Products warehouse in Brooklyn, Queens County, and Highland Grow has set up in a converted slaughterhouse in East Ohio, Antigonish County. Although there's still debate about the exact date cannabis will be legalized, it's clear the race is on for these growers to get to the next level of licensing from Health Canada — the licence to sell. And all three say they're getting close. Next step: licence to sell ""In order to receive a final sales licence, we have to produce two full crops of product,"" Sanford said. ""We'll have to dry that product, package it, send it off for testing."" Then, they wait for Health Canada's approval. Breathing Green has a dozen employees. Its master grower, Bruce Cormier, worked in the cannabis industry in British Columbia for two decades. ""I'm really happy with the growth of our plants,"" Cormier said, standing among a crop of metre-high plants. He estimates they'll each yield about 450 grams of pot. Aqualitas and Highland Grow are also in their second grow cycles and hope to soon send samples to Health Canada to get their sales licence. Aqualitas uses an aquaponic growing platform that combines horticulture and aquaculture. By using fish waste from 1,300 live koi fish, the company says its cultivation process requires 50 per cent less energy and 90 per cent less water than the average operation. CEO Myrna Gillis says the company uses neither synthetic chemicals nor pesticides. ""We utilize live fish and use their outputs to provide the nutrients to the plants in a closed-loop system that recirculates,"" she said. Aqualitas has more than 30 people on its payroll. Gillis said when the company finishes its 25,000-square-foot expansion, the number of employees could rise to 100. Frank MacMaster, president and master grower at Highland Grow, said he was ""lucky"" to secure a cultivation licence. He recently sold the Antigonish County operation to Biome, a Canadian company that plans on running licensed cannabis production facilities. They have a dozen employees, including a recent hire whose resumé includes director of food safety for Sobeys and director of quality assurance at Oxford Frozen Foods. ""We want to provide people with good-paying jobs,"" MacMaster said. ​Employment opportunities And with the advent of the green market, there are other Nova Scotia firms looking for financing and licensing. The Truro Herbal Company has yet to get its cultivation licence, but its vice-president of strategy says the company is almost done construction on where it hopes to begin growing. ""We've really picked up steam in the last four to six months,"" Sandy Schembri said. ""We're anticipating beginning our first phase test grow in about six weeks."" Truro Herbal Company was the first business group to announce publicly that it planned to grow and sell cannabis in Nova Scotia. But it's been years in the making. ""Our application goes back to the summer of 2014 and the timeline really shows the burden and the rigour of the Health Canada application process,"" Schembri said. Other companies are building growing operations in industrial parks in Windsor, Kentville and Lower Sackville. AtlantiCann Medical Inc. is building a new facility on Estates Road in Lower Sackville. Company president Christine Halef has a background in pharmacy and her family is among a group of well-known developers in Halifax. 'Good-paying jobs' Two other companies have applied for building permits in Halifax Regional Municipality to construct growing operations — one in the Burnside Industrial Park and another in the Eastern Shore community of Pleasant Harbour. And in Stellarton, cannabis giant Zenabis has extensively renovated the Clairtone factory, which used to produce high-end stereos. The company already has licensed grow facilities in Atholville, N.B. and Delta, B.C. ""We are still confident licensing will happen here,"" Stellarton Mayor Danny MacGillivray said. ""This would mean a lot for this area — not just jobs, but good-paying jobs."" NSLC plan Health Canada will not provide the names of the companies from Nova Scotia that are seeking licences. The department did confirm, however, that there are 14 active licence applications in the province. Thirteen applications have already been rejected. Once the pot regulations change in Canada, cannabis will be sold at certain Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation outlets in Nova Scotia. But unless the three legal cultivators in this province earn their sales licences soon, they will initially be shut out of providing local pot to the Crown corporation. ""The lines of communication are open between the NSLC and local suppliers and we have met with them to explain our approach to cannabis and our requirements,"" NSLC spokesperson Bev Ware said. ""We plan on initiating a followup market call once we have some sales history and once we know there is locally produced product available."" The NSLC estimates it will need 15,000 kilograms a year to keep its shelves stocked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,Barossa Valley: Why this Adelaide escape is becoming Australia's new foodie hub,"The restaurants of South Australia’s pastoral Barossa Valley don’t simply post menus online. Instead, they post food philosophies, love letters to seasonal vegetables and friendly lectures on the virtues of sustainable eating.",http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/ausandpacific/barossa-valley-wine-wineries-adelaide-accommodation-restaurants-australia-foodie-hub-why-a8095256.html,2017-12-08T10:33:30Z,"The restaurants of South Australia’s pastoral Barossa Valley don’t simply post menus online. Instead, they post food philosophies, love letters to seasonal vegetables and friendly lectures on the virtues of sustainable eating. An hour’s drive north-east of Adelaide, the area built its reputation as an exceptional wine country long ago, specialising in full-bodied reds from grapes first planted by German settlers. But spurred by a state campaign that launched three years ago to emphasise the region’s reputation for heritage breed livestock and “minimal intervention” produce, the Barossa has been quickly solidifying a magnificent culinary reputation, too. Inspiration here is abundant. The Barossa’s beautiful green hills are the ideal place for grazing sheep, for dining alfresco next to adoringly tended herb gardens and for photogenic chefs whose hobbies likely include pickling foraged garlic scapes (the flower bud of the plant) and plucking just-ripe plums off roadside trees. Australia's new foodie hub, the Barossa Valley Just as Thomas Keller forever changed the dining landscape of California’s Napa Valley when he opened French Laundry in 1994, the Barossa is now home to Australian chefs and restaurants who are helping shape a broader national culinary project. The region’s charming, hyper-committed food culture is part of a new “modern Australian” cuisine that’s rooted less in specific technique or tradition, and more in superb local and indigenous produce. But it wasn’t always so. When chef Lachlan Colwill opened a restaurant at Hentley Farm winery in 2012, he was told that fine dining would never work in the sleepy Barossa. His restaurant, which has a focus on ingredients collected from the surrounding hillsides, has been so successful that he’s drafting plans to add a small boutique hotel to the site. Nearby FermentAsian, widely considered to have Australia’s best wine list, combines Vietnamese and Thai food traditions with ingredients sourced from the owners’ home garden – for example, South Australian squid with sorrel and coriander pesto. And Appellation at The Louise, the first luxury vineyard retreat and destination restaurant known for farm-to-table dining, was recently added to the prestigious Relais &amp; Châteaux network thanks to its ingredient-focused dishes like a terrine of red beets with goat’s curd, dill and walnut vinaigrette. Wealthy Australians, I’ve been told, sometimes fly in from Melbourne and Sydney – 500 and 800 miles respectively – just to eat dinner at one of the Barossa Valley’s increasingly famous locavore restaurants. “The Barossa is breaking out of the reputation as shiraz country,” says Pete Little, manager of Harvest Kitchen. “People know a lot more about the food now and they’re asking more questions.” Little says consumer interest has become highly focused: “They want to hear the stories, down to the winemaker’s dog’s name. If you’re not using local, seasonal produce, you’re on the fringes.” Even Beans and Cream, the local coffee shop in the tiny town of Tanunda, serves cold brew with high-fat non-homogenised milk from the Adelaide Hills. The Barossa’s restaurants source from closed flock ducks (where no adults are introduced to the flock, in a bid to keep them healthier) and minimal-spray fruits and vegetables. Seasonal produce comes and goes in just days here, and the food scene is driven by the relationship between speciality producers and the growing ranks of chefs. The Barossa Valley Cheese Company – cow and goat milk cheeses handmade by a former winemaker – recently more than doubled the size of its storefront to accommodate demand. Meanwhile, the much loved Barossa Farmer’s Market, which operates on Saturday mornings, has become one of South Australia’s premiere culinary destinations, with finicky chefs queuing for the best cherries, honey, oyster mushrooms and micro greens. Local sourcing, an embarrassment of riches, has become an obsession for many. “I used to play golf to clear my head,” says Little. “But now I forage for wild mushrooms.” Saskia Beer – daughter to TV chef and Barossa trailblazer Maggie Beer – recently returned to the area to breed heritage pigs and fowl. At Farmhouse, the mother-daughter duo sell everything from local jams and olive oils to free-range chickens and smoked meats, and provide a fair-trade marketplace for small, independent producers. But Hentley Farm might be the Barossa’s most charming example of hyper-seasonal dining. Colwill offers about 20 menu items at any given time, and about 60 per cent of the menu changes from week to week, depending on what’s good. Marron, a local shellfish similar to crayfish, might reach peak sweetness for four weeks at the most, while the much prized local asparagus might only last a single day. (One year, sheep got into the asparagus patch and that was that – much to the disheartenment of the local culinary community.) “They’ve been growing and cooking with these ingredients for generations and good, honest produce is just part of the legacy here,” Colwill says about the Barossa’s foodie heritage. And then he says, warmly: “I grew up on a farm with orchards, chickens and quails, but Barossa growers are the most judgemental farmers I’ve ever met.” Travel essentials Getting there Qantas flies to Adelaide from Heathrow via Dubai and Sydney from around £780 return. From there, Barossa is an hour's drive. Staying there The Louise has doubles from A$585 (£326), B&amp;B.

Adults over the age of 21 can buy up to an ounce of marijuana and grow as many as six plants at home without a doctor's letter. California has issued temporary licenses to over 40 dispensaries, which allows them to sell non-medical marijuana starting January 1. The Golden State is about to get a lot greener. Sales of recreational marijuana began on Monday, January 1, after Californians voted to legalize the drug in the 2016 election. The market's debut brings an end to prohibition in the most populous state, which is now also the biggest legal marijuana market in America. A dults over the age of 21 can now use, carry, and buy up to an ounce of marijuana for non-medical use, and grow as many as six plants at home, without a doctor's letter. How can you buy it? Though it is legal, Golden State tokers won't find marijuana in corner drug stores. California began issuing temporary licenses to dispensaries — or pot shops — in December that will allow those stores to sell non-medical marijuana. The licenses became valid on January 1. So far, the state Bureau of Cannabis Control has awarded retail licenses to 42 dispensaries from Eureka to Oakland to San Diego. (There are more than 1,300 dispensaries statewide.) Customers can view a full list of the pot shops that received licenses on the bureau's website. State rules dictate that marijuana will not be sold between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. Not everyone in California is on board with the so-called green rush. A review by the Los Angeles Times found that more than 70% of California's counties and cities, including Fresno, Bakersfield, and Anahaim, have moved to ban the sale or cultivation of marijuana. Caliva, a medical marijuana dispensary in San Jose, California, received a temporary license from the state to start selling non-medical marijuana on January 1, 2018. Courtesy of Caliva How much will it cost? The nation's going rate for legal, non-medical marijuana is about $11 per gram or $34 for an eighth of an ounce, according to price index site MJCharts. State law imposes a 15% tax on sales of the drug, which will generate up to $1 billion in new tax revenue annually, according to the state's nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office. Additional state and local taxes means some Californians could expect to pay an effective tax rate of 45% each time they buy. Marijuana could get more expensive after a series of massive wildfires in Northern California last fall wiped out as much as a year's supply for some industry growers. BDS Analytics, a marijuana data insights company, told Business Insider that a shortage could causes prices to rise as much as 10 to 20% — roughly $2 more per gram or $7 more per eighth of an ounce. Where can you smoke it? It's still illegal to consume marijuana in public, on sidewalks, and in places where smoking tobacco is prohibited, like restaurants and theaters. Lighting up while driving is also off-limits. People busted for smoking weed in public can expect to pay a fine between $100 and $250. A private home is the safest bet for legal toking, though landlords may prohibit the possession of marijuana on their premises.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,Rural California grapples with 'green rush' of pot growers,"The four young men had just started their marijuana harvest in rural Northern California when a dozen sheriff's deputies swooped in with guns drawn, arrested them and spent the day chopping down 150 bushy plants with machetes. ""I could do this every day if I …",http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/rural-california-grapples-green-rush-pot-growers-51356741,2017-11-24T08:11:13Z,"The four young men had just started their marijuana harvest in rural Northern California when a dozen sheriff's deputies swooped in with guns drawn, arrested them and spent the day chopping down 150 bushy plants with machetes. ""I could do this every day if I had the personnel,"" Calaveras County Sheriff Rick DiBasilio said during the operation near the Sierra foothills town of Copperopolis, about two hours east of San Francisco. Authorities this year have cut down close to 30,000 plants grown without permits in a county that is reconsidering its embrace of marijuana cultivation on the eve of statewide legalization. ""There are just so many of them,"" the sheriff said of the illegal farms. ""It's never-ending."" Marijuana has deeply divided the financially strapped county, among many where growers are increasingly open about their operations and are starting to encroach on neighborhoods. DiBasilio estimates the county - population 44,000 and about the size of Rhode Island - has more than 1,000 illegal farms in addition to the hundreds with permits or in the process of obtaining them. The influx has caused a backlash among residents and led to the ouster of some county leaders who approved marijuana cultivation. Pot farmers operating legally, meanwhile, say they are helping the local economy, and have threatened to sue over attempts to stop them. California is set to issue licenses in January to grow, transport and sell weed for recreational purposes, nearly 20 years after the state first authorized the drug's consumption with a doctor's recommendation. Farmers can legally grow marijuana for recreational consumption next year but are required to get a local permit before applying for a state license, which has sparked a boom in pot-friendly counties. Calaveras County legalized medical marijuana cultivation last year, seeking to tax the hundreds of farms that popped up in the region after a 2015 wildfire destroyed more than 500 homes. County officials expected to receive about 250 applications by the 2016 deadline. They got 770. About 200 applications have been approved, a similar number rejected, and the others are still being processed. The sheriff gets some of the nearly $10 million in fees and taxes paid by legal farmers to crack down on illegal grows, many of which the department has mapped from the air. The new pot farms have brought a bustling industry that includes the sounds of generators, bright lights illuminating gardens at night, water trucks kicking up dust on their way to grows, the distinct odor of marijuana, and tents, trailers and other temporary housing for migrant workers. Local hardware stores' gardening sections are now stocked with pot farming supplies. Law enforcement officials say they have raided farms where they've found pesticides that are banned in the U.S. ""It has changed our way of life,"" said Bill McManus, head of an organization seeking to ban marijuana in Calaveras County. ""The environmental impacts are atrocious."" To the north, even the fabled pot-growing mecca known as the Emerald Triangle has been thrown into political turmoil as more farmers set up shop ahead of legalization. The California Growers Association estimates about 3,500 farmers in Humboldt, Mendocino and Trinity counties have applied for local permits and will be in positon to receive a state license. Another 29,000 farmers there haven't bothered with the paperwork, according to the group. Mendocino County Sheriff Tom Allman complained his county's laws allowing cultivation are too ""gentle"" and attract violent crime, including a farmworker's recent homicide. In Siskiyou County, leaders declared a state of emergency and called on Gov. Jerry Brown to help with an influx of marijuana farmers, who have snatched up inexpensive land for planting even though pot cultivation is illegal there. Two growers were arrested and charged with offering Siskiyou County Sheriff Jon Lopey $1 million to leave their farms alone. ""That's all you need to know about the type of money involved,"" Lopey said. ""This isn't confined to the state. There's a big market outside of California they are supplying."" In Calaveras County, voters in January replaced four of the five supervisors who voted to legalize marijuana. The new majority has vowed to repeal legalization and institute a strict ban. But a formal vote has been delayed several times amid threats of lawsuits from farmers. ""So much of this is a cultural war,"" said grower Beth Witke. ""I'm tired of being demoralized by the ban supporters."" Witke and other farmers argue they create good-paying jobs for young adults who otherwise would leave the county for the San Francisco Bay Area. She is among a handful of growers who operated quietly in Calaveras County for decades, attracted by the region's climate and proximity to the Bay Area. But the devastating 2015 wildfire helped launch the county's green rush. The fire leveled subdivisions and wooded areas, turning them into attractive farmland. Former homeowners sold their flattened lots to outside growers armed with cash and betting the county would issue permits to grow. Mark Bolger received the first permit. He said a ban would drive out him and his dozen workers. ""I'm trying to do the right thing,"" Bolger said. ""But the first guy through the door always gets shot."" The sheriff said he's focused on farmers who have never applied for a permit or who have continued to grow despite a rejected application. This year, he has raided about 40 farms and seized close to 30,000 plants. In late September, deputies raided two farms that share a waterline west of Copperopolis, and removed more than 300 plants.

46,Forget the film – Fargo is the ultimate holiday destination,"From a gay men's chorus to a winter 'Frostival' with a mobile sauna, North Dakota's most well known city is full of surprises",https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/fargo-travel-things-to-do-north-dakota-united-states-a8499296.html,2018-08-31T13:18:58Z,"Forget Fargo. Don’t get me wrong – I loved the Coen brothers’ dark crime-comedy, not to mention three seasons of a successful spin-off on Netflix. But 22 years later, if you’re still thinking only about the movie or TV series when you hear that word, it’s time to rewire your brain. I’m here to tell you that this North Dakota city is not a godforsaken frozen wasteland of woodchippers. Fargo’s a slice of Oz on the eastern edge of the Great Plains – quirky, colourful and full of surprises: a Scandinavian-Jewish lunch counter; a gay men’s chorus; a thriving immigrant community; a winter “Frostival” with a mobile sauna; an artsy boutique hotel; Microsoft’s third-largest campus; and a championship football team. Is it safe to travel to Indonesia after the earthquakes? More than that, it’s the people of Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota, its sister city across the river, who have drawn me back multiple times. They all seem to share a remarkable can-do attitude and collaborative energy. Locals are quick to credit their forebears – the Scandinavian settlers who depended on each other to raise barns, harvest crops and recover from floods. That same work ethic, dynamism and community support helps a new generation of makers, entrepreneurs and artists who dream big and often succeed. The long, frigid winters seem to only bolster Fargoans’ industriousness and sense of humour. When I showed up in June, I ran into a friend before we’d even had a chance to make plans – downtown’s that small. That afternoon, I heard that drivers get a friendly written warning before their first parking ticket – locals are that nice. When you go, chat them up. See the woodchipper at the visitors’ centre if you must. Then, get to know the real Fargo. The real woodchipper (with fake leg) used in the film (The Washington Post/ Jenn Ackerman) Places to go Local faves On autumn Saturdays, take your competitive spirit to the Fargodome, which houses the home field of American football team North Dakota State Bison. The Thundering Herd, as the squad is known, has won the NCAA Division I Football Championship tournament six of the past seven seasons. Fargoans bleed yellow and green all year round. (Insider tip: you’ll hear chatter about Carson – that’s Herd alumnus and hometown hero Carson Wentz, now in the NFL as a quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles.) Tailgating is a sight to behold: it begins at 4am, and you’ll find custom-wrapped buses and motor homes, propane-heated tents and vans donning bison horns. The dome seats 19,000 for games and 25,000 for concerts such as the recent Def Leppard and Journey shows. Across from the dome: the Fargo Air Museum. I love stepping into places where you momentarily forget what state – or country – you’re in. For something utterly surreal, try Sons of Norway Kringen Lodge No 25. The lodge is among the largest in this Nordic heritage fraternal organisation, and the building, an old Buick dealership with red carpet and walls, is decorated with Norwegian folk art, Viking carvings and rosemaling – a traditional painting style made up of scrolls and flowers. Even the skip outside is rosemaled. As I ate cherry pie in the dining room, a regular group played bridge and two volunteers chatted about lutefisk – a kind of Nordic dried fish. On my way out with a pack of homemade lefse (a potato flatbread) I picked up a newsletter and glanced at “klub” activities open to the public: Norwegian lunches, walleye dinners, folk dancing, rosemaling practice and weekly live music in the Troll Lounge, which has a 96-foot mural and 22 handcarved trolls. Guidebook musts Outside Fargo, it’s nearly impossible to mention the city without people commenting on the film, so hats off to the Fargo-Moorhead Convention and Visitors Bureau (CVB) for treating visitors to a little Fargo. The CVB displays the screenplay and a promotional ice scraper, but the main attraction is the original woodchipper, with a leg poking out. A friendly woman rushed over from behind her desk, holding a flannel hat with ear flaps. “Would you like me to take your picture in the hat? You can pretend to push the foot in.” I handed her my camera and posed awkwardly. “Now,” she said, “with a horrified look!” While I was there, a mother and daughter from northern Virginia arrived and announced that North Dakota was their 50th state. The woman excitedly gave them “Best for Last Club” T-shirts and certificates, and the Virginians told us about their travels. I left the centre and spent 36 hours in Fargo without hearing another peep about Fargo. Known for its American modernism and regional art, the Plains Art Museum was an early investor in the town centre’s renaissance and has become a gathering place for the community. Located in a gorgeous turn-of-the-century warehouse that once stored farm machinery, the museum has about 4,000 works in its permanent collection. There’s a print studio, performance area, pollinator garden and space for workshops; there’s one on Native American poetry and art, for example. When I visited, I enjoyed a large audio installation, a William Wegman pup, a Warhol screenprint of first lady Jacqueline Kennedy and David Bradley’s Mona Lisa-esque 1990 painting Pow-Wow Princess in the Process of Acculturation. The museum is free, thanks to members and donors. Some of its other funding comes from what’s called charitable gaming, a widely accepted practice in North Dakota that generates millions of dollars in taxes (from blackjack and bingo et al) for a state that offers meagre funding to nonprofit organisations. For a uniquely Midwestern experience, head to Scheels (The Washington Post/ Jenn Ackerman) Places to eat Local faves In their dining-out days, my grandmothers would have loved BernBaum’s. One collected mid-century modern furniture; the other whipped up Jewish meals and desserts like nobody’s business. So I had to smile when I walked into Brett Bernath’s Madhaus, which has largely been taken over by the fabulous lunch counter run by his wife, Andrea Baumgardner. She started making bagels in a corner of the furniture shop in 2016, and soon, BernBaum’s eclipsed the Madhaus; much of Bernath’s furniture (such as the pink fibreglass, boomerang-shaped bowling alley bench from the 1950s) has become restaurant seating. The Scandinavian-German and Jewish fare, reflecting the proprietors’ heritages, includes potato latkes, knishes with mustard crème fraîche, cheese blintzes with lingonberry sauce, chicken matzo ball soup and brisket with ramp soft cheese and pickled rhubarb. You’ll probably see Baumgardner cooking on her 1948 four-burner stove below the “Shalom” sign. Don’t miss her occasional themed dinners, which sell out quickly. The owners of Wild Terra Cider and Brewing acknowledge the complete lack of commercial apple orchards in North Dakota. But that didn’t stop them from opening Fargo’s first cidery in December, and I’m thankful for that. Most of Wild Terra’s dozen offerings, which change daily, are from the Pacific Northwest or Michigan. But it does craft some of its own ciders – including the blueberry and banana Stargazer, with apples from small local growers. The cidery is in a beautifully restored, century-old horse stable. The menu, all vegetarian, includes treats such as a Buddha bowl with microgreens and brussels sprouts with “bacon” from the Herbivorous Butcher in Minneapolis. Locals gather for Eighties movies upstairs on oldschool sofas; a mustard coloured velvet one has national parks patches. The new co-op is next door. Tim Griffin pulls a cup for a customer at Young Blood Coffee, home of reportedly rapturous cinnamon toast (The Washington Post/ Jenn Ackerman) Guidebook musts At Rustica Eatery &amp; Tavern, just across the Main Avenue bridge in Moorhead, dinner is comfortable and neighbourhoody. The more casual, seat-yourself tavern has a wood burning pizza oven and copper beer taps, and the eatery, where I found a spot at the bar, has exposed brick walls, indistinct jazz playing in the background and a relaxed, classy vibe. Not surprisingly for this part of the country, the menu is meat heavy, with rack of lamb and cornmeal-dusted local walleye fish, but it also features house pasta and a board so full of roasted veggies, dips and towering baguette slices that I needed a doggy bag. That plus a salad was just $9 (£7), thanks to a well attended and hard to believe happy hour from 5pm to 6pm and 9pm to 11pm: you’ll get half price on all starters, soups, salads, pizzas, burgers, mac and cheese, and select beers and wines. No fine print. The first thing I noticed about the cinnamon toast at Young Blood Coffee: it was doorstep thick. Then I saw the tiny lakes of butter pooling in the fresh sourdough, and I knew that if my childhood toast had looked like this, I would’ve never left home. Young Blood makes its own sourdough (a bargain at $5 per loaf, the same price as avocado toast) and roasts its own coffee beans. As I savoured my slice of heaven, Rush played on vinyl atop the morning chatter. Nearby, I noticed a lovely green matcha latte with an Instagram-perfect design in the foamed milk. This new location is around the corner from hip Roberts Alley, which has an indoor bike park like nothing I’ve ever seen: bike tools, a pump and gym-style lockers and benches.

Featuring more than 300 local and regional makers, mostly women, the shop is often bustling. Under twinkly lights and hundreds of origami cranes swooping down from the ceiling, you’ll find a jigsaw puzzle of the famed Fargo Theatre; a onesie adorned with a loon, the Minnesota state bird; jewellery made from repurposed crockery; zipper pouches featuring hockey skates; and hair pomade from Dakotah Beard Oils. Yeobo Sweet Shop is in the back. How can you not love the bulk offerings when they’re green apple Army guys, blackcurrant gummy moustaches and giant sour spiders? If you’d rather DIY than buy, check out Unglued’s classes in leatherworking, ceramics, embroidery and macramé. Unglued stocks craftwork from over 300 local and regional makers (The Washington Post/ Jenn Ackerman) For a uniquely Midwestern experience, head to Scheels, a nearly 200,000-square foot mash-up of REI, Dick’s Sporting Goods and Cabela’s, with a 12-car Ferris wheel and enough taxidermied animals for a natural history museum. Upon arriving, the world’s friendliest cashier greeted me, and cheery welcomes continued as I ambled through the shop (I stopped counting at eight). I passed all the expected sportswear and gear, as well as skateboards, pogo sticks, cornhole sets and Bison ties with green and yellow checks. An entire section features merch for lake life (locals’ ubiquitous weekend activity), with packs of water balloons, kites and a gun that kills insects with a spray of table salt – all things you could buy cheaper online, but then you’d miss the archery shooting range, golf simulator and collection of lifesize presidents around the store. And then there’s the gun department upstairs (supposedly the largest in the state), where I snapped a picture of the “Youth Shotguns” section in case I later thought I’d imagined it. Guidebook musts When I visited in June, Dakota Fine Art was still glowing from its lively grand opening. The nine prominent local and regional artists who own and run the gallery had reason to celebrate: the space is filled with stunning pieces that reflect Great Plains landscape and culture. Steve Revland, a furniture maker and one of the founding artists, had brought in his $3,750 chamcha root coffee table that morning. “It weighs 500 pounds,” he told me, “and I got it here myself.” Among the lighter-weight pieces is a playful series by photographer Meg Spielman Peldo featuring Corso, the rehabilitated bison who has become the NDSU mascot. Water Buffalo shows him at a swimming pool and Bison Elevator captures Corso in front of a grain silo. By the way, Nichole’s Fine Pastry next door has dreamy traditional desserts and Scandinavian treats such as krumkake and kransakake. Fargoans are serious about their North Dakota State Bison (The Washington Post/ Jenn Ackerman) Just as I’ve begun to tire of homogenous retail boutiques that have a little bit of everything (Anthroplogie mini-me’s, with well made dresses, handcrafted home goods, tasselled pillows, sustainable soap), I came across Others. The shop may look like similar boutiques, with its beautiful products and minimalist decor, but founder Laura Morris has raised the bar by donating all store profits to education, social health and job creation. Morris, a pharmacist and Fargo native, opened the shop four years ago and has never taken an Others paycheck. With each purchase, shoppers support vulnerable populations around the globe: wooden spoons and bowls help fund employment programmes for sex trafficking survivors; hoop earrings made from recycled brass help jewellery makers grow their businesses. Each set of sunglasses sold yields a free eye exam and glasses for someone in need; every Bogobrush sale means a toothbrush giveaway. This month, Others expects to reach the $500,000 mark for donations. Now that’s something to shop about. Places to stay Local fave When I first stayed at the Hotel Donaldson in 2015, I was blown away by the 17 artist-inspired rooms, daily wine and cheese happy hour, rooftop bar, turndown truffle and complimentary morning pastries delivered to my room. This is Fargo? Earlier this summer, when my beagle and I planned a rendezvous in town with my friend Margie, I knew exactly where we’d stay. The boutique hotel is conveniently located within walking distance of the river, shops and restaurants, although you’d eat very well even if you never left the property. Too tired to venture out, Margie and I kicked back in our room and enjoyed a HoDo flatbread with garden-fresh tomatoes and basil, along with fare we’d picked up from Vinyl Taco across the street. One taco was particularly spicy, and Margie, who grew up nearby, said “Uffda!” – a Norwegian exclamation of surprise that I’d seen on T-shirts and mugs. Rooms start at $184 per night. The Hotel Donaldson has 17 artist-inspired rooms (The Washington Post/ Jenn Ackerman) Guidebook must Stepping into the Element by Westin in west Fargo feels a bit like checking into an ecofriendly spa, with its modern and minimalist decor, sunlit rooms and greenery at every turn. The pet-friendly hotel has priority parking for fuel-efficient vehicles, a Tesla charging station, free self-service laundry, a nicely sized gym and pool, and complimentary shuttles to the airport and downtown. Most of the 130 rooms have a full kitchen. Borrow one of Element’s free bikes to pedal to dinner at the Blarney Stone Pub, or walk next door to Tru Blu Social Club. Studios start at $129 per night, including breakfast. Places to explore Local fave Read more Here’s a fun fact: the Red River flows north! This slow-moving waterway meanders 550 miles from Breckenridge, Minnesota, up to Lake Winnipeg in Manitoba, and most of those miles form the border between North Dakota and Minnesota. From downtown, walk across Veterans Memorial Bridge, where you’ll find signage with more trivia: “The Red River Valley is one of the flattest landscapes on Earth.” Stroll north along the tree-lined river to nearby Hjemkomst Centre, home to a replica Viking ship. You can rent kayaks there or farther south at Lindenwood Park on the Fargo side – which also rents bikes and has a cool pedestrian bridge to Gooseberry Mound Park in Moorhead. (Check it out: the bridge lifts when the river levels rise.) To retire by the Red at day’s end, head to Lindenwood Campground, where tent sites cost $30 a day. Guidebook must Just across the Red River, Moorhead is often overlooked by visitors. Granted, the high school’s mascot is the spud, and the only unanimous recommendation I received from locals was to visit their Dairy Queen fast-food restaurant, where the Dilly Bar ice cream was supposedly invented. But even though Moorhead is couple of decades behind Fargo in downtown development, there are an increasing number of reasons to visit this side of the Red. Don’t miss Bluestem Centre for the Arts, a fantastic amphitheatre venue. Get your zen on during free yoga on the Comstock House lawn, and get your drinks at Junkyard Brewing, which feels like a college party with nightly live music, free popcorn, a taco truck and unexpected, always changing libations such as stout with peanuts and an experimental strawberry sour. © The Washington Post",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The question facing jurors i…,http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/industrial-scale-pork-trial-federal-nuisance-lawsuits-54144451,2018-03-31T13:28:21Z,"Drive past clustered hog sheds containing thousands of animals in the country's No. 2 pork-producing state on the wrong day and the reason hundreds of North Carolina neighbors are suing in federal court is clear: it really stinks. The question facing jurors in a federal lawsuit starting Monday is whether the open-air animal waste pits that proliferated over a generation generate intense smells, clouds of flies and noise. The trial's outcome could shake the profits and change production methods of pork producers who have enjoyed legislative protection and promotion in one of the nation's food hubs. Supporters see industrial-scale hog complexes as generating jobs and revenues in rural communities. Friendly lawmakers last year sought to retroactively sink the lawsuits by more than 500 neighbors now lined up to go to trial one after another. Neighbors like Randy Davis contend the industry's long practice of storing liquid waste in what producers call lagoons, then spraying treated excrement onto nearby fields as fertilizer, spells misery for them. ""A lagoon is something that a pretty 15-year-old in the South Pacific swims in,"" said Davis, a state employee whose Green County home is about is about ? mile (1.15 kilometers) from the nearest impoundment. ""This is not a lagoon. It's a cesspool. It's a 9-acre feces and urine pit."" The plaintiffs' attorneys also say that information uncovered about company influence campaigns show their ""knowledge of the harmful health effects of its hog operations,"" the inadequacy of regulations to address those health effects, and the availability of feasible alternatives. Pork producers say they not only care about their rural neighbors, but their operations are inspected annually to make sure they comply with environmental regulations. There are 14 state inspectors checking 2,100 hog operations. Hog growers are keeping an eye on the litigation that could force them to make changes or part with big payouts. ""Certainly we're watching it. There's some levels of concern in particular as it relates to possible impact to the economy"" of the rural communities where the farms operate and pay wages, said Andy Curliss, CEO of the North Carolina Pork Council, a trade group. The upcoming string of federal lawsuits target Murphy-Brown LLC, the hog production division of Virginia's Smithfield Foods. Smithfield was bought in 2013 by a division of China-based WH Group, the world's largest pork producer. China, with higher feed and labor costs than American pork producers, is one of the fastest-growing markets for U.S. exports and including Hong Kong now makes up about 9 percent, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. The cases are being overseen by Judge W. Earl Britt, who was born 86 years ago in a town of about 130 people along the South Carolina border and joined the court in 1980 after Democratic President Jimmy Carter's nomination. The first case to be tried next week involves 10 neighbors of Kinlaw Farm, a Bladen County hog operation located 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of a massive Smithfield Foods slaughterhouse. The farm and its owners, who raise hogs under contract with Murphy-Brown, are not defendants. Instead, the target is the company that set specific standards of how the farm must operate. The neighbors' lawyers hand-picked the plaintiffs for this first trial. A second trial starting later this spring will involve parties selected by hog industry lawyers. The two sides will alternate choosing the players for further trials. Such test cases allow lawyers to measure the strength of their evidence. The resulting verdicts - and any financial penalties - create guiderails for a possible settlement, said Christopher Seeger, a New York attorney who helped negotiate a $4.85 billion settlement over the health risks of arthritis painkiller Vioxx. Perhaps more important in shaping the ultimate resolution are the precedent-setting decisions judges make to accept some evidence and keep other details from jurors, Seeger said. Hog industry attorneys say the trial should be strictly limited to whether the 10 suing neighbors are suffering with a foul nuisance. They don't want jurors to hear about alternative disposal hog waste methods used elsewhere, industry lobbying, or evidence of Chinese ownership. ""You generate data from these bellwether trials that are very informative,"" Seeger said. ""Where people would get more, where people would get less"" based on how evidence persuades jurors. ———— Follow Emery P. Dalesio at http://twitter.com/emerydalesio.

Any marijuana sold when recreational sales become legal Jan. 1 in the nation's most populous state will have been grown without regulatory controls that will eventually be in place. Pot could contain pesticides, molds and other contaminants. ""Buyer beware,"" cautioned Donald Land, a University of California, Davis, chemistry professor who is the chief scientific consultant at Steep Hill Labs Inc., which tests marijuana in several states. Earlier this year, Land oversaw testing that found 93 percent of samples collected by KNBC-TV from 15 dispensaries in four Southern California counties tested positive for pesticides. That may come as a surprise for consumers who tend to trust what's on store shelves because of federal regulations by the U.S. Agriculture Department or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. ""Unfortunately, that's not true of cannabis,"" Land said. ""They wrongly assume it's been tested for safety."" Stiffer regulations and testing requirements are being phased in next year, but growers and sellers have a six-month grace period to sell existing inventory grown under the loosely regulated medical marijuana program in place two decades. With only a year to a develop a complex bureaucratic infrastructure of regulations, taxes and licensing for recreational marijuana, state officials recognized it wasn't realistic or fair to require inventory grown or manufactured under existing rules to suddenly meet testing standards. Shops will have six months to sell the current crop of cannabis before their inventory has to pass tests. Any pot harvested or manufactured after Jan. 1, however, will be subject to testing for potency and contaminants with a high public health risk. Stricter limits will be phased in by the start of 2019. Meanwhile, any pot that hasn't been tested will need to be labeled, said Alex Traverso, Bureau of Cannabis Control spokesman. ""That's one of the biggest reasons for regulation: to establish rules that protect public safety and improve the quality of the product,"" Traverso said. ""When people see a sticker that says 'Not tested,' at least they know and they can choose whether they want to purchase that or not."" That means there will probably be a lot of labels required when everything from joints to cookies and oils go on sale. Land estimated that less than 5 percent of medical marijuana — the only pot legal to sell before 2018 — is now tested. As the industry emerges from the shadows, growers, manufacturers, shops and related businesses have to navigate a maze of regulations that are still taking shape across state and local jurisdictions as sales are about to begin. Juan Hidalgo, agricultural commissioner for Santa Cruz County, said pesticides are a top concern, and he wants to know what is being applied and whether workers on site are protected. Farmers who spray their own pesticides have to get a certificate from the commissioner that requires passing a test and taking refresher courses every three years. ""A lot of these folks, up until now, they haven't been aware of what those requirements are and the proper use of pesticides,"" Hidalgo said. ""That's something we're hoping we can change in the coming weeks."" The incentive will be that entire crops or batches will have to be destroyed if unacceptable levels of contaminants are discovered. Several years ago, Steep Hill tested concentrates at a cannabis contest and found traces of solvents from extracting hash oil used in edibles and other products in all but three of 135 samples, Land said. ""At first they were mad because they couldn't sell their stuff the way they wanted to,"" Land said. But eventually, manufacturers figured out how to more safely produce their products, and two years later all 140 samples the lab tested passed. He thinks a similar thing will happen with pesticides as testing becomes mandatory and the industry adapts. Initially, though, it could mean lower yields. Mike Winderman, manager of The Green Easy in Los Angeles, supports the idea of eliminating pesticides, but also thinks the issue has been overhyped when the vast majority of crops that people eat are grown with pesticides and even organic crops could be subject to pesticides drifting from nearby farms. ""I think it's a little funny that this year everybody's caring about pesticides,"" he said. ""People have been smoking weed 30, 40, 50 years, and it's never been an issue."" Like many shops, Winderman's products are tested for potency, but not pesticides. Prices are dropping for the current crop because they have a limited shelf life due to the regulatory controls that will eventually go into place. Winderman said he wouldn't be surprised to find shops snapping up inventory now to avoid taxes that will take effect Jan. 1 and because some popular products may not be available if small producers who don't want to pay registration fees drop out of the industry.

49,Portugal lures dry farmers with water,Portugal lures dry farmers with water,https://abcnews.go.com/International/portugal-lures-dry-farmers-water/story?id=57512421,2018-09-02T13:08:55Z,"As wildfires scorched California yet again this summer, Jose Dariush Leal da Costa, a Bay Area native with Portuguese roots, was harvesting his first almonds in a sun-drenched, watery oasis in southern Portugal. The largest artificial lake in the European Union, the 250 sq km (97 sq miles) Alqueva, irrigates an area the size of Los Angeles, luring foreign investors at a time when climate change is fanning droughts from California to northern Europe. A man waits for the sunset at a viewpoint near Alqueva reservoir, in Monsaraz, Portugal, Aug. 8, 2018. European fruit growers, Spanish olive oil makers, almond and berry farmers from California and Chile, and many others are moving in to rival local farmers on these irrigated lands, whose prices soared by 50 percent in the past five years. The 5 billion euro ($5.8 billion) irrigation project on the River Guadiana, begun two decades ago to revive a region at risk of desertification, is only now reaching its initial design capacity and there are plans to expand it further. It has also boosted income and jobs in the most disadvantaged region of Western Europe's poorest country. A worker checks the irrigation hoses on an olive plantation near Portel, Portugal, Aug. 2, 2018. ""We have enough water to the point when I'm five years into a drought and not worried about water,"" said Leal da Costa, noting that water scarcity was always a worry in California, the world's largest almond producer, where farms compete for water resources with cities and industries. During a trip to the United States in June, Prime Minister Antonio Costa invited investors in California, which has a climate similar to Portugal, to set up shop around Alqueva in a pitch that played on concerns about global warming. ""It was very effective. In California, land is very expensive and water is very scarce. If you have affordable land and tenable, affordable water, these are the incentives people need,"" said Rusty Areias, a former California Assemblyman turned investor who met Costa during his visit. Hoses for irrigation systems are stacked before being installed in an intensive olive plantation near Portel, Portugal, Aug. 2, 2018. Areias has visited Alqueva and is talking to the government about water rights for potential U.S. investment, including his own, while encouraging farmers in parched Fresno county to diversify their business to Portugal, which is ""uncongested and a lot like California was in the 1950s"". Seeking to boost economic growth after being hit by crisis in 2011, Portugal provides cheap loans and other incentives to investors ready to spend more than 500,000 euros and create jobs. The Alqueva project only this year reached the design goal of selling its water to 80 percent of the area it serves. State firm EDIA, which runs it, plans to expand irrigation coverage by over 40 percent to 170,000 hectares by 2022. A view of the Alqueva reservoir near Monsaraz, Portugal, Aug. 8, 2018. Other Portuguese regions want similar irrigation projects, but Alqueva is unlikely to face competition from new schemes as EU rules that require sufficient clean water supplies for human needs have largely halted damming for agriculture. Alqueva has faced environmental complaints, with green groups warning that the flooded areas would destroy wildlife habitats, while the intensive agriculture it encourages would pollute groundwater and soil. Areas irrigated by Alqueva now stretch almost from the Atlantic coast to the Spanish border, creating what EDIA chief Jose Salema calls ""a green barrier to desertification"", a phenomenon that threatens swathes of southern and central Europe. An aerial view of a cereal intensive farm near Monsaraz, Portugal, Aug. 8, 2018. Salema says water consumption per hectare at Alqueva is half of what it had been designed for, thanks to more efficient growing and watering methods such as drip irrigation. Still, California investor Areias said water rights in Portugal still need to be made clearer to convince more cautious investors, who need guarantees of water supply for over 20 years. EDIA estimates foreign investors already work on an estimated 25,000 hectares, a quarter of all Alqueva-irrigated lands in use, having put 250 million euros into crops and equipment. Beekeeper Helder Martins looks at a hive on a farm where his bees pollinate the trees near Pias, Portugal, Aug. 10, 2018. Olives remain the area's main crop, with yields that are four times the operating cost. Alqueva boosted olive oil output in Portugal, the world's fourth largest exporter, to a record 147 million litres last year, official figures show. Two fields are seen at a farm near Portel, Portugal, Aug. 2, 2018. ""There are more jobs, new crops, which is always great for the region,"" said small-scale local farmer Helder Martins, whose beekeeping business has improved since almond growers started hiring his hives to pollinate their trees. Unemployment in the wider Alentejo region around Alqueva fell more sharply than anywhere else in Portugal last year to below the average national level, dropping to 8.4 percent. Almond plantations in the area doubled in size last year to more than 5,500 hectares, with foreign investors dominating new plantings. Rows of sunflowers are seen on a cereal intensive farm near Portel, Portugal, Aug. 2, 2018. Fruit plantations have also expanded strongly to more than 1,000 hectares, helped by investment from Spain, Germany, and Switzerland. ""We have plantations in various European countries and we see that many types of fruit grow a lot faster here,"" said Joao Serrano, CEO of the Portuguese unit of Swiss-based Fairfruit Group. Intensive farmer Jose Dariush Leal da Costa poses for a portrait at his almond tree plantation near Portel, Portugal, Aug. 2, 2018. But nowhere may escape the impact of global warming for long. Portugal had its own deadly fires last year after a three-year drought, with a big blaze south of Alqueva this year. In a scenario of more frequent and longer droughts, an expanded Alqueva may no longer be sustainable by 2030-2040, requiring tough conservation efforts, said Prof. Ricardo Serralheiro of the University of Evora.

50,Heatwave threatens to cause shortage of peas,UK pea suppliers follow lettuce growers in warning over harvest after high temperatures hold back crop growth.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44822006,2018-07-13T15:23:55Z,"Image copyright Yorkshire peas Image caption There aren't as many of these little green things as there normally are at this time of year UK pea growers are warning of shortages in supplies following the recent hot weather. Growers say the heat and lack of rain means peas are struggling to form in their pods and that crops will be 20-30% below normal levels. The pea crop is the latest casualty of the summer's unusual weather. Last month, lettuce growers warned of shortages. The UK is importing 30% of its lettuces, whereas normally it is self sufficient at this time of year. The UK is the biggest consumer of peas per head in Europe, and it is also the biggest producer of peas for freezing. Ian Keyes, director of Yorkshire-based Swaythorpe Growers - one of the biggest growers in the UK, said levels were ""dropping dramatically"". ""Each pea plant is currently yielding between three and four pods - rather than the six to seven usually seen. It's a combination of drought and heat, and peas are not standing up to that very well."" Despite being the biggest producer, the UK's demand for peas means it also imports them. Mr Keyes warned that the shortage in the UK coupled with problems in other countries would see prices could rise: ""We're very worried as an industry. For the first time we won't be able to make up the shortfall from elsewhere. ""Spain and Portugal had a poor harvest, while Hungary's was poor and Poland's a complete write-off. Those normal sources of extra supply are simply not there. There will inevitably be some price increase."" Image copyright British Leafy Salad Growers Association Life for the lettuce, however, has improved, says Dieter Lloyd, from the British Leafy Salad Growers Association (BLSGA): ""The temperature has dropped, which is a lovely thing for a lettuce."" Mr Lloyd said that lettuce supply had been squeezed by rising demand, which perks up as the heat rises, and production difficulties because of that same heat. He said: ""When the temperature is around 22 degrees, demand rises by about 10-20%, but when it reaches 28 degrees, as it was at the beginning of the month, demand rises by about 40%."" However, he said that the UK was still having to import lettuces from Spain, Germany and Poland, whereas normally at this time of year the UK was normally pretty much self-sufficient. Mr Lloyd said prices may rise: ""There is an impact on price - it hasn't fed through to retail prices as yet - but we are anticipating this. Wholesale prices are already up by about 20-30%."" He also warned that shortages could affect other crops, such as celery, onions, carrots, broccoli and cauliflower, which are also being affected by high temperatures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,Trump Ethanol Moves Could Be Worse for Farmers Than Soy Tariffs,"Based on his own back-of-the-envelope calculations, Minnesota farmer Kirby Hettver could lose tens of thousands of dollars of earnings because of President Donald Trump.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-10/trump-ethanol-moves-could-be-worse-for-farmers-than-soy-tariffs,2018-04-10T09:00:00Z,"Based on his own back-of-the-envelope calculations, Minnesota farmer Kirby Hettver could lose tens of thousands of dollars of earnings because of President Donald Trump. But damaging as the brewing trade war with China may turn out to be for Hettver and other American soybean farmers, he says the greater financial impact could come if Trump moves ahead with changes to the U.S. ethanol mandate, known as the Renewable Fuel Standard, or RFS. While proposed tariffs announced by China last week would apply to about $14 billion a year of U.S. soybean exports, the RFS accounts for 38 percent of the U.S. corn crop, valued at about $21 billion at current prices. And unlike the situation in the soybean market, where other buyers could pick up the slack for a drop in Chinese demand, the undoing of U.S. biofuel laws could lead to real demand destruction. Farmers “thought they were voting for an administration that was supportive of rural America,” and now they’re anxious, said Wallace Tyner, an economist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. The RFS requires oil refiners to blend ethanol, mostly made from corn, and biodiesel, derived from soybeans, with petroleum. In the 13 years since its inception, the mandate has been a key driver for grain demand. But the oil industry has taken issue with the law, saying that it’s too costly to comply with. Trump vowed his support for the RFS during campaign rallies in Midwestern states like Iowa, the leading U.S. corn grower and ethanol producer. He has repeated the pledge since taking office, and last fall ordered Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt to back down on possible changes to the law. Then in January, the largest U.S. East Coast oil refiner filed for bankruptcy and blamed the cost of complying with the mandate. That thrust the issue back onto the political agenda and spurred Trump to hold meetings -- the most recent one on Monday-- in an attempt to carve out a deal between the oil and agriculture lobbies. Tweet Storm The National Corn Growers Association, along with other groups, had its members send a barrage of tweets to Trump ahead of Monday’s meeting, reminding him of his promise to uphold the law. The threat to ethanol demand comes as the rural economy is already suffering from years of crop gluts. The oversupply sparked a prolonged rout for grain prices, and U.S. farmer incomes are projected to fall to a 12-year low in 2018. At the same time, China has retaliated to Trump’s hard-line stance on trade with a plan for duties on about $50 billion of U.S. imports, including a host of agriculture products. On Monday, Trump acknowledged the impending pain that farmers may feel from the trade war. “Our farmers are great patriots,” Trump said to Washington reporters. “They understand that they’re doing this for the country. We’ll make it up to them.” Trump Vows Farmers to Be ‘Better Off’ Because of Trade Fight Farmers like Hettver see the trade impact from China’s duties as more of a done deal, but are holding out hope that Trump will stand by his ethanol pledges and spare them extra hardship. “I hope he holds that promise because after what’s happened with the tariffs, we really need the RFS,” Hettver, who’s also president of the Minnesota Corn Growers Association, said in a telephone interview. “We’ve been tightening our belts for five years.” Some oil refiners are using the meetings with Trump to push for a ceiling on the price of Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs. Refiners without the capability to blend ethanol or biodiesel to meet the annual consumption targets under the law have to buy the credits. RINs Impact Hettver cited studies, including one from Iowa State University in Ames, that a cap on RINs would lower the price of corn. Based on his average annual yield, he says that means he has “$50,000 at risk.” Meanwhile, the Chinese duties could mean a hit of $23,000 to his soy profits. In an April 6 letter to Iowa’s Republican Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst, ethanol proponents in the state, including Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. and Green Plains Inc., urged the legislators to tell Trump that a cap would be “viewed as nothing less than a declaration of war on rural America and a complete abdication of his repeated promises to protect the RFS.” The coalition also called for Trump to approve the year-round sale of higher blends of ethanol, “in light of the harmful Chinese tariffs on the Midwest farm sector.” In an April 6 statement, Grassley also referenced the trade spats and said that any waiver or caps on the credits would undermine the mandate and “deal a massive blow to rural America.” — With assistance by Jennifer Jacobs, and Jennifer A Dlouhy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is part of a pan-European project in which gardeners and growers are gathering data about their soil. The findings will be used to help meet the global demand for food. The GROW Observatory is being led by a team at the university's Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art &amp; Design. They are offering free soil sensors which will build a comprehensive picture of the Scotland and Europe's growing practices. The small sensors create ""smart gardens"" and send the information to a smartphone app. The data will be used to help forecast and prepare for extreme weather events like floods and heatwaves, as part of a drive to promote sustainable food growing and soil conservation. The moisture levels are also being watched from space, with the European Space Agency's sentinel-1 satellite reporting back its assessment of how wet or dry soils are in different areas. The sensors on the ground will help find out just how accurate the satellite data is. Image caption The sensors are unobtrusive and look like small beige twigs In the jargon this is ""establishing ground truth"". In this case, literally. Anyone with a garden, allotment or orchard is able to apply for one of the sensors by visiting the growobservatory.org website. The sensors are unobtrusive. They look a little like a small beige twig. Pressed into the ground alongside plants, they collect data on soil moisture, light and air temperature. The information is passed to the gardener's smartphone via a bluetooth link, simply by standing close by. The phone passes it on to a central database. In country where we seem to be surrounded by soil - damp soil, most of the year - it may not seem apparent that we are facing a global soil crisis. Last year a study backed by the United Nations found the a third of the planet's was severely degraded and that we were losing 24 billion tonnes of fertile soil a year. The Global Land Outlook said the culprits included intensive agriculture, erosion and climate change. The €5m EU Horizon 2020 project is being led from Dundee and involves 18 partner organisations across Europe. Image copyright European Space Agency Image caption The moisture levels are also being watched from space The GROW project director Dr Deborah Long said the project ranged from olive groves in Greece to apple orchards in Ireland. ""We're looking for people from right across Europe to work with us to gather data, to share data and then to use that data so that we can all understand more about soil - the importance of soil and its careful management,"" she added. She said the data would also help us know more about growing: """"How do we grow more food, how do we grow healthier food, how do we grow and access food locally?"" GROW has already created a large community across Europe, with participants their experiences through its website, social media and online courses. Unlike many other scientific projects, its name has not been manipulated to create a snappy acronym. In this case GROW simply means ""grow"". The sensors won't harm your chrysanths or spuds.

53,Mexican poppy producing state pushes to decriminalize opium,Legislators in the violence-torn Mexican state of Guerrero vote to legalize production of opium for pharmaceutical use in a move they hope will reduce crime and help local farmers,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/mexican-poppy-producing-state-votes-decriminalize-opium-57271654,2018-08-19T21:00:17Z,"Political leaders from Mexico 's main heroin-producing state are pushing the federal government to legalize opium production for pharmaceutical use in a move they hope will reduce violence and help local farmers. Legislators in Guerrero state voted Friday to send an initiative to the Mexican Senate for further debate, since the proposal to legitimize opium output would require changes to federal health and penal codes. Incoming Interior Minister Olga Sanchez has expressed support for nationwide legalization of opium production for medical purposes after President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador takes office in December. The mountainous state of Guerrero, on Mexico's southern Pacific Coast, is home to most of the poppy bulbs that yield heroin consumed in the U.S. Guerrero state legislator Ricardo Mejia said an estimated 120,000 people cultivate poppy in poor, isolated communities across the state. A legal channel to sell sticky poppy sap could offer growers more stable incomes, he argues. The United Nations estimates that Mexico has the world's third-largest geographic area dedicated to illicit opium cultivation, after top producer Afghanistan and Myanmar. Yet prescription opioids are severely restricted for cancer patients and the terminally ill in Mexico. ""We propose a paradigm change,"" Mejia said. Criminal groups control access to the poppy fields tucked high in the rugged Sierra Madre mountains of Guerrero, more than five hours by car along bumpy dirt roads from the state capital of Chilpancingo or the nearby beach resort of Acapulco. Subsistence farmers have been pressured under threat of violence in recent decades to grow poppy rather than crops like coffee or mangoes. Mejia considers the forced production of poppy a form of slavery. ""They can recover their freedom via the legal cultivation of poppy,"" he said. ""Right now the criminal groups have a social base because they control the only economic activity of the people."" Guerrero Gov. Hector Astudillo first floated the idea of decriminalizing poppy in 2016 to combat the state's rampant drug gang violence. Guerrero has one of the highest murder rates in Mexico, with 71 homicides per 100,000 residents last year. The lush green hills of Guerrero are ideal for poppies. Mountains shield the delicate plant from strong winds, while high elevations and an arid climate prevent moisture from sucking away its precious sap. At harvest, growers slice the bulbs, releasing sap with a high morphine content. The sap forms a paste that is then scraped off and sent for processing in clandestine labs. But this lucrative industry is under threat. Guerrero state security spokesman Roberto Alvarez says increased use in the U.S. of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has caused prices for Mexican opium paste on the black market to plummet to as little as $263 per kilo from more than $1,000 per kilo a year ago. Criminal groups have compensated for the lost revenue by ramping up extortions, vehicle thefts and kidnappings in Guerrero, while subsistence farmers struggle to make ends meet. ""The growers are in a crisis situation,"" Alvarez said. ""Opium used to be a very good income — enough to buy a TV or a little car and to get by. Now it's not viable.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kevork Djansezian/Getty HP will start making registers for stores where marijuana is sold. It's the first major tech company to produce hardware for the marijuana industry. The computer industry pioneer is partnering with marijuana startup Flowhub to sell point-of-sale solutions that come installed with marijuana-specific software. The goal with this technology is to make it easy for marijuana stores, called dispensaries, to be compliant with state law and federal guidelines. Hewlett-Packard, a computer industry pioneer, is cashing in on the marijuana ""green rush."" In a first for the fledgling marijuana industry, HP Inc. will start providing point-of-sale retail solutions, or registers, that come installed with software made for marijuana businesses. The $35 billion enterprise company, whose business is built on selling and installing complex tech products for other companies, is partnering with marijuana startup Flowhub on the first-of-its-kind retail offering. HP will manufacture the hardware, while Flowhub will handle the software side and sell the machines. These new registers are designed for stores where marijuana is sold (called dispensaries), and their software aims to help licensed business owners track sales and inventory, create reports, and stay compliant with state regulatory agencies by sending reports to them automatically. Times are changing There was a time not too long ago when a medical marijuana patient could only buy their legal cannabis with cash, because federal law prohibits banks and credit unions from taking marijuana money. Even when dispensaries started accepting debit and credit cards, some people still paid with cash or refused receipts because they didn't want to create a paper trail. But times are changing. With nine states and the District of Columbia having fully legalized marijuana, more than one in five Americans live in a state where they can legally enjoy the drug for recreational use. Legal marijuana sales hit $9.7 billion in 2017, a 33% increase over 2016. As marijuana legalization sweeps the nation and the stigma against the drug decreases, tech companies have set out to solve one of the biggest problems facing the industry: compliance. HP saw the legitimacy of the marijuana industry In addition to making laptops and printers, HP is one of the world's leading providers of point-of-sale retail solutions. The global point-of-sale market size reached nearly $48 billion in 2016. The marijuana industry opens up an entirely new revenue stream for the PC giant. Flowhub Kyle Sherman, who founded Flowhub in Denver, Colorado, the year after legal marijuana sales began, said HP approached his company about working together sometime in 2017. ""They read about us,"" Sherman told Business Insider. ""Obviously we knew about them."" In December, Flowhub welcomed representatives from HP's Retail Solutions Department to Denver for a tour of some large-scale marijuana dispensaries. Sherman said that the experience showed HP employees how regulated and ""really legit"" the marijuana industry has become. Earlier this year, HP started manufacturing the hardware for these point-of-sale systems. Flowhub installs its software and sells the machines to marijuana business owners. A handful of HP's systems have been in beta testing at select dispensaries since the start of the year. Aaron Weiss, HP's vice president and general manager for Retail Solutions, said in a statement, ""HP is delighted to be a key part of the solution in this exciting new regulated industry."" Flowhub The machine is metal and built to last, according to Sherman. His hope is that the system could someday replace iPads and computers that some marijuana businesses use as registers. IPads and computers might be cheaper solutions than some point-of-sale systems, but, Sherman said: ""You're getting a device that's going to break after six months or a year."" He added: ""These machines are doing a big job — an important job — so you want quality."" How Flowhub works Founded in 2015, Flowhub makes software for marijuana growers and sellers that allows them to monitor marijuana from "" seed to sale."" It collects and crunches data to ensure every leafy bud and marijuana product is handled in compliance with state law and federal guidelines. In practical terms, Flowhub helps marijuana businesses show the government that product isn't coming in from illegal cultivation sites or disappearing into the black market. During a typical transaction at a dispensary that uses Flowhub software, customers place their order with an employee and pay in cash, credit, or debit at the register. The point-of-sale system logs the transaction and tracks what inventory comes in and leaves the store. If there's a discrepancy in what inventory has been recorded and what's actually there — a problem known as shrinkage — a business owner can search the seed-to-sale platform to figure out a product's last known position in the supply chain and which employees handled it. Flowhub creates a sort of audit trail for all the product managed, which a business owner can provide if they're ever questioned by government authorities seeking proof of compliance. When business owners sync their registers to the cloud, the Flowhub platform sends sales reports automatically to Metrc, a database company that works with government agencies that regulate legalized marijuana. Flowhub currently serves marijuana businesses in Colorado, Oregon, Alaska, California, Michigan, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Nevada, which all use Metrc. Recreational marijuana is legal in nine states and medical marijuana is legal in 29 states. Skye Gould/Business Insider Flowhub processes over one million transactions every month, according to the company. With help from California's recreational marijuana market, Flowhub projects revenue will top $5 million in 2018. Big Tech is taking the leap into legal marijuana HP is the first major tech company to produce hardware for the marijuana industry. It joins another computer industry pioneer in tapping into the ""green rush."" In June 2016, Microsoft revealed it would start making seed-to-sale software from marijuana startup Kind Financial available through a cloud-based software suite that it distributes to state, county, and municipal governments. Kind's software helps regulatory agencies keep tabs on sales and commerce and gives entrepreneurs the comfort that comes with compliance. David Dinenberg, founder and CEO of Kind, told Business Insider that it wasn't easy convincing Microsoft, a 41-year-old company, to foray into marijuana. Kind appealed to Microsoft because it doesn't ""touch the plant,"" or have direct ties to growing or selling marijuana, according to Dinenberg. There's less risk involved for companies that provide ancillary products and services, even when the end-user deals in marijuana. ""At the end of the day, we are a technology company that provides services. We happen to cater to the marijuana industry, but we don't grow marijuana,"" Dinenberg said. The same thinking applies with the deal that HP struck with Flowhub. HP The hulking enteprise company is getting involved with the marijuana industry in a tangential way, but the event still marks a major milestone for both the technology and marijuana industries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,"How is this Markham weed farmer standing out from the cannabis crowd? Fish poop, that's how","In a landscape packed with mega-weed companies, and home-growing competition, the demand for creative ideas is high.",http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/joint-ventures-harvesting-1.4536121,2018-02-15T10:00:00Z,"Warren Bravo's first attempt at fish-based cultivation was a garden in his basement growing fresh vegetables for his family all year round. But when he was introduced to the medicinal properties of cannabis, the third-generation concrete contractor saw an opportunity he couldn't miss. He has since set up Green Relief, a 30 000 square-foot facility Markham that grows weed aquaponically; a sustainable process that uses fish waste as fertilizer. ""We feed the fish three times a day. The fish create solid waste,"" he explained. The waste then goes through a number of ""top secret"" processes. ""We've commercialized an eco-system, entirely scalable,"" Bravo said, adding that the fishy set-up doesn't affect the taste or smell of the weed. ""It's impossible for an animal pathogen to pass onto a plant,"" he asserted. Green Relief is one of the 89 companies licensed by Health Canada to cultivate and sell cannabis. The growth of Bravo's venture mirrors the expansion of much of the marijuana growing industry as legalization nears, by both existing licensed producers and new firms jumping in. Health Canada granted more than four times the number of licences in 2017 than it did in 2016. And in an exploding field, the pressure is high for producers to come with ideas to stand out from the crowd. Michael Lickver of Cannabis Wheaton says companies need an x-factor to distinguish themselves in an packed industry (Paul Borkwood/CBC) Bravo's calling card is his 4 500 square feet of aquaponics churning out ""a minimum of one pound of product per square foot,"" he said. Thanks to aquaponics, his company is reaping ""just shy of seven harvests per year. Nobody else gets that,"" Bravo claimed. And he plans to grow even more when he finishes putting up a second building that covers 210,000 square feet.. ""That'll be producing a hundred thousand pounds a year,"" he said. But while research numbers have estimated the demand at an explosive 600, 000 to 650 000 kilograms of weed a year in Canada, Miles Light, CEO of Colorado-based Marijuana Policy Group, says his firm is actually predicting an over-supply. ""If all of these licensed suppliers were to execute at 100 per cent they would be able to produce almost twice as much as the demand,"" he said. ""More than 1.1 million kilograms or more than 1,100 metric tons of cannabis is potentially going to come online in the next 18 to 24 months."" In such a packed landscape, the demand for creative ideas, like fish-waste farming is high. 'Secret sauce' ""There has to be some secret sauce or some x-factor,"" Mike Lickver, executive vice president of Cannabis Wheaton, explained in an interview. Cannabis Wheaton is a company that provides capital to cannabis companies, mainly medium to large-scale growers. But as companies chase a creative edge in production methods, they are bracing to come up against tight branding regulations. Their concern is that they won't be able to communicate their ""x-factor"" to customers in retail outlets. ""We continue to work with the federal government to encourage them to recognize that our product should have the same freedoms as substitute products — like alcohol — in terms of how we advertise and promote,"" said Darren Karusiuk, vice president of strategy at MedReleaf, a licensed weed producer. Health Canada's proposed regulations do not include plain packaging, but do say there must be ""strict limits on the use of colours, graphics, and other special characteristics of packaging to curtail the appeal of products to youth."" The federal agency also says packaging should also feature a health warning similar to those on tobacco products and must display the THC levels of the cannabis product within. Some producers fear that without the freedom to distinguish their product, many consumers may turn to competitors or even the home-grown option instead. Growing at home The legalization framework proposes to allow anyone to cultivate up to four plants in their own home. But growing cannabis is not as simple as throwing together seed, soil, sunlight and water and there will be a learning curve for recreational users come legalization. That's an opportunity that Ashley Athill intends to take advantage of. Ashley Athill is a teacher at The Ganja School in Kensington Market (CBC) Athill, who has a licence from Health Canada that allows her to grow weed and to distribute it to four registered medical patients, is also a teacher at The Ganja School at Hotbox Hydroponics in Kensington Market. After honing her skills as a child on her family's farm in Jamaica and then later with an agricultural science degree, she now teaches the basics of growing weed at home. ""From seed to cure and everything in between,"" she said. ""From ensuring you're in the right PH range, to ensuring that your environment is properly done, your temperatures, your humidity, there's a lot of different information that needs to be passed through to an individual before they start growing if they want to do it effectively,"" she said. As cannabis legalization looms in Canada, CBC Toronto takes a look at how businesses are affected by the green rush. Who will rise from the ashes and who will be left behind?

56,A massive Hamilton soccer complex is being sold off to make way for a marijuana producer,Stoney Creek sports complex Players Paradise has been sold to a marijuana producer in advance of pot legalization in Canada this fall.,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/players-paradise-sale-1.4800931,2018-08-28T14:47:24Z,"There'll be grass on the field at Players Paradise this winter — but definitely no kids playing ball. The Stoney Creek sports complex has been sold to a marijuana producer, as Canada is on the verge of pot legalization this fall. ""Players Paradise was approached by a real estate investment firm who has partnered with Green Relief, a medical cannabis company,"" said Cheryl Willberg, spokesperson for Players Paradise. ""They were looking for a facility in a specific geographic area with unique structural needs and required quick possession of the facility."" The sports complex is closing its doors as of Oct. 31 — and that's leaving some organizations scrambling. Sam Disanto, the president of the Saltfleet Stoney Creek Soccer Club, told CBC News that the owner of the complex issued a notice late last week that Players Paradise had been sold. Saltfleet, which had been based out of the complex for about ten years, has around 3,000 members there in programs ranging from youth soccer to elite teams. This building was full. It was benefiting a lot of people within the community. - Sam Disanto, president of the Saltfleet Stoney Creek Soccer Club Now, Saltfleet has been told they have 30 days to relocate, Disanto said, adding he was ""blindsided"" by the sale. ""It's pretty shocking,"" he said. Laurie Petrou's ten-year-old son plays for a Saltfleet team. She said she is immensely frustrated by the sale. ""If there was one hockey rink sold to a cannabis producer, there would be national outrage,"" she said. ""It just feels like a slap in the face."" Local cannabis companies are ramping up quickly as Canada's legalization date of Oct. 17 approaches. There's a push to hire growers, as well as technical and administrative staff. Data on legalized weed sales suggest retail value of some $2 billion in the first year in Ontario. It's a big business, and one that requires plenty of space. Radicle Inc., another production facility in the city with government contracts, told CBC News in a previous interview that it is looking to expand to a 150,000 square foot facility. Space is something Players Paradise has. The company's website describes the building as a ""state-of-the-art indoor sports facility"" with ""the latest in turf technology, 52-foot ceilings and premium amenities."" The fields consist of a FIFA approved 200-foot by 360-foot field that can be broken out into four playing fields of 90 feet by 200 feet. A 10,000 gallon tank was buried under the parking lot of the facility with a collection system in place to gather rainwater and recycle it throughout the building's toilets. The building's rubber infill turf system is made from recycled tires that have been broken down, cryogenically frozen, and then turned into turf. On top of Saltfleet, Players Paradise included tenants like Absolute Soccer, Global Fitness and GPS Academy. Disanto said Saltflet's programming will likely have to be scaled down this fall, as the group scrambles to find new office space, and places for kids to play in local gyms. ""This building was full. It was benefiting a lot of people within the community,"" Disanto said. ""It's tough to accept."" adam.carter@cbc.ca",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The blunt internal…",https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/oregons-medical-marijuana-program-admits-problems-56555819,2018-07-13T01:53:06Z,"The agency overseeing Oregon's legal medical marijuana industry conceded in a report Thursday it has not provided effective oversight of growers and others in the industry, creating opportunities for weed to be diverted to the black market. The blunt internal review echoes complaints from federal authorities that Oregon hasn't adequately controlled its marijuana businesses, and that overproduction of pot is feeding a black market in states that haven't legalized it. Oregon was one of the first states to legalize medical marijuana in 1998, and in 2014 voters approved allowing recreational use. The state's struggles to move what had for decades operated illegally in the shadows into a regulated industry set an example for other states moving toward legalization. Oregon Health Authority Director Patrick Allen ordered the internal review amid complaints from state and local law enforcement officials about lack of oversight of the pot industry. The health authority directs the state's Medical Marijuana Program, while the Liquor Control Commission regulates recreational pot. The review showed there were more than 20,000 grow sites, but only 58 inspections were carried out in 2017. The Oregon Medical Marijuana Program has far too few inspectors, while the tracking of growers and the pot they produce has been inadequate and inaccurate, the report concluded. ""Potentially erroneous reporting coupled with low reporting compliance makes it difficult to accurately track how much product is in the medical system,"" the report said. ""This limits OMMP's ability to successfully identify and address potential diversion."" The report said the medical marijuana oversight agency lacks reliable, independent tools to validate grow site locations and relies on inconsistent county databases. Law enforcement authorities say they often have trouble identifying which marijuana growers are legal. Seen from a helicopter just before harvest season, marijuana grows are like a green patchwork across one southwestern county, one drug enforcement officer recalled. In Deschutes County, the sheriff and district attorney in February went public with their frustrations, saying the state was allowing black market operations to proliferate through lack of oversight. They asked the Health Authority to provide a list of medical marijuana grow sites, but the agency refused, saying the law doesn't permit it to provide such a list. The agency could only respond on a case-by-case basis. Deschutes County District Attorney John Hummel commended OHA director Allen for ordering the study. The two met last month and agreed to use the results of the study to discuss improved oversight. In a statement, the health authority said the confidentiality of grow site addresses is protected by law, but added it's exploring ways to work more closely with law enforcement to ensure medical marijuana grow sites are operating legally. ""We are taking steps to maintain the integrity of Oregon's medical marijuana program and make sure medical products reach the patients who need them,"" Allen said. ""The actions we're taking include better tracking of growers, better enforcement, and making sure product that fails testing has been destroyed."" ——— Follow Andrew Selsky on Twitter at https://twitter.com/andrewselsky.

58,Deere Gets a Bump as Trump Farm Aid May Spur Tractor Buying,"When the Trump administration unveiled a $12 billion aid package for farmers on Tuesday, it wasn’t just soybean growers who had cause to cheer: So too did Deere & Co., one of the largest and most successful U.S. manufacturers.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-24/deere-gets-a-bump-as-trump-farm-aid-may-spur-tractor-buying,2018-07-24T22:34:54Z,"When the Trump administration unveiled a $12 billion aid package for farmers on Tuesday, it wasn’t just soybean growers who had cause to cheer: So too did Deere &amp; Co., one of the largest and most successful U.S. manufacturers. Shares of the world’s biggest tractor maker jumped as much as 4.8 percent after it emerged that the government was planning to compensate farmers who stand to lose export business amid escalating trade tensions with China. American farmers are the biggest market for Moline, Illinois-based Deere’s green-and-yellow machinery. Prices for the company’s models can run into several hundred thousand dollars apiece. As such, its fortunes are closely tied to the financial health of its customers. Those customers been battling low crop prices and falling incomes for years now. While there have been some positive developments in 2018 -- Deere raised its full-year sales forecast in May -- a looming trade war with American agriculture’s biggest customer, China, has clouded that outlook. China went ahead and imposed tariffs on soybeans earlier this month, pushing Chicago futures prices lower. U.S. farm profits were already projected to reach a 12-year low before the current trade tensions, and growers have been taking out more loans to keep afloat. Debt is rising steadily while incomes are being reduced, meaning that farmers will be more leveraged in 2018, according to the Kansas City Federal Reserve. The timing of the aid announcement raises hopes that growers could receive payments by the end of the year and bolster strained balance sheets, said Matt Splitter, a fifth-generation farmers who grows soybeans, corn, wheat and sorghum on about 4,000 acres in central Kansas. “It’s encouraging to see the administration taking a positive stance in helping the American farmer in tough times,” he said. Farmers can’t wait for resolutions to trade disputes, as they have to pay for land, equipment and other fixed costs amid plunging crop prices, he added. Trump’s $12 Billion in Farm Aid Panned by Republican Senators Government aid could make farmers more confident about their finances, and make them more likely to go on a buying binge at their tractor dealership, an activity they’ve been deferring for years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Deere and AGCO Corp., one of its largest rivals, have warned about negative impacts from a trade war. AGCO has said that tariffs are putting additional pressure on farmers, while Deere has stressed its support for open markets and free trade. “We strongly encourage officials to work toward a timely resolution to limit uncertainty for farmers and avoid any meaningful disruption to agricultural trade,” Deere spokesman Ken Golden said in a statement in April. Deere &amp; Co. posted their biggest intraday gain since May 18 before closing 3.2 percent higher at $139.84. The shares are down 11 percent this year.

Alex Wong/Getty Images Attorney General Jeff Sessions has knocked down an Obama-era policy shielding legal-marijuana businesses that comply with state laws. It's not clear how the new policy will be applied, but many in the industry are concerned about federal prosecution. Higher risk in that market will drive prices up and reward those who are willing to accept that risk — namely, drug traffickers. Attorney General Jeff Sessions' decision to rescind an Obama-era directive that made enforcing marijuana laws against companies that comply with state laws a "" low priority "" raised ire in both parties and stoked uncertainty in states where the drug is legal. The move may benefit nefarious actors who have long dominated the marijuana trade. Legal marijuana has already become a complex, multimillion-dollar industry in the US. Eight states and the District of Columbia have legalized it for recreational use. Sessions has been a fervent opponent, however, comparing marijuana to heroin and blaming it for increases in violence. The Justice Department said its new order ""simply directs all US Attorneys to use previously established prosecutorial principles that provide them all the necessary tools to disrupt criminal organizations, tackle the growing drug crisis, and thwart violent crime across our country."" Eron Silverstein, 51, right, shops for marijuana at the MedMen store in West Hollywood, California, January 2, 2018. Lucy Nicholson/Reuters The move sent a chill through the legal-marijuana market and spooked some investors. While some remain defiant and plan to continue their work, one party in particular stands to benefit if the new policy restricts legal sales and pushes prices up — Mexican drug traffickers who see marijuana as a kind of cash crop. Mexican marijuana growers and traffickers long benefited from low production costs and high demand in the US, which made the crop a lucrative one. Growers even adopted advanced methods pioneered in the US to expand their production. But they have seen their share of US marijuana market — and their profits — shrink as states pursue legalization. (Mexicans now bring safe, high-quality marijuana back to Mexico from the US, though US border agents in California will still seize the drug when they find it traveling south.) One farmer in Mexico's Sinaloa state — part of an area called the Golden Triangle for its prolific drug production — said in November that the value of marijuana had fallen from about $74 a kilo in 2010 to a little over $26 now. Seizures have fallen as well. US Customs and Border Protection officers at border crossings intercepted 522,614 pounds of marijuana in 2012, which rose to a high of 602,795 pounds in 2015 — but that figure fell to 338,676 pounds in 2017, according to data compiled by the Albuquerque Journal. The amount of marijuana seized between border crossings declined from 2.3 million pounds in 2012 to 861,231 in 2017. US border-patrol agents carry bales of marijuana they found along the highway near Ryan, Texas, about 20 miles from the US-Mexico border, March 28, 2017. (AP Photo/Rodrigo Abd) Meanwhile, Mexican producers — especially those in Sinaloa state — have moved heavily in the production of heroin and synthetic drugs like methamphetamine. ""The more you legalize marijuana, the more other drugs matter and become more profitable,"" Arturo Fontes, a former FBI agent and expert on Mexico’s drug cartels, told the Albuquerque Journal. ""And right now nothing matters more than meth, heroin."" The amount of meth seized at the US-Mexico border jumped from 14,131 pounds in 2012 to 44,065 pounds in 2017. The amount of meth seized between border crossings rose from 3,715 pounds in 2012 to 10,328 pounds in 2017, according to the Albuquerque Journal. Heroin seizures at border crossings have held steady, falling from 5,530 pounds in 2015 to 3,626 pounds in 2017, which was about the amount seized in 2012. The amount of heroin seized between border crossings has steadily risen, but is still below 1,000 pounds a year. A Mexican marine guards crystal-meth ingredients seized at a clandestine lab in the municipality of Badiraguato in Sinaloa state, June 12, 2009. Reuters The shift toward synthetics and opioids has been motivated by both marijuana legalization and by changing drug-use patterns in the US ""The cartels are very attuned to shifts in drug abuse in the United States. They always have been,"" Mike Vigil, former chief of international operations for the US Drug Enforcement Administration, told Business Insider in November. ""And as a result of that there's been a shift to the cultivation of opium poppies,"" which are used to make heroin, Vigil said. The dynamic going forward will likely hinge on how the Justice Department and its prosecutors enforce their new policy, Sanho Tree, director of the Drug Policy Project at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, DC, told Business Insider. ""Are they going to do eradication of indoor grows, arrest budtenders, or just prosecute some big players to set an example?,"" he said. Tree mentioned a controversial US attorney in San Francisco who targeted medicinal marijuana and marijuana dispensaries to illustrate one path the US policy might take. ""Would it be dozens of Melinda Haag's turned loose to hit targets of opportunity like she did to Harborside Dispensary? That would all affect how the Mexican market responds,"" Tree said. Farmworkers transport newly harvested marijuana plants at Los Suenos Farms, America's largest legal open-air marijuana farm, in Avondale, southern Colorado, October 4, 2016. Brennan Linsley/AP States have clashed with the federal government over marijuana, which remains illegal under federal law. The status of protections for medical marijuana going forward is not certain. Sessions' order gives prosecutor discretion in focusing their enforcement efforts — some may not ramp up efforts against marijuana, but others have said there's no guarantee they'll maintain a hands-off approach. Tree — who said the policy change restored a price support for growers by reintroducing a ""federal risk premium"" — told Business Insider that while consumers in states were marijuana was legal were probably used to a high-quality and tested product, he suspected cracking down on legal marijuana production and sales would incentivize trafficking of lower-quality marijuana to states where the drug is still illegal. ""Would Sessions go after the quality control &amp; testing chain as well?"" he added. ""That would make pot more dangerous and run counter to his professed goals."" ""One thing is clear: Sessions has reversed the precipitous decline in marijuana prices with a stroke of his stupid pen,"" Tree said. ""As prices go up, it will draw risk-tolerant players willing to cash in on neo-prohibition.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Now this one,"" Shade, 57, says gently cupping another avocado, ""even though it has a little black on the peel, is not going to make the size that's in the sweet spot for us. And it takes someone who has been at it for a long time to tell the difference."" Shade will need 50 harvesters for peak season. Right now, he has 25. He's tried to hire more, but a skilled crew is becoming harder to find: The workforce he's relied on is aging and he's having a hard time finding people to replace them. ""Many of the harvesters I remember from when I was just a teenager - they're still harvesting,"" he says. Even though he pays well above minimum wage, he's also lost workers to farms that can afford to pay more. The experienced harvesters at Shade's farm can make up to $400 a day, he says. The rookies start off at minimum wage and then move up to $200 to $300 a day after a few weeks. Finding workers, especially at peak harvesting season, is a problem many of the nation's farmers face. Related: How America's immigrant workforce is changing According to the Department of Labor, nearly half of the farm workers in the United States are undocumented immigrants. But decades of inconsistent immigration policies have helped to create a labor shortage -- and recent crackdowns at the border are further depleting the already short supply of workers. Rick Shade in one of the avocado groves on his farm in California. Farmers can participate in the H-2A guest farm worker visa program, which provides temporary visas to workers for up to 10 months, then requires them to return home after the season. But the application system is often difficult to navigate. According to a study by the American Farm Bureau Federation, the H-2A process is so grueling, farmers have had to hire lawyers to help. Of those who made it through, 72% of growers said administrative delays caused workers to arrive weeks after the needed date. Plus, the program is expensive. Farmers must provide workers with housing, transportation to and from their home country and workers' compensation insurance. ""The H-2A is a difficult process, especially living in this beautiful spot in Southern California,"" Shade said, citing the state's high land values and tough regulations regarding housing. ""When you bring in an H-2A employee or employees, you have to provide housing that is up to government specifications. If I were to hit the Lotto... I might be able to purchase an old run down motel and convert it. But that's the order of magnitude we're talking about for labor and it's just not feasible."" To lessen their dependence on workers, farmers across the country are scrambling to mechanize. Agricultural technology -- basically using robots to replace workers -- is now a multibillion dollar industry. Investors poured $4.6 billion into food and agriculture technology startups in 2015 alone. Despite major advancements in technology, some crops, like avocados are too difficult to mechanize and require a specific skill set. Related: Farmers say they have a lot to lose in a trade war ""The crops that are most affected are the ones that use hired labor,"" explains Daniel Sumner, director of the University of California, Agricultural Issues Center at UC Davis, pointing to avocados, berries and tree fruits. ""It's really now through the rest of the summer that we're going to hear more and more farmers and farm workers rushing to get a harvest in with really not enough labor force to do it. And that's a real challenge. It may mean that we have crops rotting in the fields."" Back at Shade's farm, he watches a group of workers pick avocados. Equipped with a 20-foot tall poll that has a rucksack on the end, one of the men ascends into the treetops. Using one hand for stability on the teetering ladder, he swings his body out. In one fluid motion he snaps an avocado bunch and puts it into the giant canvas bag slung over his small frame. ""Every avocado has to be clipped from the tree by hand,"" Shade beams. ""I don't care which diet you're on - Keto, Paleo, whatever - everybody still eats. We need people that are willing to work hard and sweat in agriculture to get the food to the table.""

61,Brits don't want to work on farms – so who will pick fruit after Brexit?,"Just one per cent of farm workers are British. Most currently come from Eastern Europe, but with the end of free movement, British growers could have to look even further for labour",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-agriculture-farms-fruit-picking-migrant-workers-labour-shortage-a8469806.html,2018-08-04T14:07:22Z,"After a dozen futile calls to big farms, agricultural lobbyists and labour contractors, we finally found him. The rarest of the rare, the British berry picker. Meet Max Hughes, a 20-year-old university student and history major, who is spending his summer harvesting blackcurrants at the Snell family farm in Herefordshire. He rides in the back of a harvester all day, standing beside a Czech migrant and a couple of sun-bronzed Romanian guys, who know very little English. British fruit farmer cuts hundreds of jobs over Brexit uncertainty “No matter, you can't hear a thing they say over the noise,” Hughes says, gesturing towards the wheeled harvester beside him. Its vibrating metal fingers shake the currant bushes and bring the tart berries via conveyor belt to the sorting table, where Hughes and his teammates discard the leaves, twigs, slugs and occasional mouse – whatever you don't want to see in a frozen fruit pack. Britain today is completely dependent on foreign workers to pick its fruit and vegetables. According to the National Farmers Union, an industry lobbying group, of the 60,000 seasonal workers in the fields last year, barely one per cent was British. The vast majority come from Eastern Europe, particularly Bulgaria and Romania. As long as Britain has remained part of the European Union, by treaty its doors have been wide open to the “ free movement ” of fellow members, including those seasonal farmworkers who come for four or five months, get paid in British pounds and return home for the winter. British university student Max Hughes took a summer job at the AJ &amp; CI Snell farm in Herefordshire (The Washington Post/Alice Zoo) But as Britain prepares to leave the EU, bringing the era of free movement to a close, farmers have begun to panic: Who will pick the crops next spring? Already, labour shortages driven by economic shifts have left produce rotting in the strawberry fields and the high-tech, hydroponic poly-tunnels where top-tier soft fruit is produced. Jacqui Green, chief executive of the Berry Gardens growers cooperative, reports a 30 to 40 per cent shortfall in labour this year. “It's pretty grim,” Green says. “And it's probably going to get worse before it potentially gets better, post- Brexit.” During the 2016 Brexit campaign, anxiety over mass migration was top of mind, fuelled in part by claims that, for example, millions of Muslims would arrive as soon as Turkey joined the EU. (Turkey is not in the union and has no prospect of joining in the foreseeable future.) For workers at the Snell farm, the days typically start at 5am and end late in the afternoon (The Washington Post/Alice Zoo) With Britain's exit from the bloc, Theresa May vows that the country will regain “control of our borders” and dramatically curtail immigration. Yet critics of Brexit argue that Britain desperately needs foreign workers – not only “the best and brightest” in finance, tech and medicine, who May promises will still be welcome, but those who clean hotel rooms in Brighton, man kitchens in London and harvest tomatoes in Norfolk. If far fewer workers come from Europe, those jobs will have to be filled by Brits – who don't seem very keen, truth be told – or contracted from Belarus or Nepal or the Philippines. Britain had such a foreign farmworker scheme in the past, but it was scrapped – and now there are growing calls to restart it. Stephanie Maurel, the chief executive of Concordia, a recruitment company that supplies workers to about 200 British farms, says they've had virtually zero Brits apply. “We've had two applications out of 10,000,” she says. “It's statistically quite damning.” Asked why Brits aren't high on the work, she recited the list: early hours, long days, physical toll, seasonality, lack of affordable transport, “and, quite simply, the farms aren't in places with high levels of unemployment.” And, unless you're a local, you live in a trailer. Often a nice trailer, with wifi, but still. Maurel says some Brits work in less taxing farm jobs – as logistics managers or office staff – but even those higher paying, indoor jobs are mostly taken by Eastern Europeans these days. She says the rare British workers who give the fruit and vegetable harvest a try, “literally don't last a week”. Hughes and three other university students are the only Brits harvesting berries at the Snell family farm this summer, out of a workforce of 300. “That's quite something, isn't it?” says Christine Snell who owns the award-winning, environmentally sensitive farm with her husband, Anthony. “We want to get the message across: If we could recruit British workers, we would, but we cannot.” Snell drove a Washington Post reporter out to see these exotic British berryworkers. They looked hot and dusty but otherwise like healthy contestants on a reality TV show. For Hughes, the long workday begins at 5am and ends in the late afternoon. He says with overtime and bonuses for quick sorting, he could make more than £3000 for six weeks of six-day work. The worst part, he says, is the dull, repetitive nature of the job. He zones out by listening to music through his ear buds. “It's not a bad summer job,” he says. When workers sort blackcurrants at the Snell farm, the delicate fruit must be handled with care (The Washington Post/Alice Zoo) But he and his mates think they understand why so few Brits want farm jobs. “A lot of kids would never do this kind of work,” says Lewis Hiscox, 24, a recent graduate from Harper Adams University, who was working on the blackcurrant harvester, too. “They'd rather give London a try for more money, more fun. Also, there's the snob thing. Farm work is associated with Eastern Europeans,” meaning “work for poor people”. Many observers have suggested that Brits today are “too lazy” to do the farm work of their yeoman ancestors. Hiscox says that physically, “the British worker could definitely do this job.” He says the work provides an “outdoor life” and decent pay for a young person. Elliot Packham, 22, who just graduated from Cardiff University, wondered, “If the pay were better, more might try?” He noted that then strawberries would cost more. “So there's the economics of it,” he says. Some British commentators have suggested that maybe recently released felons could be employed on the farms – the way German prisoners of war were used during World War II. Crew leader Gabriela Yuganaru is from Romania (The Washington Post/Alice Zoo) Others have wondered if hale and hearty Britons living on social welfare benefits could be prodded to bend their backs to bring in a crop of strawberries. (Though those who receive such benefits may question if the work would be worth the risk of not requalifying for benefits after the season ends.) Gabriela Yuganaru, a 50-year-old Romanian crew leader on the Snell farm, has been picking for 10 years. “If it was so hard, why would I come back? Your back is sore, OK? A fast picker can make 100 pounds in a day.” She says, “Maybe the government gives people too much money not to work. I don't know.” She says back home the governments are not so generous. “Better to work,” she says. Helen Whately, a Conservative party politician who chairs the all-party parliamentary group for fruit and vegetable farmers, says growers would be facing a shortage of labour without Brexit, but the vote to leave the EU has “arguably made the problem a bit more acute.” Already, it has contributed to a weakening of the pound, thus decreasing the financial incentives for foreign workers, at the same time that economies are improving in source countries, such as Romania. Whately is campaigning for a seasonal agricultural workers scheme that could include countries outside of the EU and would allow pickers to come and work for a defined and limited period of time. Other than that? Robots? But berries are notoriously difficult to pick mechanically, Snell says. Adrian Cirstea, the packing house and logistics manager at the Snell farm, who is originally from Romania, imagines that after Brexit, British growers will have look far and wide for labour. “They'll have to go further east and further south,” he says, to Africa and Asia, to find workers. Meaning that Britain may see the same number of foreign farmworkers, but fewer Bulgarians and more from Eritrea and Moldova. Maybe even Turkey. © The Washington Post The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.

62,Homegrown ambition: St. John's business poised to profit from pot,"​Even if we're pounded by blizzard after blizzard, one downtown St. John's store is promising a green Christmas.",http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/greenery-marijuana-store-1.4401115,2017-11-15T09:30:00Z,"Even if we're pounded by blizzard after blizzard, one downtown St. John's store is promising a green Christmas. ""Most Newfoundlanders — we bottle our own beer, we cork our own wine, we probably should grow our own vine as well,"" said Ross Barney, co-owner and manager of Greenery. When Barney says ""vine,"" he means marijuana. It's something Greenery hopes to sell eventually but until legislative changes decriminalize marijuana, the new business will help people grow their own. ""Consider us a test case. We would love to work with law enforcement and the justice department and become a dispensary of medical marijuana,"" he said. ""But in the meantime, we'll have a cafe and I'll be happy to sell you a grow tent and you can have yourself a green Christmas."" Greenery is setting up on the east-end of Duckworth Street in St. John's.(Mark Quinn/CBC) Greenery, due to open in late November, is one of a number of businesses in St. John's hoping to profit when marijuana is made legal next year. Besides the cafe Barney talked about, the shop will sell growing products, and smoking accessories typical in a headshop. It will also have an educational component. ""In the back of our store we're going to teach seminars where people can come in, first time growers, and learn from other experienced growers how to grow their own marijuana,"" said Barney. Not decided who will sell When marijuana is decriminalized, each province will have to determine how it is sold. Newfoundland and Labrador hasn't announced its plan yet but Barney is hoping the province will not decide to sell exclusively through pharmacies or through the Newfoundland Liquor Corporation. Greenery is selling tents that help people grow their own plants.(Mark Quinn/ CBC) ""I think we should follow what Manitoba and Saskatchewan are looking at right now where the government will control the stream of the product and distribute it to small independent business owners like myself,"" he said. ""So I hope it's an opportunity to create new business here in St. John's. Especially when St. John's needs this new business."" N.L. still hasn't set regulations for marijuana, but one shop owner is hoping to keep pot out of the NLC1:39 Barney's convinced even if that doesn't happen, Greenery will still be a viable business with the selling of smoking accessories, growing equipment, and its teaching seminars. He believes Newfoundland and Labrador should strive to produce all the marijuana that's consumed in the province. ""I hope one day I can buy marijuana from a Newfoundland grower and sell it because we're a local business. So we can keep things here in Newfoundland if we wanted to,"" Barney said. ""Imagine if Sprung greenhouse existed today, that would be some greenhouse,"" he said, a reference to a failed $22-million investment by the Brian Peckford government in cucumber production during the late 1980s. Federal government preparing changes In June, federal Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould announced the launch of a task force to advise the Canadian government on how best to map its plan to legalize marijuana. The House of Commons is expected to send proposed legislative changes, Bill C–45, to the Senate before Christmas But recently concerns have been raised that the Senate may delay plans to change the legislation governing marijuana in Canada by July 1. Greenery plans sell items such as pipes and tents for growing plants until marijuana is decriminalized in 2018.(Mark Quinn/ CBC) Members of Parliament and committees have already been wrestling with a host of concerns with the bill, such as whether police are properly prepared to deal with the change and what restrictions should be in place regarding growing marijuana at home.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63,Here's how Brexit will affect each ingredient of the full English breakfast,"Your eggs and toast will probably be fine, but if you enjoy sausages, bacon and tomatoes with your fry-up you may want to start stocking up now",https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-cost-import-ingredients-full-english-breakfast-eu-a8377201.html,2018-05-31T11:02:46Z,"The typical full English breakfast might include sausages, bacon, eggs, mushrooms, tomato, baked beans, hash browns and toast. Here’s how Brexit could affect the UK’s most important meal of the day. Eggs Let’s start with the good news. The British egg industry can produce enough for the country to be entirely self-sufficient in eggs. In light of the recent scare concerning contaminated eggs imported from Dutch farms, it is unnecessary (other than for cost reasons) for UK supermarkets to use cheaper, foreign-sourced eggs for processed products. So if you fancy eggs for breakfast, Brexit is unlikely to have any effect on this staple. Bread Bread is made from wheat and about 85 per cent of the wheat used by UK flour millers is home grown. The majority of the flour produced in the UK is also used there. Only about 1 per cent of UK flour sales are based on imports of flour, whereas about 2 per cent is exported. Canadian wheat is imported due to its excellent characteristics which work well blended with UK wheats. Depending on the quality of the UK crop, wheat may also be imported from France and Germany. So unless you are after a croissant which requires the softer French wheat, your breakfast toast should not be affected by Brexit. Sausages and bacon Forget Brexit, we need to start talking about potholes Now for the less good news. Britain’s breakfast sausages and bacon are dependent on the availability and cost of pork. British farmers currently produce only 40 per cent of the pork eaten in the UK. The other 60 per cent comes from EU countries such as Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands. European producers are able to provide pork more cheaply than British farmers who have additional costs related to higher animal welfare standards – 40 per cent of the British pig herd is bred outdoors. So a hard Brexit would probably lead to a rise in the cost of sausages and bacon, until such a time as the British pork industry recovers sufficiently to supply enough happy pigs. Hash browns Although the UK still ranks number 11 in the world among potato producing countries, the harvested area has shrunk by half since 1960 and demand exceeds supply. Mediterranean countries are often the largest source of fresh potato imports to the UK. These usually include new potatoes from both EU and non-EU countries (such as Israel), as well as potatoes from the near continent (principally Holland, Belgium and France). Frozen, processed potatoes account for the largest proportion of UK imports. Average prices are lower for imported frozen products than those domestically produced with the majority of frozen potato imports coming from the Netherlands and Belgium. This means that if your hash browns come in frozen form, Brexit could make them more expensive.

Mushrooms Mushrooms are a relatively new crop in the UK and the industry itself is young, dominated by a single species of mushroom. Mushrooms which can be grown in the UK have seen massive drops in production due to the industry being dominated by a few big companies. The production area of mushrooms has decreased since 2007 from 126 to 86 hectares. One company based in Ireland dominates production and mushroom growers in Ireland rely on the UK for 80% of sales. Other countries that export mushrooms to the UK are Poland, Belgium and the Netherlands. Recently, G’s Growers Ltd, an independent Producer Organisation, has made a major investment in a new mushroom growing facility in Cambridgeshire in response to demand for UK-grown mushrooms. But, to complicate matters, the mushroom industry in the UK employs predominantly Eastern European pickers. This indicates that Brexit will have a double-edged effect on mushrooms, with increased prices and shortages due to availability of labour. Tomatoes We need to get rid of the great British breakfast And now for some really bad news. Tomatoes grow where it is hot, and require a long growing season. To combat its climate, the British tomato industry has more than 200 hectares of glasshouses. Despite this, British tomato production amounts to only about a fifth of the total volume of tomatoes sold in the country each year. About 400,000 tonnes of fresh tomatoes are imported from EU countries such as Spain, the Netherlands, Poland, Italy and Belgium, and non-EU countries such as Morocco and Israel. The UK is nowhere near tomato self-sufficiency, and a hard Brexit would definitely mean more expensive tomatoes. Baked beans Beans – haricot, navy or phaseolus vulgaris – cannot be grown in Britain. They are all imported – mostly from North America, although scientists are mapping DNA in an attempt to create a strain that will survive in the UK. Breakfast favourite baked beans require haricot beans. People in the UK consume about 2,000 tonnes of baked beans every year. But baked beans aren’t just beans. They also contain a spice mixture, tomato sauce, starch, sugar and vinegar. So although Brexit may not have a direct impact on imports from North America, the fact that baked beans contain tomatoes could influence their price. So, if you can reduce your breakfast to just eggs and toast, you might not even notice Brexit. But if you want that full English medley, Brexit may not be your cup of tea.

64,Medical marijuana seen at risk following move by Sessions,"When U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions green-lighted federal prosecutions of marijuana lawbreakers, the vast majority of U.S. states that allow some form of medical marijuana were unexpectedly placed at risk of a crackdown and are warily watching developmen…",http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/medical-marijuana-risk-move-sessions-52171286,2018-01-05T23:02:28Z,"When U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions green-lighted federal prosecutions of marijuana lawbreakers, the vast majority of U.S. states that allow some form of medical marijuana were unexpectedly placed at risk of a crackdown and are warily watching developments. Forty six states — including Sessions' home state of Alabama — have legalized some form of medical marijuana in recent years, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Eight of those states also allow recreational marijuana. Among the guidance that Sessions rescinded was the so-called Ogden Memorandum of 2009 that instructed federal prosecutors not to pursue cases against medical marijuana patients and distributors who complied with state laws. ""Previous nationwide guidance specific to marijuana enforcement is unnecessary and is rescinded, effective immediately,"" Sessions told the U.S. attorneys based in all 50 states in a letter Thursday. Georgia state Rep. Allen Peake, a Republican who sponsored a bill in his state's legislature that legalized possession of medical marijuana in 2015, denounced the move. ""I'm very disappointed in Jeff Session's actions,"" Peake said Friday in a telephone interview. ""He will be hurting the grandfather with Alzheimer's, the soccer mom with breast cancer, the college student with Crohn's disease, the young child with seizures — these are the people that will be impacted by this action by the attorney general."" The only legal protection now for medical marijuana growers, processors, sellers and users is a temporary measure sponsored by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) and Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) prohibiting the U.S. Department of Justice from using government funds to target them. Rohrabacher, in a conference call with reporters and four other members of Congress, said Sessions' move should galvanize national support for marijuana legalization. ""This is a wakeup call for American people who believe in freedom,"" Rohrabacher said. ""It will mobilize people throughout the country."" Many politicians, including Republicans, have cast Session's move as an infringement on states' rights. Only Idaho, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas do not allow any access to marijuana, said Karmen Hanson, a cannabis policy analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures. Many of the states that allow some form of medical marijuana did so in 2013 and 2014. About half of the initiatives have been passed by voters in ballot measures, and the rest by state legislatures, Hanson said. Georgia's General Assembly passed that state's medical marijuana law in 2015. Called Haleigh's Hope Act, it was named for a girl who was suffering from hundreds of seizures a day. ""This means the world to us,"" Haleigh's mother, Janea Cox, told reporters when Georgia's governor signed the bill. Peake said Sessions' move will have a chilling effect on new state legislation he plans to introduce that would allow the growing, processing and distribution of cannabis oil in Georgia. ""This is as bipartisan an issue as you can get,"" he said. ""Cancer doesn't ask if you're a Republican or a Democrat. There are people of all races and creeds who benefit from medical cannabis, so that's why it's so crucial that Congress get together and take action."" The Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment that restricts U.S. attorneys from taking legal action against people who use medical marijuana or produce it was maintained in a last short-term funding bill passed by Congress. But that funding bill expires on Jan. 19. Blumenauer ""is working to make sure it's maintained again in whatever next funding bill Congress passes,"" said his spokeswoman, Nicole L'Esperance. Rohrabacher said a better, more permanent solution is a bill he submitted last year that amends the Controlled Substances Act so it doesn't apply to people who produce, possess or delivers marijuana in compliance with state laws governing recreational and medical marijuana. If it passes, Rohrabacher said he and Blumenauer would not be forced to repeatedly seek passage of their amendment annually. New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker has also introduced a bill to legalize marijuana at the federal level. ——— Follow Andrew Selsky on Twitter at https://twitter.com/andrewselsky",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65,"Grapes, strawberries destroyed by severe frost","Grape and strawberry growers In New Brunswick are still assessing the damage, which has been significant, to their crops after a severe frost in the wee hours of Monday morning.",http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/vineyards-winteries-new-brunswick-magnetic-hill-zach-everett-1.4695443,2018-06-07T15:09:48Z,"Grape and strawberry growers In New Brunswick are still assessing the damage, which has been significant, to their crops after a severe frost in the wee hours of Monday. ""You could take your fingernails and scrape the frost off the aluminum irrigation pipes,"" said David Walker of the Sunset U-pick in Fredericton.. He told Information Morning Fredericton that it was his irrigation system that allowed him to save most of his 10 acres of strawberry plants after temperatures dropped to –4 C and –5 C in some areas of the province. David Walker from Sunset U-Pick in Fredericton says ""every year you're fighting the frost"" but this year is severe. He shares how the frost has affected the berry patch and what they're doing to mitigate the loss.9:01 ""If you sprinkle the water on the plants, the water freezes, which saves the flowers from freezing and so on Monday we irrigated from about 4:10 until about 8 o'clock and we saved about 85 to 90 per cent of the flowers,"" he said. Walker estimates the damage will still cost him $20,000. For the Magnetic Hill Winery in Moncton, the damage could be even more costly. Co-owner Zach Everett said it was ""pretty discouraging"" to see his vineyard covered in white on Monday morning. ""With grapes or perennial fruit, it takes years to recuperate from something like this, so we're actually scared of the production for next year... really the next week or two will tell how severe next year's losses could even be,"" he said. ""In May it is one thing, but a frost in June is a completely different thing. Pretty much unheard of."" Many vineyards 'decimated' Everett visited vineyards in Cap-Pelé and Kent County this week and said for some the frost damage has been devastating. ""On Monday I personally walked through over 50 acres of vines that are decimated. One hundred per cent loss. It's very disheartening."" Everett said with so much damage to his vineyard, he will now begin removing the damaged parts of the plants by hand. ""We're into something that we've never seen before, so there's actually a learning curve to how to get over or overcome this hurdle,"" he said. ""It's just like it came out of the freezer and it gets limp, it gets discoloured — what ends up happening is the water in the cells of the green growth froze and thawed and it kills the vine."" Walker doesn't have crop insurance and even if he did his losses weren't large enough to be covered, he said. ""In most of those insurance programs you have to lose anywhere from 20 to 30 per cent of your crop before they even kick in, so you just suck it up is what you do... it's very difficult to predict and manage and you just kind of roll with the punches,"" he said. Frosty nights still possible Everett said that on the bright side, Magnetic Hill Winery is well positioned to ""survive a crisis like this."" I really feel for those people in Maugerville — I mean they've taken a huge hit from the flood this year and then we get this. - David Walker ""We have a great abundance of things like strawberries and rhubarb and blueberries, maple syrup, so the consumers won't see less bottles on the shelves. They'll just be different bottles."" Walker said for him, it is upsetting to see the bright yellow centres of the strawberry blossoms now black, but he knows it could have been much worse. ""I really feel for those people in Maugerville — I mean they've taken a huge hit from the flood this year and then we get this."" It has been a particularly bad spring for frost, Walker said, with Monday's by far the worst. And meteorologists say the Maritimes aren't out of the woods yet, with cold, clear nights still in the forecast. Sunshine will warm inland spots to low 20's today... thank goodness! A cold front moves into NW NB tonight then passes on Friday with spotty showers or thunderstorms. Still 20's inland. &lt;br&gt;Fairly fine weekend, but chilly nights behind the front (frost??) &lt;a href=""https://t.co/QmY0AKqF7n""&gt;pic.twitter.com/QmY0AKqF7n&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; @YHZweatherguy Walker said the cool weather has set his strawberries back, but people will most likely be able to start picking on the first of July.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
66,Supermarkets could see lettuce shortage as heatwave causes 'havoc' for British growers,Salad greens could disappear from shelves in next fortnight as temperatures halt production,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-weather-lettuce-shortage-britain-heatwave-supermarkets-growing-wilting-a8424446.html,2018-06-30T12:09:41Z,"Britain’s summer heatwave could see lettuces disappear from supermarket shelves across the UK, growers have warned. The warm weather has seen a spike in demand for the salad vegetable, with around 18 million heads sold in Britain last week alone, five million more than in the same period last year. However, experts say the heat is causing chaos for lettuce producers in the UK, with shortages expected to become apparent in shops within the next fortnight. “The soaring summer temperatures are causing havoc for the UK’s leafy salad growers,” said Dieter Lloyd, spokesman for trade body the British Leafy Salad Growers Association ( BLSGA ). UK faces beer shortage during World Cup and barbecue season “The record temperatures have stopped the lettuce crop growing, when the mercury hits 30C lettuces can’t grow. “In all of the major growing areas, from Cupar in Fife, through Preston, to Ely in East Anglia and Chichester, Sussex, the hot weather has affected all our growers. “We may be seeing some gaps on retailers’ shelves in the next two weeks as the heatwave continues.” The BSLGA said consumers may see lettuce from the other side of the Atlantic appear in supermarkets as retailers aim to meet demand. Southern Europe, where Britain sources many of its salad crops during the winter, will also be too warm to produce lettuce in summer months. Salad leaves are not the only crop to be effected by the warm weather. Producers have reported concerns over vegetables such as broccoli, which also stop growing if conditions become too hot.

The Trump administration announced Thursday that it was ending an Obama-era policy to tread lightly on enforcing U.S. marijuana laws. The declaration renewed anxiety, confusion and uncertainty that has long shadowed the bright green leafy drug still forbidden under federal law but now legal in a majority of states as medicine and in a handful of those for recreational purposes. ""Everybody is super worried. My phone has been going off the hook,"" said Terry Blevins, who runs a security firm and is part-owner of a marijuana distribution company in Southern California. ""They are all, 'What does this mean?... Is the federal government going to come into California"" to raid businesses? Officials wouldn't say if federal prosecutors would target pot shops and legal growers, nor would they speculate on whether pot prosecutions would increase. The action by Attorney General Jeff Sessions was not unexpected given his longtime opposition to pot, but comes at a heady time for the industry as retail pot sales rolled out New Year's Day in California. In 2013, President Barack Obama's attorney general advised prosecutors not to waste money targeting pot growers and sellers that were abiding by state laws, but to go after flagrant violations such as trafficking across state lines or selling to minors. Under this policy, several states legalized recreational pot, growers and sellers had begun to drop their guard over fears of a federal crackdown and the business blossomed into a sophisticated, multimillion-dollar industry feeding state government programs with tax dollars. Sessions and some law enforcement officials blame legalization for a number of problems, including trafficking black market weed. Authorities are also concerned about stoned drivers and fear that widespread acceptance of the drug could increase its youth appeal. Advocates for the drug that is classified in federal law in the same category as heroin have argued that it has medicinal qualities and causes less harm than alcohol. They have said the government needs to focus on rampant opioid abuse and allow a regulated marijuana market that will reduce crime by eliminating the need for a black market. Pot proponents along with some members of Congress, including Sessions' fellow Republicans, roundly condemned the change in direction Thursday and said it was an intrusion upon the rights of states whose voters had approved use of the drug. ""If... Congress allows the Department (of Justice) to crack down on individuals and state governments, it will be one of the biggest derelictions of duty I will have witnessed,"" said U.S. Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska. ""Congress is the voice of the people and we have a duty to do what is right by the states."" Some sheriffs in California welcomed the news, particularly in the northern part of the state where the majority of weed has been grown illegally for decades and enforcement of laws largely falls to rural authorities with limited budgets. Yuba County Sheriff Steve Durfor said he's hopeful Sessions' actions signal a new willingness of federal authorities to help the impoverished region enforce marijuana laws. His department outside Sacramento has struggled to slow a large and growing influx of illegal operations setting up shop in the region. Officers destroyed a record 30,000 plants last year, surpassing the previous record of 8,800 plants destroyed in 2016. Colorado's U.S. attorney, Bob Troyer, said his office won't change its approach to prosecution, despite Sessions' guidance. Prosecutors there have always focused on marijuana crimes that ""create the greatest safety threats"" and will continue to be guided by that, he said. In Oregon, U.S. Attorney Billy J. Williams said he would maintain the same level of enforcement and focus on unlicensed production of marijuana and smuggling out of state. Before the Obama administration put the policy in place, the feds sent shivers through the medical marijuana community by threatening landlords and operators with property seizure notices, resulting in many shops shutting down in cities where they were considered a nuisance. Federal prosecutors also sued and prosecuted some nonprofit dispensaries that were raking in money or dealing to people with no medical need, though the latter was hard to prove in a state like California, where regulations were loose at best. It was not clear how Thursday's announcement might affect states where marijuana is legal for medical purposes. A congressional amendment blocks the Justice Department from interfering with medical marijuana programs in states where it is allowed. Justice officials said they would follow the law, but would not preclude the possibility of medical-marijuana related prosecutions. Sessions' decision led to a skid in prices for marijuana-related stocks that had surged for weeks surrounding California pot sales. Officials denied the timing of the announcement was connected to California sales, which are projected to bring in $1 billion annually in tax revenue within several years. In addition to stock market losses, the change in policy in the short-term could chill investments in a burgeoning industry that will also see Canada and Massachusetts begin to allow recreational sales in July, experts said. However, many suggested that a large-scale crackdown was unlikely given the industry's size. ""Legal marijuana has become so entrenched in the U.S. — it's a multi-billion-dollar industry,"" said Don Morse, director of the Oregon Cannabis Business Council. ""I don't see the people who are behind this, people like myself, rolling over for the Justice Department."" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said the state, which along with Colorado in 2012 were the first to allow retail pot sales, would continue marijuana operations. ""We should, in my book, not push the panic button on either your individual lives or your businesses,"" Inslee said. At Harborside in Oakland, one of California's largest shops, founder and CEO Steve DeAngelo said it was business as usual and he wanted to assure customers not to fear shopping there. ""We've been targeted by the federal government before and we stand up and we fight for our rights,"" DeAngelo said. ""Six months from now if U.S. attorneys have not taken Jeff Sessions up on this crazy offer, then I think that it absolutely makes no difference to anybody."" ——— Gurman reported from Washington.

68,"This Mother's Day, florists and farms say consider buying US-grown flowers",Florist says she sees trend toward buying more US-grown flowers for the holidays.,https://abcnews.go.com/US/mothers-day-florists-farms-buying-us-grown-flowers/story?id=53086448,2018-05-09T02:32:23Z,"When it comes to Mother's Day, Emily Thompson knows how to send the right message of love and gratitude in the language of flowers. Thompson, whose floral shop in Manhattan is named after her, hails from Vermont but now lives in New York City. Thompson, whose shop features many U.S.-grown materials from New Jersey and California, said she feels very strongly about supporting U.S. farmers. And she's noticed that her customers were starting to think more locally as well. US-grown flowers can be more expensive, Emily Thompson said, but there are several reasons to buy them including carbon footprint. The foliage she uses comes from Puerto Rico. We're bringing their seasonality and their landscape home with them. David Muir speaks with florist Emily Thompson in New York City. Thompson said recently that her shop supports US farmers and she's noticed that customers are starting to ask for local flowers as well. ""There's a beginning of a movement that relates a lot to the movement that's happened with food,"" she said. ""They're looking for something that evokes the season and evokes the landscape right outside their door."" Thompson said she'd also seen an increase in the number of people interested in growing their own flowers. The shop also sells ranunculus, which Emily Thompson gets from Hautau &amp; Sons in Branchville, New Jersey. Thompson said the farm grows an incredibly variety of the flower. All of the flowers in her shop are not grown in the U.S., she said, but the U.S. growers she uses include Green Valley Floral in Salinas, California, as well as New Jersey's Hautau &amp; Sons. In addition to its 80 rose varieties, Green Valley grows 20 varieties of lilies and 80-plus varieties of gerberas. The farm has been in the flower business for more than 45 years and employs 45 full-time workers. Hautau &amp; Sons, a family-run business, produces ranunculus year-round. During peak season, it employs 10-12 workers. While Thompson said that some U.S.-grown flowers can be more expensive, she said locally grown flowers usually last very well because they do not withstand a long travel time. She also said that in addition to reducing the carbon footprint, buying U.S.-grown flowers promotes a culture that values flowers in general and a culture that is engaged with the flowers from seed to vase. The options to buy U.S.-grown flowers are growing. Slow Flowers, run by Debra Prinzing, is a nationwide online directory for florists to find U.S.-grown flowers. Pot and Box in Detroit uses the Slow Flowers network to connect with U.S. farms and the florist also showcases its floral arrangements in Detroit-made vases. In Chicago, Field and Florist is located in the Wicker Park neighborhood and also uses the Slow Flowers network to supply more than 40 Chicago-area florists with flowers. David Muir speaks with florist Emily Thompson in New York City. Thompson said recently that her shop supports US farmers and she's noticed that customers are starting to ask for local flowers as well. Thompson, a former artist who said her love for flowers had ""crept up"" on her, said she was now focused on not only supporting her beloved blooms, but also giving U.S. farmers a voice and connecting her clientele with the ""living world.""

AP Photo/Richard Vogel California is set to begin sales of recreational marijuana on January 1. The market is expected to hit $3.7 billion in 2018 alone, and that number will increase to over $5 billion in 2019. Legal marijuana will be a tax windfall for the state. Recreational cannabis sales are set to begin in California on January 1 — and the market is expected to haul in billions in revenue next year as dispensaries roll out across the state. A report from the cannabis industry research firm BDS Analytics estimates sales of cannabis to hit $3.7 billion in 2018 alone, and predict that number will increase to $5.1 billion in 2019 as more dispensaries come online. For comparison, beer sales in California hit $5 billion in 2017, according to industry research group IBIS World. California — the world's sixth largest economy with a population of close to 40 million — will be a huge chunk of the total market for cannabis in North America. Legal marijuana sales are predicted to hit $9.7 billion across the seven states where recreational marijuana is legal, excluding California, and Canada in 2017 alone, according to BDS. That number is expected to hit $24.5 billion in sales by 2021, despite continued federal prohibition. But many Californians in some of the state's largest cities will have to wait to buy legal pot. Many cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco, haven't yet passed regulations in time for the January 1 date, reports Green State, a cannabis-focused digital outlet. That means that a number of medical dispensaries, who are trying to transition to the adult-use, or recreational market, will not have their licenses in place to open on New Year's Day. On top of that, the price of pot is expected to increase up to 15% as California applies a new excise tax on recreational sales. According to Green State, the price of an eighth-ounce of marijuana — now around $54 including tax — will increase to approximately $65, though local municipalities may levy different fees. While it's hard to say how this will affect the market, there is a concern here among some industry analysts that high prices may divert some customers to the black market, where they an avoid the extra fees. "" If there are only 10 regulated dispensaries in the East Bay and I live 45 minutes from one of them, I’m going to call my dealer or my unregulated delivery service like I’ve done for the last five years,"" Hezekiah Allen, the executive director of the California Growers Association, told Bloomberg. ""What we need to do in California right now is ensure that every Californian that wants to consume cannabis can buy it at an affordable price, conveniently, from a licensed retailer,"" Allen added. All that extra tax, however, will likely be a windfall for California. By 2021, BDS Analytics predicts California will rake in up to $1.4 billion from taxes on recreational marijuana purchases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70,The town that became Scotland's chilli capital,It all began as a joke but now Mark Hodgson can't even pop to the shops without having to discuss chillies.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-45562914,2018-09-22T00:05:54Z,"Image copyright Langholm Chilli Club It all began as a joke but now Mark Hodgson can't even pop to the shops without having to discuss chillies with people in the street. The small southerly town of Langholm is laying claim to the title ""chilli capital of Scotland"" and Mark is the man responsible. It was his love of the fiery fruit that has led to hundreds of homes growing chillies and a reputation that has spread around the world. Mark grew his first chillies as a student in the 1990s, after he was given a plant by his favourite Bangladeshi takeaway. Image copyright Langholm Chilli Club Image caption The first Thai Green chillies of the season He has grown them almost every year since but last year, after planting his seeds, he had to go to the US for a couple of months. Before leaving Langholm for the US, he handed his seedlings to ""anyone who would take them,"" rather than see them die in his absence. One elderly friend took the plants off his hands but then, as a rather cruel joke, told Mark he had managed to kill them all. Image caption More than 1,000 chilli plants are growing in homes, businesses and schools in Langholm The same friend later surprised him by walking into their favourite cafe with a large bag of fresh chillies, the harvest from Mark's plants. The incident piqued the interest of other people in the cafe and the Langholm Chilli Club was formed. The club arranged a meeting in the cafe and expected to host a handful of people but word got around the town and it went ""far out of control"", says Mark. ""From this point last year, guessing we might have 20 people, now we've got hundreds,"" he says. ""It's gone a little bit further than expected."" The hot topic in Langholm Mark hoped that the new club would help brighten up the town with colourful plants ""when everything is going grey and dark"". He wasn't prepared for the reaction he received from friends and neighbours, as the craze for chillies spread far beyond Langholm's boundaries. The club now has members in the US, Canada and Portugal and a waiting list of 60 people eager to nurture their own plants next year. ""You've no idea how many conversations I've had with people saying 'I gave one to my grandma', 'She gave one to her son in Fife',"" Mark says. ""Then all of a sudden they're in Canada. It's just ridiculous."" Image caption Katherine Latimer said her chilli plant in the window of Latimer's of Langholm had become ""a bit of an obsession"" Less than a year since the group began, Mark reckons that chilli plants are now growing in at least 300 of Langholm's 900 homes. Many of them began as seeds which were sourced and distributed by the chilli club. But the committee also handed out seedlings which were germinated in heated propagators - Mark himself nurtured 331 plants in his tiny one-bedroom flat. Now he believes there are more than 1,000 chilli plants, and in excess of 70 varieties, in conservatories, greenhouses and on window sills across Langholm. Image copyright Mark Hodgson Image caption Mark says he grew more than 300 chilli plant seedlings in his one bedroom flat There's a ""Chilli Trail"" through the town where visitors can view 23 plants in shop windows and community buildings. And on Saturday, Langholm Agricultural Show will host the inaugural ""ChilliFest"", which will culminate in the inevitable chilli eating contest. Fifteen of the town's bravest souls will work their way through a succession of chillies, from the Apple Crisp - so mild it can be eaten like its fruity namesake - to the ""brutal"" Carolina Reaper, named by Guinness World Records as the world's most fiery chilli. (We've been assured medical assistance will be on standby). Heating up Langholm's tourism industry The history of Langholm is interwoven with its textile industry but this year its largest employer is preparing to pull out of the town. Edinburgh Woollen Mill, which employs 190 staff at its Langholm headquarters, is relocating across the border, to Carlisle, 20 miles away. Image caption Billy Young says his Orange Habarnero is ""like a triffid"" in the window of The Paper Shop Billy Young, the chairman of Langholm's regeneration group, says the decision will affect footfall on the high street. ""Twenty or 30 years ago, we had six very big mills and we had Border Fine Arts which made the handcrafted figurines and Edinburgh Woollen Mill,"" he says. ""Come Christmas, we're going to have nothing at all. ""It's a very, very strong community. It will weather this storm, I'm sure."" He says it was time for Langholm to rebrand itself and make itself more attractive as a visitor destination. So could the town claim to be Scotland's Chilli Capital? Mark Hodgson thinks so. Image caption Laura Ellis, who is growing a Carolina Reaper in the Blue Moon cafe, says the town has gone ""chilli mad"" ""We're comfortable that we've taken the title on that,"" he says. ""Partly because nobody else has done it - I know, I've checked."" As economic challenges loom, cafe owner Laura Ellis, said the chilli club had brought some much-needed excitement and fun to the town. ""We're all chilli-mad at the minute,"" she says. Cooking up a storm As the chillies ripen, Langholm's more adventurous cooks are finding new and inventive ways of using them to feed their families. Recipes are being shared on social media while chilli jams, powders and dipping sauces are being distributed to friends and neighbours. For some of Langholm's chilli growers and their families however, this is their first experience of spicy food. ""Some of them thought gammon and pineapple was exotic,"" Mark says. Image copyright Langholm Chilli Club 'We'll swamp the entire town with chilli' Mark's infectious enthusiasm has drawn both experienced horticulturalists and first-time growers to chilli club. The project has even been picked up by two local schools, where it is being used to educate children about how things grow. ""That's one of the most beautiful aspects of it,"" he said. ""My dream would be if just one of those kids ends up being a biologist, just maybe, because of it, that whole thing would have been worthwhile."" Image caption ""It's put Langholm on the map"", says Bill Barbour, who is growing a plant in his electrical store (Fairy lights, model's own) Next year he has big plans to make sure everyone in the local area has an opportunity to grow a chilli plant. He wants to establish a more substantial, standalone chilli festival and there are even rumours of a community business. It sounds ambitious but it's clear he has the backing of the community.

In his open-air workshop, high on the eastern hills of a slum neighbourhood of Cairo, the father-of-four says with a sigh: “Life is a lot more difficult than it used to be.” For more than a decade, he’s kept food on the family dinner table by collecting and selling old bits of copper, but in the past couple of years, the prices of food, fuel and rent, have soared, while his income has stayed roughly the same. He’s one of many Egyptians who now find themselves teetering on the brink of poverty. Massive inflation and a sharp drop in tourism since the 2011 revolution have ushered in a period of austerity in Egypt. Encouraged by the International Monetary Fund, President Abdel Fateh el Sisi’s administration has cut the subsidies for food and fuel that many Egyptians depend on. In 2016, Egypt’s central bank unpegged the Egyptian pound from the dollar, which plummeted overnight to less than half its previous value, resulting in surging costs of imports on which the country relies. While the number of those living in poverty on the continent has declined since 1990 – and global rates of poverty have more than halved – Unicef reported last December that since 2000 the number of Egyptians living in poverty has nearly doubled. Egypt has been on the economic rocks ever since the Arab Spring revolution. The instability that followed the protests that brought down the President of 30 years, Hosni Mubarak, frightened away foreign business, not to mention tourists, which once brought a steady flow of foreign currency into the country. Arguably necessary to manage the crisis, the policies of the current President have done little to improve the lives of everyday Egyptians. Under Sisi, the country has been subjected to four years of austerity, while simultaneously pouring money into dubious mega-projects, such as the expansion of the Suez Canal, and the creation of a new capital city way out in the rocky desert east of Cairo. As a result, poor Egyptians such as Eid are further tightening their belts. Originally from the countryside, Eid’s made a second home in Al Doweqa, an area within the slum settlement of Manshiyat Naser, a sprawling 5sq-km district of informally built red-brick tower blocks. With well over a quarter of a million inhabitants, the area has become synonymous with the struggles of Egypt’s urban poor. Built on and below a treacherous cliff edge, many of Al Doweqa’s tumbledown dwellings are inadequately built, and collapses are commonplace. As Eid hauls copper pipes into an open-back truck to take away to sell, just up the road, his neighbour, 43-year-old Afar Hussein Ahmed, watches as her two sons clear away the bricks that used to be her home. “I was just at my work in the marketplace,” she says, “and when I came back, my house was gone.” The brick shack with tarpaulin roof, which less than a day ago she called home, was just a room with a bed, a small area for preparing food, and a couple of boxes for her clothes. Her voice cracking, she casts a hand over the rubble burying the bed she rose from just hours before the collapse. “God knows where I’ll sleep tonight,” she says. Such stories are common in this community. The slum gained national notoriety back in 2008 when a rockslide took out the main street, killing more than 100 people. Since then a government-sponsored rehousing scheme has begun relocating residents to a purpose built compound a few miles away. Ahmed and her neighbours wait and pray for their turn. For most of them, it’s their only way off the cliff edge. They live hand to mouth as it is, she says, and, with the current cost of living so high, there’s no way widows like her can possibly save up the money to move. The increase of prices across the country has meant that Egyptians who were once just about getting by are now slipping deeper into poverty. A local charity, the Egyptian Food Bank, says they’ve seen a massive upsurge in people now in need of their help to feed their families. “The price of almost everything has increased, surpassing people’s income,” says Moez el Shohdi, chief executive of the charity. “The number of people who come to us increases every year.” The charity says it currently helps around 450,000 families keep food on the table, all through private donations, but their resources are now having to be spread between the growing number of those in need. The government also offers some support. In addition to the rehousing scheme for Al Doweqa residents, the takaful (solidarity) and karama (dignity) programmes offer direct monetary assistance to Egypt’s poorest. Eid, for example, receives an extra 600 pounds a month to help support his family. But it’s in rural communities, like in Eid’s native village near the Fayoum oasis, where poverty is highest, and where government assistance is harder to come by. According to Hala Abu Khatwa of Unicef, four out of five “multidimensionally poor children” in Egypt live in the countryside. Despite his meagre pay, Eid’s copper enterprise is just enough to keep his family afloat. Outside the country’s urban centres, however, such opportunities are thin on the ground. In the village of Al Basqalon in Minya, Upper Egypt, the countries economic woes are more keenly felt. A 2013 study puts the number of “chronically poor” people in Upper Egypt at 30 per cent, and the Minya governorate has around a third of the country’s poorest villages. Al Basqalon isn’t one of them. It’s a fairly typical village of 5,000 people with a high school, a newly opened football pitch, and a small hospital open 10 hours a day. The land is green here, and the air is fresh, 165 miles south of the Cairo smog that sticks in the sinuses of the capital’s 20 million inhabitants. There’s no air pollution in Al Basqalon; nothing to indicate any sort of industry at all. Like the other villages that surround it, it depends entirely on farming, aside from which, there’s no work. “There are no opportunities here,” says Ragb Abdel Halim, the manager of a local charity that provides support to Al Basqalon’s poorest residents. “There’s nothing at all. Most of the men end up going to Saudi Arabia for work.” Throughout the tiny village, old women sit on doorsteps gossiping, while children play in the unpaved streets. There are few young men here. Nearly all have left to find work elsewhere in Cairo or abroad in the Gulf states. One man in his twenties has just sent back word that he’s made it to the UK, after risking his life sneaking into Libya, crossing the Mediterranean in a rickety boat, and finally smuggling himself into a lorry bound for England. For those left in the village, there’s nothing but sporadic farm work, labouring for big landowners for as little as 50 pounds (£2) a day. One such worker is Ibrahim Syed Ahmed, who, at 70, is too old to jump ship for Saudi Arabia. He shares a run-down two-room shack with his wife and 14-year-old son. He should be retired, he says, “but what can I do?” These days, he says, even this low-paid field work is hard to come by. In the past few years, landowners have had to cut back on labour costs, leaving occasional workers like Ahmed competing for positions and his wife forced to chip in, cleaning and washing clothes for as little as 20 pounds (80p) a day. To subsidise their living, they receive help from the government, although he gives sardonic smile when he says how much: 40 pounds (£1.60) a month. Even those who own land might struggle to make ends meet. Mohamed Reyb, a stocky 40-year-old farmer, used to make a decent living growing cotton. Egyptian cotton has long enjoyed a luxury status around the world, and once provided farmers like Reyb with a steady income. But with increased competition from US farmers, and a decision by the Sisi administration to cut subsidies for growers in 2015, many have abandoned cotton altogether. “You can’t make a profit anymore,” says Rejb, looking out over his land, which he now uses to grow onions. In addition to rising prices for fuel and fertiliser, Rejb also faces a dwindling of his primary resource: water. Relying almost exclusively on the Nile for its supply, this single resource is being stretched to the maximum to secure the water needs of an ever-growing population. At the start of the millennium, Egypt’s population numbered 70 million. In just 17 years, it’s risen to around 100 million, and is estimated to hit 120 million by 2030. Since 2015, the country has officially been in a state of water poverty. For Rejb, what was once a bountiful resource has become a tenuous commodity. Some days, he says, his supply is cut off completely. “If I can’t get water then my crops will die,” he says. He points to cluster of red-brick buildings off in the distance. “See those houses?” he says. “That all used to be farmland. Since there’s no longer any money in farming, farmers have started selling off their land.” Around 30,000 acres of farmland are lost each year to largely illegally built settlements. As more of the land that was once the breadbasket of the Roman empire disappears under bricks and mortar, the country is forced to import more of its food from abroad, putting yet more strain on the economy. Despite a laundry list of economic woes, Sisi will seek re-election as President next month with seemingly no chance of losing. All credible opposition has been swept aside; some have ended up in jail. His only opponent, Moussa Mostafa Moussa, is a textbook patsy. After appearing out of total obscurity this month to announce his candidacy, people on social media began sharing screenshots of his Facebook account, which was inundated with photos of his supposed rival and incumbent President. Many Egyptians are refusing to call it an election, opting instead to label it a “referendum” with only one possible outcome. Yet the President retains real support, surprisingly, even among those struggling to survive in the current climate. Eid, the copper worker from Cairo, is one of those who still has faith in the administration. “Things have got more difficult since the revolution, and under the current President, but I still agree with what the government is doing,” he says. “It’s like if you have a factory destroyed, it takes time to rebuild it. But when it’s all finished, then you can get back to work.” Reuse content",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both contests will be a test for Notley, whose governing NDP hasn't won a byelection since it came to power in 2015. Both constituencies were previously held by UCP MLAs and are conservative strongholds. The Alberta NDP and United Conservative Party have had their candidates in place for about a month. The Alberta Party has a candidate in Innisfail-Sylvan Lake and intends to have someone in the race for Fort McMurray-Conklin. The Alberta Liberals plan to have names on the ballot in both byelections. Randy Thorsteinson, leader of the Reform Party of Alberta, is running in Innisfail-Sylvan Lake. Fort McMurray-Conklin The constituency has been without an MLA since March 5 when former Wildrose Leader Brian Jean resigned. Fort McMurray has almost consistently elected Social Credit, Progressive Conservative or Wildrose MLAs over the last 50 years, with only one exception. Liberal Adam Germain held the Fort McMurray seat for four years until he was unseated by Progressive Conservative Guy Boutilier in 1997. Although the riding is a conservative stronghold, the NDP has great hopes for its candidate Jane Stroud, a councillor for the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo. Laila Goodridge, UCP Laila Goodridge, 30, beat three other candidates, including Wood Buffalo Coun. Phil Meagher, in a hotly contested battle for the UCP nomination. Goodridge was a constituency assistant for former Calgary Conservative MP Joan Crockatt. She also worked as a disaster recovery specialist for Jean and Fort McMurray-Wood Buffalo MLA Tany Yao. Goodridge also spent five years working for Syncrude and North American Construction. Her most recent employment was in Edmonton as a legislative outreach assistant for the Wildrose and UCP. Goodridge was born and raised in Fort McMurray and is fluent in French. She has a degree in political science from the University of Alberta. Jane Stroud, NDP Jane Stroud, 70, is in her third term as a councillor for the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, representing Anzac, Conklin, Janvier and Gregoire Lake Estates. She has lived in Anzac her whole life. Prior to her election to council in 2010, she worked in accounts for the Métis local in Fort McMurray. Stroud was named the NDP candidate in Fort McMurray-Conklin in May. Brian Deheer, Green Party Brian Deheer, 57, has been a member of the Green Party of Canada since 2009. He ran for the party in Lac La Biche-St. Paul-Two Hills in the 2015 provincial election. He finished fourth, behind the Wildrose, NDP and Progressive Conservative candidates. Deheer is a music instructor who has lived in Lac La Biche since 1992. He has also lived in Calgary and St. Paul. Innisfail-Sylvan Lake Four candidates are officially in the race to fill the seat vacated by former UCP MLA Don MacIntyre on Feb. 5. MacIntyre resigned after he was charged with sexual assault and sexual interference. The Alberta Liberals intend to run a candidate but have yet to announce a name. The constituency has been represented by a Progressive Conservative or Wildrose MLA since it was created in 1993. Devin Dreeshen, UCP Devin Dreeshen, 30, was policy adviser to former federal Conservative agriculture minister Gerry Ritz. Dreeshen has a consulting business which focuses on trade issues affecting agriculture. He farms near Pine Lake and is a director of the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association. He is the son of Red Deer-Mountain View Conservative MP Earl Dreeshen. Dreeshen faced five other candidates in his successful nomination bin. Nicole Mooney, NDP Nicole Mooney, 36, teaches English at St. Joseph High School in Red Deer. She is also the communications officer for the Red Deer Catholic Local 80 of the Alberta Teachers' Association. Mooney has lived in Sylvan Lake for 12 years.

73,Cramer: Legalization is bad for marijuana pricing—pot stocks look expensive,Jim Cramer looks at the blazing bull market in marijuana to see if the stocks are good buys or about to go up in smoke.,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/20/cramer-legalization-is-bad-for-marijuana-prices-pot-stocks-are-costly.html,2018-04-20T22:33:00Z,"In honor of 4/20, the unofficial marijuana holiday that falls on April 20, CNBC's Jim Cramer took a look at the state of the red-hot bull market in marijuana. div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child""&gt; ""[It's] the hottest sector of the economy that remains totally illegal according to the federal government,"" the "" Mad Money "" host said on Friday. So far, 29 U.S. states and Washington, D.C. have legalized medical marijuana, and nine states and D.C. have legalized recreational marijuana. As related businesses in those states flourish, they have also created new ways to invest in the marijuana industry. ""So while I may not be a cannabis connoisseur... and I don't know the best way to tell you to get baked, I can absolutely help you figure out how to play the booming bud industry,"" Cramer said. But even as marijuana investing grows in popularity — research firm Cowen estimates that the U.S. cannabis market could be worth $75 billion by 2030 — Cramer wasn't sold on the trend. ""The issue is that there's been a huge, cryptocurrency-like run in this group and it's making most of these stocks too expensive for my taste,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. Even so, Cramer acknowledged the legitimacy of the marijuana business. Numerous studies have touted the benefits of medicinal marijuana, and the Food and Drug Administration will soon weigh the approval of the first cannabis-derived drug on the U.S. market. Lawmakers are also turning positive on the plant. On Thursday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a plan to decriminalize marijuana on the federal level. Last week, former Speaker of the House John Boehner announced he would join the advisory board of privately-held marijuana company Acreage Holdings, telling CNBC in a statement that his ""thinking on cannabis has evolved."" ""Of course, the Trump administration has very different views, especially our very old-school Attorney General [ Jeff Sessions ],"" Cramer said. ""Sessions is not a fan of the marijuana industry and that makes investing in these stocks inherently more risky than investing in something that's less legally murky."" At this point, most marijuana companies are based in Canada, where medical marijuana is federally legal and recreational legalization is on its way. But most of their stocks trade ""over the counter,"" which Cramer said makes them illiquid, highly volatile and too risky for him to recommend. He pointed to three Canadian marijuana growers: Aurora Cannabis Company, Canopy Growth Corp. and Aphria. With the rise of marijuana-themed exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, all of their stocks have soared to ""extreme"" valuations, Cramer said. Experts estimate that the Canadian market could be worth $9 billion in several years. But Aurora, Canopy and Aphria are currently worth $3.8 billion, $4.7 billion and $1.85 billion, respectively, all ""very optimistic"" valuations considering the research at hand, Cramer said. ""Here's the thing: legalization is horrible for pot pricing,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""When states legalize, prices fall through the floor. I mean, it's a plant, for heaven's sake. The fact that it's against the law is the only thing that makes it expensive, so if you're betting on the state of the industry several years down the line, you really should bake that into your numbers."" Cramer wasn't even sure about the seemingly stable Cronos Group, a diversified international cannabis producer with the first pot stock to be listed on a major U.S. exchange. ""It's too risky for me to recommend to you,"" he said, noting that the company only generated less than $5 million in revenue in 2017 but its stock is currently valued at $1.3 billion. For investors seeking some green, Cramer recommended the stocks of British drug company GW Pharmaceuticals, which develops cannabis-derived medications, and Constellation Brands, an alcohol company with a nearly 10 percent stake in Canopy Growth. ""The bottom line? When you're dealing with a controlled substance, you always need to play it safe,"" Cramer concluded. ""So when it comes to investing in the marijuana stocks, most of them are way too dank for me. They're downright bubblicious, which is why only GW Pharma and Constellation Brands have my blessing because I don't want your money to go up in smoke.""

74,Skyrocketing cost of vanilla 'really tough' for Halifax food industry,"Severe weather, along with greed and the black market, has caused the price of vanilla to increase 500 per cent in the past year. That's causing hardship for Halifax's food industry.",http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/vanilla-prices-halifax-cake-shop-cost-1.4592165,2018-03-25T16:00:58Z,"It's one of the world's favourite flavours and it's becoming one of the most costly. Jennifer Harrison, owner of Layers Cakes, uses Nielsen Massey pure vanilla extract and paste in just about all of her recipes. Like many bakers, ice-cream makers and grocery store owners, she started noticing a sharp increase in cost about a year ago. ""It didn't just creep, like it went drastically up. It was from one order to the next,"" said Harrison. A one-litre bottle of vanilla paste that cost about $30 rose to $80, then $125 and it's now hovering around $160, she said. That 500-per-cent jump was one of the reasons Harrison recently increased her prices for the first time since opening her shop five years ago. ""Bakery margins, they're tight so then when you go and do an increase like that, it's really tough,"" she said. The high cost of vanilla is being blamed on short supply. Last spring, cyclone Enawo tore through Madagascar, where about 80 per cent of the world's vanilla is grown. ""What producers and suppliers had said was, 'You know what, it was a bad crop. It should improve.' Well, it hasn't improved yet. I don't know if it will, but we haven't seen any decrease,"" Harrison said. Layers Cakes uses vanilla in its vanilla buttercream cupcakes and just about every other recipe, says owner Jennifer Harrison. (Submitted by Jennifer Harrison) But ask a former spice merchant in Halifax, and he'll tell you how greed, corruption and the black market are exacerbating the frenzy over one of the world's favourite flavours. ""There's vicious cycles within vicious cycles,"" said Costas Halavrezos, who, until recently, was The Spiceman. ""When something gets as overheated as this, there's another problem for the traditional, artisanal growers and curers of vanilla and that is theft."" It takes patience to grow vanilla, he said. In fact, it's a months-long process to turn the immature, green vanilla pods into the dark-brown beans that end up in cakes, soaps and drinks. For a long time, the spice was largely grown by small-scale producers in a few select areas of the world, but more people want in on the action and are producing lower-quality vanilla that's hurting the industry, said Halavrezos. Halavrezos said he often sold vanilla pods at the market to people interested in making their own extract. One supplier in the vanilla industry has predicted sky-high prices could collapse soon. (Suto Norbert Zsolt/Shutterstock) ""If I was still in business today, I wouldn't be able to sell it because I don't think people would buy the vanilla beans at the price I would have to sell them at,"" he said. According to one of the world's largest vanilla suppliers, Aust &amp; Hachmann, the industry is in full-on crisis. But while it's hard to predict, the company says prices could soon collapse. In the meantime, Halavrezos expects more and more consumers and business owners to turn to the cheaper alternative: artificial vanilla extract. But Harrison said even if it means absorbing further price hikes, she's not giving up on the good stuff. ""When you're dealing with pastry and cakes, I mean, pure vanilla extract, there's no substitute,"" she said. ""So it's not as though there's another option for a lower price point. There was no question that we were just going to have to ride the storm.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,Why companies are eyeing the cannabis compound that doesn't get you high,"Cannabidiol, or CBD, a compound derived from cannabis that doesn't get people stoned, is being eyed by companies of all stripes including beverage giant Coca-Cola. Regulations and attitudes are warming up to it and the potential for CBD-infused products to be…",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cannabis-compound-cbd-1.4840772,2018-09-27T15:31:22Z,"It's being touted as the next new miracle ingredient for everything from pet treats to anti-aging face creams and elixirs that can help an athlete's aching body recover faster. But that's not the only reason that cannabidiol or CBD, a compound derived from cannabis that doesn't get people stoned, is being eyed by companies of all stripes including beverage giant Coca-Cola. Regulations and attitudes are warming up to it and the potential for CBD-infused products to be available on grocery or pharmacy shelves instead of in tightly-regulated pot shops in the not-so-distant future. That includes store shelves in Canada down the road, says Trina Fraser, an Ottawa-based lawyer who advises the cannabis industry. Globally, the market for CBD could be ""massive,"" she said. ""Think about cosmetics, and skin creams, and arthritic topical creams, and all sorts of types of products that you would go to a drug store to buy that could have these potentially therapeutic effects from CBD That's certainly not unrealistic, and I think in fact, odds are, we will be there [in Canada]. I hope, within the next five years."" CBD is a compound found in cannabis and hemp heralded for its therapeutic effects, but does not produce a narcotic effect. Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is the psychoactive compound that gives users a high. Research evidence, as for cannabis overall, is slim but the anecdotal buzz about CBD is building. Regulations could ease soon ""The body of research around it is still catching up, it's still in progress, but that word of mouth is really what's driving it,"" said Bethany Gomez, a legal cannabis and CBD industry researcher with Brightfield Group. Products with CBD in Canada are illegal unless authorized for medical purposes, according to Health Canada. When Canada legalizes pot for recreational use on Oct. 17, products with CBD will be regulated similarly to marijuana products. But restrictions on CBD are showing signs of easing, particularly in the U.S., and the growth projections for the market are now dramatically higher than they were a year ago, Brightfield says. It could outpace the rest of the cannabis market to reach $22 billion US by 2022, according to its recent report. Hemp and cannabis are Schedule 1 federally controlled substances in the U.S. CBD is legal in all 50 states, but only if derived from industrial hemp cultivated for academic research or agricultural pilot programs. However, if the 2018 Farm Bill working its way through the U.S. legislative process passes, it would allow for the full legalization of industrial hemp in the United States, allowing CBD to be sold across state lines. ""This legal grey area that plagues the market right now, that essentially is wiped out It allows it to be on the shelves of Krogers and Target and Walmart,"" Gomez said. Could help control seizures World Health Organization experts said last year that CBD in its pure state ""does not appear to have abuse potential or cause harm"" and it should not be internationally scheduled as a controlled substance. WHO added that initial studies show that CBD could have some therapeutic value for seizures due to epilepsy and related conditions. Some athletes now have the green light to use CBD. The World Anti-Doping Agency last year said CBD products would be OK for use, provided it does not have any THC, which remains banned. In June, 3-on-3 basketball league BIG3 said its players would be allowed to use CBD for pain management and recovery, believed to be the first professional sports league in the U.S. to do so. Change is afoot at home, too. Health Canada put forward an exemption last month for industrial hemp farmers with the proper licenses to harvest and store the whole plant including the flower, where CBD is found, not just the stalk and seeds which produce little amounts of the cannabinoid. The farmers will be able to sell it to a licensed processor for sale under the Cannabis act. Prior to this, hemp growers had to destroy the other parts of the plant. Health Canada exploring use As well, Health Canada has spoken about potentially allowing for natural health products to contain cannabis and cannabinoids, including CBD. Natural health products (NHP) in Canada must be safe to use as over-the-counter products and do not need a prescription to be sold. There are 220 NHP with cannabis currently authorized for sale, according to Health Canada. These are authorized because they use only the stalk and non-viable seeds, as allowed under current legislation, which produce no meaningful CBD, if any, Fraser said. The proposal in Health Canada's November 2017 consultation paper would allow the flowering heads of the plant to be used in NHPs, she added. Health Canada concluded in June that more consultation is still needed. Beverage, alcohol companies exploring options Still, this hasn't stopped companies in Canada from offering products such as spa treatments infused with CBD, which are either breaking the law or don't contain a large enough amount of CBD to have an effect, Fraser said. Meanwhile, alcohol companies and consumer packaged goods companies are taking a closer look too. Our belief is it will be not only as big as cannabis, but far, far greater -David Rendimonti, LiveWell president The latest company to express interest in CBD is beverages giant Coca-Cola, which BNNBloomberg reported was in ""serious talks"" with Canadian marijuana producer Aurora Cannabis. Coca-Cola said it had no interest in marijuana or cannabis but ""along with many others in the beverage industry, we are closely watching the growth of non-psychoactive CBD as an ingredient in functional wellness beverages around the world."" Meanwhile, Canopy Growth is embarking on a Health Canada-approved clinical trial to research the use of CBD to treat animal anxiety. Canopy Growth's venture capital arm Canopy Rivers also has an investment in LiveWell Canada, which is researching CBD and other cannabinoids and plans to develop CBD products.

76,California's cannabis market is expected to soar to $5.1 billion -- and it's going to be bigger than beer,"California began the sale of recreational marijuana on January 1. The market is expected to hit $US3.7 billion by the end 2018, and that number will increase to over $US5 billion in 2019. More »",https://www.businessinsider.com/california-legalizing-weed-on-january-1-market-size-revenue-2017-12,2018-02-28T05:30:00Z,"California began the sale of recreational marijuana on January 1. The market is expected to hit $US3.7 billion by the end 2018, and that number will increase to over $US5 billion in 2019. Legal marijuana will be a tax windfall for the state. Recreational cannabis sales began in California on January 1 – and the market is expected to haul in billions in revenue next year as dispensaries roll out across the state. A report from the cannabis industry research firm BDS Analytics estimates sales of cannabis to hit $US3.7 billion by the end of 2018 alone, and predict that number will increase to $US5.1 billion in 2019 as more dispensaries come online. For comparison, beer sales in California hit $US5 billion in 2017, according to industry research group IBIS World. California – the world’s sixth largest economy with a population of close to 40 million – will be a huge chunk of the total market for cannabis in North America. Legal marijuana sales hit $US9.7 billion across the seven states where recreational marijuana is legal, excluding California, and Canada in 2017 alone, according to BDS. That number is expected to hit $US24.5 billion in sales by 2021, despite continued federal prohibition. On top of that, the price of pot is expected to increase up to 15% as California applies a new excise tax on recreational sales. According to Green State, the price of an eighth-ounce of marijuana – now around $US54 including tax – is approximately $US65, though local municipalities may levy different fees. While it’s hard to say how this will affect the market, there is a concern here among some industry analysts that high prices may divert some customers to the black market, where they an avoid the extra fees. “If there are only 10 regulated dispensaries in the East Bay and I live 45 minutes from one of them, I’m going to call my dealer or my unregulated delivery service like I’ve done for the last five years,” Hezekiah Allen, the executive director of the California Growers Association, told Bloomberg. “What we need to do in California right now is ensure that every Californian that wants to consume cannabis can buy it at an affordable price, conveniently, from a licensed retailer,” Allen added. All that extra tax, however, will likely be a windfall for California. By 2021, BDS Analytics predicts California will rake in up to $US1.4 billion from taxes on recreational marijuana purchases.

To bring in the new year, the state had become the latest in the US to legalise the drug for recreational use, following years of partial legalisation for medical purposes. Even before full legalisation kicked in, California was already the cannabis capital of the US. “California produces the majority of the marijuana that the US consumes, legal or illegal,” said Dr Mourad Gabriel, an ecologist at the University of California, Davis. While this status has made California popular among cannabis enthusiasts for decades, it has been accompanied by a creeping environmental disaster. Hidden in California’s extensive forests are thousands of illegal cannabis farms. At these sites the desire to maximise production and profit and the need to grow in discrete areas that are far from ideal for agriculture, has driven growers to extreme measures. The lack of oversight means many of these sites are doused in toxic chemicals that are working their way into the ecosystem and poisoning California’s wildlife. “Overuse of pesticides is just absolutely rampant,” said Dr Gabriel. As many cannabis growers are already operating outside of the law, they do not feel compelled to stick to state regulations concerning chemicals and excessive use is not the only concern. On illegal farms run by cartels, scientists have found traces of fertilisers and pesticides like carbofuran that have been banned in the US for years. In pictures: 4/20 Marijuana world rallies In their work, Dr Gabriel and his colleagues have found endangered owls and weasel-like mammals called fishers showing signs of poisoning by rodenticides. These chemicals are applied to prevent rats from eating sugar-rich cannabis sprouts and when ingested they cause brain damage and internal bleeding. Besides working their way up the food chain and poisoning animals, toxic chemicals are seeping into the water supply. Here they have the potential to harm more wildlife, as well as livestock and people. But as the cannabis industry seeks legitimacy, a chance presents itself for a crackdown on the illegal chemicals that currently prop up much of California’s cannabis production and a move towards a greener solution. “I talk to a lot of growers who are permitted or who want to come into regulatory oversight and some of them are seeking organic status, they want to be sustainable,” said Dr Gabriel. With legalisation, economics and market pressure could ultimately “weed out the majority” of black market cannabis production, according to Dr Gabriel. This would pave the way for a state-wide cannabis industry that complies with chemical regulations. However, the dissipation of the black market will “not take place overnight”. Dr Reggie Gaudino is chief science officer at Steep Hill Labs, a medical cannabis research facility that aims to “empower cultivators, dispensaries, manufacturers and consumers with a transparent understanding of science”. He says regulation of the industry, along with proper enforcement and education on alternative pest management methods, could result in an overall reduction in pesticide use. According to Dr Gaudino, there is growing awareness about the need to protect the environment while growing cannabis: “As the industry matures the community does become aware,” he explained. “There are several movements in the industry towards reducing the use of chemicals,” he said, mentioning the Clean Green growing programme, which allows growers to brand their product as grown without pesticides while still passing microbial testing. However, some in the state are a little less optimistic about the future of California’s environment. Stephen Frick, assistant special agent in charge of the Forest Service, thinks the legalisation of cannabis can only be bad news for the state’s wildlife. “I expect more people moving into the state for the sole purpose of marijuana production,” he said. “We will see more people and more marijuana production on both private and public lands.” Instead of purely green intentions, Mr Frick is concerned these new growers have another motivation: money. The issue, he said, is that the state lacks the capacity to deal with those who grow their cannabis using illegal chemicals. The stakes are just too high. Oregon is producing three times more marijuana than it can consume “Who is going to enforce the pesticide regulation in the state? What is the punishment for those caught with illegal pesticides?” Mr Frick asked. “The millions of dollars in illicit marijuana production here in California far outweigh any fines imposed by the state for using these illegal and/or legal pesticides in an unlawful manner. “Until California gets serious about making clean water and our environment a priority over legalising marijuana, pesticides will continue to be abused by growers regardless of the impact they have on our resources,” said Mr Frick. In the densely forested Humboldt county, on California’s north-west coast, a report released in November revealed there are around 15,000 grow sites. Of these, only 2,300 have applied for legal permits, of which only 91 were permitted. “So that demonstrates clearly that the majority of cultivators on private lands still want to be in the black market,” said Dr Gabriel. “Probably because of the high profit margin in the black market versus the regulated industry.” Dr Gabriel agrees there is a lack of capacity to deal with the illegal cannabis growers and their harmful chemicals. He estimates there are no more than 300 biologists and law enforcement agents hired to address the problem of illegal pesticide use by the state’s cannabis farmers. “That may seem like a lot of personnel, but we have upwards of 13,000 unpermitted grows that need to be inspected, enforced or eradicated in addition to the permitted grows that need inspecting in one county along,” he said. With 58 counties in California, that’s a lot of farms that require monitoring. “We can put regulations on the books, but it’s the question of how you enforce them, and how you standardise that enforcement,” said Dr Gabriel. Many have referred to the burgeoning cannabis economy as a “green rush”, an opportunity for motivated entrepreneurs to legitimise a previously illegal practice and bring in a huge amount of money in the process. However, Dr Gabriel warns that unless proper attention and respect are paid to the environment, the “green rush” analogy may be accurate in a less positive way. “When we look at it as conservationists, what we don’t want to happen is something similar to the gold rush,” he said. The gold rush brought enormous wealth to California, but also brought environmental devastation. Rivers were dammed, land was torn up and forests were logged to support the demand for the precious minerals. “We are still currently spending lots of public funded dollars to restore the ramifications from the gold rush that happened 150 years ago, said Dr Gabriel. “What I would hate to happen is that we bypass current environmental regulations for short term monetary gain.” Reuse content",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78,A marijuana startup is listing on a major US stock exchange for the first time — here's what you need to know,"Cronos Group will become the first marijuana company to trade on a major US stock exchange.

Chris Wattie/Reuters Cronos Group will become the first marijuana company to trade on a major US stock exchange. The company owns and operates businesses that are licensed to grow and sell weed in Canada, where medical marijuana is legal. The listing could signal to governments and investors that the legal marijuana industry has arrived, according to Cronos Group's CEO. Cronos Group, a Canadian company that's like Proctor &amp; Gamble for pot products, has received approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to begin trading on the Nasdaq. The Toronto-based company plans to list under the symbol ""CRON"" as early as February 26, Michael Gorenstein, CEO of Cronos Group, told Business Insider. The event marks a major milestone for the marijuana industry. Cronos Group will become the first company that grows and sells marijuana to list on a US stock exchange. American companies that process the plant have been sidelined because marijuana is still federally illegal. Cronos Group is not the first company affiliated with the marijuana industry to list on a US stock exchange, however. Most others are focused on ancillary products for pot growers — like fertilizer and lighting equipment — or biotech, developing drugs derived from marijuana. But Cronos Group is the first ""pure play cannabis company"" to list, according to Gorenstein. The company's listing could signal to governments, investors, and everyday Americans that the legal marijuana industry has arrived, according to Gorenstein. ""We are a legitimate company. This is a legitimate industry,"" Gorenstein said. Founded in 2013, Cronos Group — which already trades in Canada — owns and operates brands in the business of marijuana cultivation and distribution. It owns 100% of both Peace Naturals and Original BC, which are licensed to grow and sell medical marijuana. Cronos also has a minority stake in a third cannabis producer, Whistler Medical Marijuana Company. The company set out with the goal of changing the perception around marijuana. Cronos Group sells mostly flower (the green stuff you smoke) and oils derived from marijuana. They come in a variety of strengths and intended effects to suit customers' needs. Cronos has even patented some of its plant varieties. Gorenstein said when many people are asked to picture a marijuana company, they imagine ""some guy in their basement with a few lights on and pit bulls outside. We want to show that we treat cannabis like real medicine."" He added, ""We don't believe cannabis is a commodity."" Cronos Group is expanding its production facility in Ontario, Canada, in order to keep up with demand. Cronos Group Gorenstein said he began a relationship with Nasdaq last year. The company was approved for an over-the-counter listing — a type of security that trades on an exchange dedicated to small companies. When Gorenstein wanted to graduate to the Nasdaq, the company spent six months being audited and reviewed by different independent committees before filing an application. Gorenstein, who began his career as a corporate attorney at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, said he couldn't be sure if the Securities and Exchange Commission applied any more rigor in their review of Cronos compared to a company operating in another industry. Medical marijuana is fully legal in Canada, and the government will legalize recreational use this year. North Americans spent $9.2 billion on legal marijuana in 2017, and sales are expected to pass $47 billion in 2027, according to a report from Arcview Market Research. Sean Stiefel, cofounder of Navy Capital, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses solely on marijuana, said allowing Cronos Group to list is ""a logical decision by Nasdaq."" ""Cronos runs a legal business in their federal jurisdiction,"" Stiefel told Business Insider. He said it's no different than allowing offshore internet gambling companies to list on a US stock exchange, even though gaming exists in a legal gray area in the US. Cronos Group does not have any ties to the US marijuana industry, but Gorenstein said if federal prohibition in the country ended tomorrow, ""we would be there.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79,Senators recommend delaying cannabis bill for a year to address Indigenous issues,Members of the Senate's Aboriginal peoples committee are recommending the Liberal government hold back on legalizing cannabis for at least a year in order to address its potential for harmful effects in Indigenous communities.,http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/senate-cannabis-legislation-indigenous-1.4643590,2018-05-01T21:48:03Z,"Members of the Senate's Aboriginal peoples committee are recommending the Liberal government hold back on legalizing cannabis for at least a year in order to address its potential for harmful effects in Indigenous communities. The committee, chaired by Liberal Saskatchewan Sen. Lillian Dyck, said in its report on Bill C-45 that the government simply did not consult enough with First Nations, Inuit and Metis communities before pushing ahead with its plan to legalize the drug. ""Many communities are really worried about the potential adverse effects on their members, and especially on their youth, and it may be even worse because of the trauma in their communities,"" Dyck said, adding existing social issues in Indigenous communities could be made worse by increased drug use. If passed, the amendment would delay the bill's full implementation for up to a year. As currently written, the bill stipulates the law does not come into force until a date is fixed by an order of the governor-in-council — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's cabinet. A final vote on the bill is scheduled to occur in the Senate on or before June 7, with legalization expected to follow eight to 12 weeks later. The committee said the government should take that time to negotiate a revenue-sharing agreement with First Nations communities. The committee has heeded a request from Manny Jules, the chief commissioner of the First Nations Tax Commission, who recommended the federal government and the provinces hand cannabis taxing authority over to First Nations governments so they can impose their own levy on marijuana grown and sold on reserves. ""The way the bill has been crafted shows there was very little consultation,"" Conservative Alberta Sen. Scott Tannas told reporters. ""There was no thought given to the [tax issues], and there are First Nations that are keen on economic opportunities that would come from the legitimate production of cannabis and they feel that they're behind. There are Indigenous governments that want to see economic development and get revenue... None of that appears to have been considered."" First Nations say their governments will face new social challenges from legal cannabis, but they stand to gain nothing from Ottawa's plan. Under Jules' proposal, Ottawa and the provinces would cede ground to First Nations to collect taxes, providing a new source of much-needed revenue to their communities. The committee recommended an amendment to the legislation that would implement ""appropriate excise tax collection and sharing measures from revenue generated by cannabis produced on First Nations lands. ""The Department of Finance [should] immediately work with interested First Nations and First Nations institutions to allow them to collect cannabis excise tax revenues,"" the report said, calling for an amendment to the First Nations Fiscal Management Act to provide for a First Nation law-making power to levy cannabis excise taxes on reserve lands. The funds could then be used to develop cannabis-related laws and regulations on-reserve, fund campaigns to educate young people about the dangers of cannabis use and bolster First Nations police forces. The recommendation to extend taxation powers to First Nations will now be referred to the Senate's social affairs committee, which will make the ultimate decision on which amendments to the bill should get the green light. The whole Senate would have to vote on the amended bill, which — if approved — would go back to the House of Commons for a final vote. The Aboriginal peoples committee also found there is no ""culturally appropriate"" educational material ready to ensure Indigenous peoples understand the new law — which will legalize the drug, lead to the creation of provincially-run retail distribution systems and allow for home cultivation, among other sweeping changes to the country's drug laws. The committee heard from a number of witnesses who said the public education campaign that addresses the health effects of cannabis is woefully inadequate and is rolling out too close to the proposed legalization date — giving people too little time to learn about its harmful effects. It also noted a number of First Nations police witnesses raised the alarm about being unprepared for a wave of legal pot. In its report, the committee quoted Steve Burton of the Tssut'ina Nation Police Service, a reserve outside Calgary, who said his force doesn't have the tools it needs to enforce the act — which actually stiffens penalties for some offences, including giving cannabis to a minor — or to monitor drug-impaired driving. ""We don't have the people trained, the drug recognition experts. Those are training programs that require extensive time... For us to arrange that training when we're already low on manpower, we have to find a way to backfill that position or positions with other officers,"" he said. In an appearance before the Senate's social affairs committee earlier this week, the Canadian Real Estate Association encouraged the government to suspend provisions that will allow people to grow pot at home until there are better regulations in place to avoid property damage and sinking home prices. The Liberal government has said it plans to limit home marijuana growers to four plants per household. The government initially intended to limit plants to 100 centimetres in height, but the House of Commons approved an amendment that removed that restriction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aldi, Lidl, Iceland, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Waitrose recalled a variety of frozen veg products last week because they could contain the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, which can cause listeriosis. The recall followed a warning from the UK Food Standards Agency over products distributed by Greenyard Frozen, a Belgium-based supplier. In addition to the list of more than 40 items initially recalled, Lidl’s Green Grocers Carrots, Broccoli &amp; Sweetcorn, Baby Carrots, Peas, Green Beans &amp; Sweetcorn and Green Grocers Golden Vegetable Rice have been added to the list. The FSA warned that the product could be contaminated, and advised anyone who has purchased the item to return it to the store where it was bought for a full refund.

81,The Latest: Ohio won't make Sept. 8 medical marijuana date,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — The Latest on marijuana in Ohio (all times local):",https://apnews.com/32994ad87c98416f9ec2189fa6ffb863,2018-06-05T18:54:42Z,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — The Latest on marijuana in Ohio (all times local): 3 p.m. Ohio says medical marijuana won't be available for sale by the Sept. 8 deadline. Department of Commerce policy adviser Mark Hamlin said Tuesday that several cultivators have experienced inspection delays that make it impossible to have product on the shelves on the date set by Ohio's 2016 medical marijuana law. Hamlin said the state worked aggressively to meet the deadline and is disappointed on behalf of patients at the delay. He says the state is not technically out of compliance with the law. He said it called for having the program itself in place by Sept. 8. Hamlin couldn't say exactly when sales will begin, other than as soon as possible. Ohio has licensed 25 large and small growers and on Monday awarded 56 dispensary licenses. ——— 11:09 a.m. A key backer of recreational marijuana legalization in Ohio says he and his business partners are pursuing commercial, legislative and ballot strategies to continue expanding access to safe cannabis and related products. Ian James, founder and president of Green Light Acquisitions LLC, ran the unsuccessful ballot campaign to legalize both recreational and medical marijuana in 2015. Ohio has since legalized medical marijuana. James said Tuesday that his business has developed a line of therapeutic lotions, soaps and sprays using cannabidiol that he's marketing to large national retailers, including Urban Outfitters and Sephora. He's also pursuing another constitutional amendment legalizing marijuana for personal use that would likely appear on the 2020 ballot, while pushing bills to purge criminal records of former marijuana offenders and to open Ohio to legal hemp cultivation.

82,"Brexit: Farmers allowed to recruit 2,500 migrants a year under new government plan to plug seasonal workforce gap",Non-EU nationals who travel to UK to work on fruit and vegetable farms will be able to stay for six months,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-farmers-migrants-seasonal-workers-a8524871.html,2018-09-06T00:09:01Z,"British farmers will be allowed to recruit 2,500 non-EU migrants a year under a new government pilot that will help alleviate an anticipated shortage of seasonal workers after Brexit. The National Farmers Union has called for a special arrangement for short-term workers amid growing concerns over crops being left to rot on British farms because of a shortage of labour. Under the new scheme, which will run for two years from next spring, non-EU nationals who travel to the UK to work on fruit and vegetable farms will be able to stay for six months before returning. Industry bodies estimate the agriculture sector relies on a 75,000-strong temporary migrant workforce. Read more Unveiling the plans, Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""British farmers are vital to the UK's economy - and the government will look to support them in any way we can. ""This pilot will ensure farmers have access to the seasonal labour they need to remain productive and profitable during busy times of the year. ""I am committed to having an immigration system that reduces migration to sustainable levels, supports all industry and ensures we welcome those who benefit Britain."" Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the government has listened to the ""powerful arguments"" from farmers about the need for seasonal labour to keep the horticulture industry productive and profitable. He said: ""From lettuce in East Anglia to strawberries in Scotland, we want to make sure that farmers can continue to grow, sell and export more great British food. ""This two-year pilot will ease the workforce pressures faced by farmers during busy times of the year. ""We will review the pilot's results as we look at how best to support the longer-term needs of industry outside the EU."" The news was welcomed by Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers' Union, who described it as a ""major victory"". She said: ""It follows two years of evidence from the NFU, growers and MPs that a shortage of workers has been hampering food production, and is recognition from the Government that British horticulture is a successful, thriving sector which faces some unique challenges but is capable of producing more great, healthy British fruit and vegetables for people to eat. ""Farmers and growers have seen worker availability tighten significantly in recent years, with the shortfall so far this year reaching 10 per cent. ""Growers will take great confidence in knowing that they will have access to workers for the 2019 harvest, during what have been extremely testing and uncertain times for the sector.""

Under the last such programme in the UK, fruit and vegetable growers were allowed to employ migrant workers from Bulgaria and Romania for up to six months at a time. The route was closed at the end of 2013 when restrictions on nationals of the two eastern European countries working in Britain ended. Two scheme operators will run the new pilot, overseeing the placement of workers and ensuring they reach their place of employment and leave the UK at the end of their visa. The Home Office said it would be a tightly controlled regime, with return rates carefully monitored and provisions in place to close the route if it presents a threat to immigration controls.

Rhubarb, peas and asparagus, of course – they’re around for a few brief moments so we herald their arrival with zeal. Carrots are with us all year round so we take them for granted. But there are lots of reasons that carrots should get more attention – and respect. One reason is that 95 per cent of the carrots you find in the supermarket are homegrown, according to the British Carrot Growers Association. That makes carrots one of the easiest, no-brainer ways to buy British. How do we keep carrots on the shelf almost year round? In the 1990s, farmers started protecting carrots in the ground with a thick layer of straw so they could be picked throughout the year. Before that, carrots were a summer crop. The second reason is that few vegetables are as versatile as carrots. They’re happy roasted, boiled, raw or steamed, and have a natural sweetness, vibrant colour and crunch that makes them a star on the plate. And that’s reason enough to celebrate them all year round. Baby carrots with blood orange and grilled halloumi Serves 4 as a side dish Note: If you can’t find baby carrots, substitute with an equal quantity of large carrots but peel and cut into chunks. Parsley can be used to substitute for the carrot tops. 2 bunches baby carrots with tops, about 300-350g 250ml water 1 tbsp olive oil 1 tsp cumin seeds 1 tbsp runny honey 1 blood orange 200g halloumi Salt Trim the tops of the carrots, leaving a small bit of the green stem attached. Scrub the carrots, paying particular attention to the stem end, which can harbour bits of dirt. Save the small sprigs of carrot greens and set aside. Zest the blood orange and set aside. Place the carrots in a large frying pan. Cover with the water – it should not quite cover the carrots. Add in the olive oil and a generous sprinkle of salt. Cook over a high heat until the water is almost completely evaporated and the carrots just cooked through. Toss in the cumin seeds then the honey. Stir to coat the carrots. Juice half the blood orange and add to the carrots along with the orange zest. Lastly, add the reserved carrot tops and cook for around 30 seconds or until the tops start to wilt. Remove from the heat. Take another frying pan and heat on high. While it’s heating, take the halloumi and cut into 8 slices. Place the slices in the pan and cook for a minute or two until nicely browned. Repeat on the other side. Place the carrots with the halloumi on a plate and drizzle over any remaining pan juices from the carrots. Serve warm. @Juliapleonard Reuse content",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84,What Does Rescinding Obama-Era Federal Rules Mean For Recreational Marijuana?,Recreational marijuana laws across the country are up in the air,http://fortune.com/2018/01/04/what-does-rescinding-obama-era-federal-rules-mean-for-recreational-marijuana/,2018-01-04T22:34:55Z,"Thursday Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the Justice Department would be reversing several Obama-era rules pertaining to states that legalized marijuana. While several states such as Colorado, Oregon, and this week California have made cannabis legal to possess and use, it still remains illegal under federal law. Rules enacted by the Obama administration made it so the federal government agreed to not interfere with states that had voted to legalize the drug as long as that legalization didn’t interfere with other federal laws. Think things like drug trafficking. So, what does Sessions decision mean for legalized marijuana ? Right now, that’s sort of unclear. Sessions has said that he plans to leave the enforcement of the law up to U.S. attorneys in each state. In exceptionally green-friendly states, that might mean that nothing changes, but at the very least it makes the legality seem a bit murky. Specifically, he said prosecutors should take into account a department’s resources, the seriousness of the crime, and the deterrent effect of the prosecution before filing charges. While a judge might not choose to prosecute a marijuana business for growing or selling, he or she could choose to do so. That means getting involved in the industry, even in states where its ‘legal’ is now a bit of a gamble. Technically, people like growers and dispensary owners can now be prosecuted in recreationally legal states. The move could mean investors are less likely to fund marijuana-based companies. And Sessions might already have a few judges in green-friendly states who share his point of view. On Wednesday Sessions picked 17 U.S attorneys to serve in interim posts across the United States, several are posted in states such as Washington, Nevada, and California where marijuana is legal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85,The Financial Impact of the Romaine Lettuce E. Coli Outbreak Isn’t Over,"Grower, retailers and restaurants are still feeling the impact.",http://fortune.com/2018/05/30/romaine-lettuce-e-coli-outbreak-impacts/,2018-05-30T19:48:59Z,"It is “unlikely” that any romaine lettuce from Yuma, Arizona — the origin of E. coli contaminated greens — remain on grocery store shelves, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, along with the Food and Drug Administration. However, consumers, farmers and retailers are still feeling the impact. Beyond causing more than 150 people to become sick, the E. coli outbreak caused huge losses to growers, a drop in sales for retailers, and disrupted supply chains as restaurants scrambled to find romaine lettuce alternatives — and the impact could linger, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. “During the week of April 14 (the week the news broke), romaine dollar sales fell 20%, which pushed total lettuce performance down by double digits: iceberg lettuce dollar sales were down 19%; red leaf lettuce dollar sales fell 16%; and endive dollar sales dipped 17%,” according to a Nielsen report on National Salad Month. In May, Romaine sales fell nearly 45%, according to the WSJ, iceberg fell 22%, and red leaf fell 17%. Prices for whole heads of romaine lettuce were down 60%. For romaine lettuce growers it meant abandoning the popular green, or shifting production out of Arizona and into other areas like California. “Trucks all across the country were dumping romaine,” Drew McDonald, vice president of quality and food safety at Taylor Farms, told the WSJ. Retailers cleared romaine lettuce off shelves and are continuing to reassure and educate customers about the origin of their lettuce. “It’s [cost] thousands and thousands of dollars, it could even run into the millions,” Kroger Co.’s vice president of corporate food technology and regulatory compliance, Howard Popoola, told WSJ. Restaurants, too, have had to switch gears, change menus, and find new suppliers for different lettuce. Selling tainted food can also be costly for retailers and restaurants. A Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health study published in Public Health Reports in April of this year estimated that depending on the severity of the outbreak, a single foodborne illness incident can cost a fast food restaurant between $4,000 (no loss of revenue, fines or legal fees) to $1.9 million (fines, revenue lost, legal fees). Restaurants and retailers that were hit by lawsuits related to the romaine lettuce-related E. coli outbreak include Panera Bread, and Walmart’s Sam’s Club division Taylor Farms. “Promptly after the advisory was issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on April 13, 2018, we removed all romaine originating from the Yuma growing region from our cafes, and began looking for a new source,” Panera said on its website, noting that it now sources its romaine lettuce from California. The last harvest date of Yuma-grown romaine lettuce was April 16, and due to its 21-day shelf life, the FDA estimates that it is not likely to be on shelves or in restaurants.

""This is a brilliant time for English – and indeed Welsh – wines. In fact, the only issue is that supply is struggling to meet the demand for it,"" reports Liz Sagues, author of A Celebration of English Wine. Sagues puts it partly down to a warming climate, which means riper grapes, though she points out that ""climate change also has a big downside in more violent episodes of wind and rain - savvy growers recognise that they are likely to face two disastrous years in every 10."" Other factors contributing to the success of UK wines are, she says, ""a generally better understanding of where to locate vineyards. Vineyards are also becoming larger and more professionally run. Even more significant is the skill and dedication of the people who grow the grapes and make the wine."" We can look forward to even more wine production in the future, predicts Sagues, with barely 10 per cent of potentially suitable land planted so far. ""The production target for English and Welsh wine by 2020 is 10 million bottles a year. An estimated 5.9 million bottles were produced in 2017 - far higher than anticipated after the damaging April frosts - and the aim is 40 million by 2040, with a retail value of £1 billion."" Already, wine from Britain is exported to close to 30 countries and a third of production is predicted to go overseas by 2040. Major investment is going into the industry, she explains. ""During research for my book I visited two vineyards where more than £10 million had been spent, and that wasn't the end of what was happening. And, of course, the Champenois are investing: both Taittinger and Pommery have planted there (Kent and Hampshire respectively) and others are known to be interested. The appeal is understandable, as land prices are still appreciably lower than in champagne and England's higher-acid grapes are tempting."" We still haven’t quite caught up with our French counterparts, though. ""On recent averages, from the same area of vineyard, champagne producers make just over three times as many bottles as their southern English counterparts. Yet this top-quality English fizz is comparable in price, quite often less costly. So English fizz is good value for money."" And sparkling is getting even better in quality, she says, with some significant new names joining the justifiably renowned existing ones. Langham Rosé Brut, 2014: £26, Langham This salmon-pink Dorset sparkling cuvée won a gold at this year’s Independent English Wine Awards. Made from pinot noir and chardonnay grapes, you can expect rich red fruit aromas including cherry, strawberry and summer fruit pudding flavours, with honey and brioche also coming through. Extremely refreshing, it works well either as an aperitif or with dishes such as seafood linguine or crab cakes with dill aioli – or try it with fresh fruit. Earlier this year, the estate partnered with Dorset neighbours Purbeck Ice Cream to produce the first Langham Fizz Rosé Sorbet, which has been a huge hit at local restaurants and hotels. Buy now Camel Valley Brut, 2014: £27.95, Camel Valley Cornwall’s Camel Valley – where the Lindo family produces a mix of award-winning sparkling and still wines - has become the first English wine producer to be granted a royal warrant. This fresh, fruity combo of chardonnay, seyval blanc and pinot noir grapes provides green apple and zesty citrus on the nose, followed by rounded toasty and honeyed flavours and a prolonged finish. Winning a silver at this year’s International Wine Challenge, it boasts exceptionally fine bubbles and is a wonderful summery, celebration-worthy fizz. Buy now Wiston Estate Blanc de Noirs, 2010: £55, Hennings Wine This rich, complex single-vineyard wine has aromas of apple and hints of strawberries, rhubarb and nectarines on the palate, along with brioche and nutty influences, with a return to fruitiness for the elegant finish. Made from barrel-fermented pinot noir, with unceasing fine bubbles, you know you’re drinking something very special right from the first sip. And yet this is their first ever vintage blanc de noirs. Don’t hang around though - only 3,000 bottles were made by this family-owned South Downs vineyard. Buy now Hoffmann and Rathbone Blanc de Blancs Brut, 2011: £42, Hoffmann &amp; Rathbone Made from the chardonnay grape, this sophisticated and pale golden ‘white of whites’ from this top-drawer boutique Sussex wine producer is both fragrant and intense, with hints of herbs on the palate with a good acidity and a long, refreshing finish. The winery, located in the beautiful village of Mountfield, is run by husband and wife team Ulrich Hoffmann and Birgit Rathbone, where a lot of emphasis is put on the long ageing in their cellars. Be warned: they only create small amounts of their spectacular wines. Enjoy as an aperitif or with fresh oysters and other shellfish – or, for a main course food pairing, we’d recommend Dover sole and exotic Thai curries. Buy now Hambledon Classic Cuvée Rosé, NV: £35, Hambledon Vineyard Hambledon’s Classic Cuvée does consistently well in competitions and is always in demand, but it’s their Classic Cuvée Rosé that is really pushing the boundaries. Launched just over a year ago, the blend of 90 per cent chardonnay and 10 per cent pinot noir – mostly from the 2014 harvest - has already won four significant trophies. Vibrant and rich, this Hampshire Downs produced fizz has flavours of wild strawberry, sharp cranberry and exotic lemon. It’s creamy, with a beautifully crisp finish and although it makes a fabulous chilled aperitif, it also works well with food – but go savoury not sweet (think cold meats and charcuterie or brunch dishes such as scrambled eggs with smoked haddock or smoked bacon, which the touch of oak in the blend complements well). Buy now Tesco Finest English Sparkling Wine: £17.50, Tesco This blend of pinot noir, chardonnay and pinot meunier is a glorious pale gold, with a fresh bouquet of baked apples, stone fruits, citrus and hazelnut, while the taste gives way to apples, citrus and nuts. There’s a wonderful crispness with a delicate mousse and a long, elegant finish. Drink with white fish, poultry or fruit-based puds (especially strawberries). The wine comes from the Hush Heath Estate in Kent, one of the premium wine producers in England, which uses only estate grown grapes. Although the estate dates back to 1503, the first vines were planted in 2002. At under twenty quid, it’s remarkably good value. Buy now Ambriel Classic Cuvée, NV: £27.50, Ambriel Sparkling Redfold Vineyards, which are located on the south-facing slopes overlooking the South Downs, only produce sparkling wines. Their mid-priced and graceful mix of chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier has good acidity and length and delectable flavours of stewed apples and pears, complemented by brioche. Enjoy it with canapés and fish or on its own. Also look out for their new rosé (unfortunately not released yet) and for something unusual, their English Reserve is the only single-vineyard demi-sec and is a fabulous pudding sparkling or great with cheese. Meanwhile, their more expensive blanc de blancs won a silver at this year’s International Wine Challenge. Buy now Albourne Blanc de Blancs, 2013: £28.95, Albourne Estate If you like your fizz on the very dry side, then you’re in for a treat with this Sussex-made one that’s created from the chardonnay grapes using top-notch cuvée, the upshot of which is a highly complex and stylish sparkling wine. There’s an unusual pureness about it, with perfumed chardonnay aromas and hints of chalk and citrus, with baked apple, almond and patisserie on the tongue. A stunner on its own, it also complements a long list of foods, including crab, prawns and mussels, along with roast chicken or pork casserole – or, for the vegetarians, mushroom and truffle risotto. Up there with the best of English wines, we’re not surprised it scooped a silver at this year’s International Wine Challenge. Buy now Oxney Classic Dry, 2015: £35, Oxney Organic Estate This organic golden beauty is made traditionally with three grape types – chardonnay, pinot meunier and pinot noir – the result of which is a spectacular sparkling wine with hints of zesty citrus and sweet cherry, complemented by hints of honey. It works as an aperitif and with fish and shellfish and is extremely moreish. It comes from an East Sussex vineyard, six miles from Rye, that’s received no shortage of awards and accolades since its beginnings in 2012 – and which has three gorgeous barns available for holiday makers. Buy now Cottonworth Sparkling Rosé, 2014: £29.95, Cottonworth Winemaker Hugh Liddel was warned he was ""either too rich or too stupid"" when he announced plans to plant a vineyard in Hampshire. Twelve years and 30 acres later, he’s winning plenty of wine awards. While there’s no doubt they make a fabulous cuvée, we prefer their rosé, which is made with pinot meunier, pinot noir and pinot noir precoce. You get bright red fruit aromas of raspberry, cranberry and apple and a crisp, refreshing taste that marries the red berry flavours with soft vanilla notes. It is a perfect balance to spicy foods like medium to spicy curries, yet just as beautiful with a sweet dessert. Buy now Nyetimber Classic Cuvée NV: £34, Waitrose Creamy and rich, yet lively and fresh, the International Wine Challenge – which awarded it a silver medal this year - describes this Sussex-produced wine as a ""beautifully focussed lively wine, combining the cool climate zing of England with a mellow breadcrust aftertaste."" It has a fabulous fine mousse and flavours that combine a zesty citrus with brioche and lingering finish. Plenty of top hotels feature this as either their only English wine – or at the very least, a favourite - and it’s also a favourite at weddings where it is often chosen in preference to champagne. Buy now Ridgeview Fizrovia Rosé NV: £29.99, Waitrose This delicate blend of multiple vintages is the ultimate refreshing aperitif on a hot summer’s day, as well as pairing perfectly with strawberries or any dishes featuring smoked salmon. Made from chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier, it boasts fine bubbles, with raspberry and redcurrant on the nose and a fresh, fruit driven taste. The vineyard – which is located on the South Downs and uses the traditional champagne methods – has received over 250 medals and 27 trophies, including English Wine of the Year four times, since it was established back in 1995. Their wines are regularly served at Buckingham Palace. Buy now Hattingley Valley Rosé, 2014: £36, Hattingley Valley This Hampshire vineyard – which now exports to 14 countries - claims 2014 was its best yet, with almost perfect growing conditions. ""It was a mild spring for budburst, ideal conditions at flowering and high temperatures and plenty of sunshine throughout June and July,"" says head winemaker Emma Rice. Awarded a gold in this year’s Independent English Wine Awards (among others), this vegetarian and vegan friendly wine is refreshing and crisp with strawberry and redcurrant on the nose, moving into more red fruit with hints of brioche in the mouth. It’s gorgeous on its own and, if you’re feeling decadent, with lobster. Buy now Jenkyn Place Classic Cuvée, 2013: £29.50, Jenkyn Place Located in the North Hampshire Downs near Bentley, these vineyards cover 12 acres of former hop fields, where the sheltered, chalky, south-facing slopes 100 metres above sea level lend themselves to growing the grapes needed for top-notch English sparkling wines. This elegant golden classic cuvée, which is great for drinking on its own or with seafood canapés, has aromas of green apples, citrus and florals, while in the mouth it’s pure, crisp and ever so slightly tangy. It’s long awaited too – with the 2011 and 2012 harvests being disappointments following the fantastic 2010, these winemakers are back onto a winner with this one. Buy now Breaky Bottom Cuvée Cornelis Hendriksen, 2013: £33.50, Butlers Wine Cellar This blend of chardonnay, seyval blanc and noir grapes is produced by winemaker Peter Hall in an isolated farmstead set in a fold of the South Downs in East Sussex. He planted the six-acre vineyard back in 1974 and soon gained a reputation of making elegant Loire-style dry white wines. Today he makes only sparkling wines, following the traditional champagne method, and still on a small scale to produce top quality. This one has rounded toasty notes and hints of stone fruit and citrus, yet remains creamy with a lingering finish. It’s fabulous on its own, but also pairs nicely with the likes of lobster, crab, scallops, langoustine, prawns – and for the vegetarians – anything with asparagus in. Buy now The Verdict: English sparkling wines Tasked with choosing our absolute favourites was no mean feat. These 15 wines all stand out and are the results of a huge amount of hard work from extremely skilled winemakers. But forced to pick, we’re going with Langham Rosé Brut as best sparkling rosé because it’s about the most refreshing wine you could hope for on a hot summer’s day and Camel Valley Brut as best sparking white for its toasty, honeyed notes – perfect for any special occasion.

Yes, it's time for the 2018 World Cup — now with 100 per cent more Vladimir Putin! While it may be the most popular game on Earth, that doesn't mean everyone watching the action from Russia is a soccer expert — and that may include you. No worries.

Basically: 32 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 →1 world champion. A reminder: perennial favourites Italy and the Netherlands are not in this year's edition. Perennial disappointments will also be missing (howdy, United States!), as will perennial no-shows (Oh, Canada...).

Title odds: 203/1 GROUP E Team : Brazil Nickname : Seleção (The Squad) Interesting World Cup stat : Brazil is the last country to win back-to-back World Cup championships, in 1958 and 1962.

Biggest star : Neymar Ludicrous display of knowledge : Neymar made his return from a four-month injury absence in June against Croatia and immediately scored the opening goal. Title odds: 4/1 Team : Costa Rica Nickname : Los Ticos Interesting World Cup stat : Lost 4-3 on penalty kicks in the 2014 World Cup quarter-finals to the Netherlands, which didn't even manage a berth in this year's edition.

Title odds: 100/1 Team : Serbia Nickname : The White Eagles Interesting World Cup stat : Serbia fell in the group stage of its last World Cup appearance in 2010, but not before picking up a marquee 1-0 win over Germany.

Title odds: 4/1 Team : South Korea Nickname : The Taegeuk Warriors Interesting World Cup stat : The Koreans will be making their 10th World Cup appearance, which is the most of any Asian nation. Their best result was fourth in 2002, when they co-hosted with Japan. Biggest star : Son Heung-Min Ludicrous display of knowledge : Decided long shots to get past the group stage, the team nonetheless faces a lot of pressure from its fans.

Title odds: 581/1 Team : Mexico Nickname : El Tri Interesting World Cup stat : The Mexican squad is going for its seventh consecutive berth in the round of 16, but has only reached the quarter-finals twice (1986, 1970).

Title odds: 908/1 Team : Tunisia Nickname : The Eagles of Carthage Interesting World Cup stat : Although they've made four previous World Cup appearances (1978, 1998, 2002 and 2006), the Eagles have never advanced past the group stage.

88,Erie's mushroom kingdom: Exotic mushrooms abound,"ERIE, Pa. (AP) — Pennsylvania is far and away the largest producer of mushrooms in the U.S., mostly the white ""button"" variety, grown on 68 farms mostly in the Philadelphia region. That's been true for generations.",https://apnews.com/d060a8c7b9674a469c5b419db3183af0,2018-08-11T07:01:00Z,"ERIE, Pa. (AP) — Pennsylvania is far and away the largest producer of mushrooms in the U.S., mostly the white ""button"" variety, grown on 68 farms mostly in the Philadelphia region. That's been true for generations. Now, for many reasons — Americans' widening interest for food grown and produced locally, a focus on low-carb diets, and encouragement of farmers by the USDA to monetize their forests — exotic mushrooms are sprouting up in this neck of the woods. Harry Leslie, former manager of Presque Isle State Park, retired to his family farm in Conneaut Lake in 2015. The farm includes 40 acres of commercial crops, such as corn and soybeans, and 60 acres of forest. Receive today's headlines in your inbox with our daily news email SUBSCRIBE TODAY ""I knew I was retiring, and my son and I went to a workshop at (Holden Arboretum in Kirtland, Ohio) on sustainable forest farming,"" Leslie said. ""I wanted to know what I could do with the woods."" So they learned to inoculate oak logs, salvaged from around their farmed land, to grow shiitake and oyster mushrooms, both edible and fetching $5.50 to $7 a pound at grocery stores. That entails drilling holes in the logs, stuffing them with sawdust and ""mycelium,"" the living filaments that produce mushrooms, sealing the holes with wax, and waiting. It takes about a year for mycelium to colonize a log and start producing mushrooms. But produce they did. Now, if you get on Leslie's list, he'll tell you when the mushrooms are in a ""flush,"" or growing, which happens about once every six to eight weeks in the summer for his shiitakes, depending on rainfall. You tell him how many pounds of mushrooms you want and he harvests, packs them up and hauls them to the Tom Ridge Environmental Center, where you can pick them up. He charges a dollar or two less per pound than the stores, adding that he doesn't really raise mushrooms for the money. ""I enjoy it,"" he said. ""It's a hobby for me."" He does plan to expand by 100 logs in 2019. ""It's a neat process because it's cradle-to-grave,"" he said, meaning he's using logs cut from around his farmland and keeping his woods in constructive use. Gordon Post, of Post Apples CSA, fills bags with produce he grows and delivers it to subscribers throughout the growing season. He started growing mushrooms four years ago. ""We just did it to get more variety for the CSA,"" he said. ""It really worked."" Like Leslie, he has shiitake and oyster mushrooms. Oyster mushrooms came on before his shipments this spring (they are a late-spring mushroom), but he's still waiting on shiitakes. ""The first year we didn't get anything,"" Post said. ""The second year we had a huge crop and our third crop was huge. This year was huge early, but now we're waiting for (the shiitakes) to flush."" He said it has been pretty dry at his farm, so they've been irrigating water over the logs every few days. Big little farm A farmer at Green Heron Growers, 2361 Wait Corner Road in Sherman, New York, has a pretty large shiitake mushroom operation compared to Leslie and Post, with 2,000 logs in production. He takes them to farmers markets in Lakewood, New York; Jamestown, New York; and Chautauqua, New York; as well as at his farm store. Steve Rockcastle, who co-owns the farm with his wife, Julie, started growing shiitakes in 2008 in the same woods where the annual The Great Blue Heron Music Festival takes place. He said it all started when his son came home to visit from Cornell, where he was studying landscape architecture. ""We were walking through woods and came to a hemlock grove,"" Rockcastle said. ""(My son) said it would be great for growing shiitake mushrooms. I was looking for ways to use the woods and it turned out we had the right conditions, so we jumped into it."" He said the market for fresh, local shiitakes is steady and growing ""There's not a lot of supply, so generally, the market's good in summertime,"" he said. ""The longer we stay involved, we get repeat customers who try the product and like them. We also give samples to get people encouraged to try it, and once they do, they come back."" Feel like a walk? There's another, more adventurous way to get your exotic mushroom fix: Go out in the woods and look for them. Now, no one is suggesting you do this by yourself with no idea what you're doing. There are tens of thousands of mushroom species and while the vast majority are perfectly safe, some are dangerous. And, frankly, most just don't taste all that good. You also have to keep in mind whose land you're hiking and what their rules are for wild mushroom harvesting. But finding the right wild mushroom at just the right time can feel like finding buried treasure, especially if you like to cook. Easy to identify, tasty wild mushrooms in this region include chicken of the woods, lion's mane, maitake (also called hen of the woods), the ever-coveted springtime morels and chanterelles. It's best to befriend and go out a few times with a mushroom expert such as Garrett Taylor, a mycologist (mushroom expert) with the Western Pennsylvania Mushroom Club, who can show you how to spot the good ones and appreciate the beauty of the not-so-tasty ones, and point out a patch of Destroying Angels or Deadly Galarina when necessary. Taylor can identify hundreds of mushrooms, and show you cool things about them, such as the tart taste of the water that seeps out of it, the bright blue it turns when you break it open and the milky droplets that appear when you stroke the gills. He can show you what kinds of trees to look for when hunting edibles (cherry, oaks) and the beauty of the tiniest ""birds nest"" mushroom, that looks for all the world like a ¼-inch nest holding three eggs. Taylor is also a chef at Seneca Allegany Resort &amp; Casino, which is kind of how he wound up traipsing around in the woods. ""I read a book by (chef) Jacques Pepin,"" Taylor said. ""I was training myself to cook and the book said to find a mycology society."" He now likes to go on mushroom hikes with the mushroom club, especially the identification process. ""It gets kind of competitive,"" he said. Walking a trail behind the Woodcock Creek Nature Center near Saegertown, he saw and identified mushrooms such as amanitas (mostly harmless, though not all), russulas, boletes, trametes, polypores, pointing out mushrooms that crafters like to use as natural dyes. How did he get to be a mycologist? He learned to identify 10 mushrooms, then 25, then 100 and finally in the 500 range. While hiking up a hill, he offered culinary advice for using a good-sized chicken-of-the-woods. ""Cook it for a really long time, like ribs,"" he said. ""Leave it whole and eat it like a barbecued chicken sandwich."" He said while food was what got him into mushrooms, he's now hooked on the subject from every angle. And he's seen that happen to a lot of people. ""More people are interested in what they can eat,"" he said. ""Now I'm interested in whatever is out there."" From Bradford, Taylor said he thinks the Erie area needs its own mushroom club because the WPMC is centered in Pittsburgh, though it travels to the peninsula once in a while. ?(Mushroom hunting) is something anybody can do,"" Taylor said. ""It's not hidden from the world. It's out here for anyone to enjoy."" Later, up by the nature center, he poured over a patch of bright, pure white mushrooms. ""Destroying Angels,"" he said, picking one out of the ground to point out the bulbous base, with assurances that you can't get sick from touching it. ""Don't want to eat these."" ——— Online: https://bit.ly/2OPv8AU ——— Information from: Erie Times-News, http://www.goerie.com Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

89,Florida editorial roundup,Recent editorials from Florida newspapers:,https://apnews.com/81dc5a29c0b244138fb6f70ae83234f4,2018-07-12T02:16:24Z,"Recent editorials from Florida newspapers: ——— July 10 Receive today's headlines in your inbox with our daily news email SUBSCRIBE TODAY The Gainesville Sun says algae blooms are part of Gov. Rick Scott's legacy: Gov. Rick Scott is facing an environmental crisis of his own making. Scott issued an emergency order Monday in response to the toxic algae bloom covering most of Lake Okeechobee. Such declarations won't undo years of environmental degradation allowed in Florida under Scott and other Republican officials. Their current solution is typical, requiring hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to be spent cleaning up a mess that elected officials helped create. Repairing the dike around Lake Okeechobee and building a new reservoir might prevent water releases from further contaminating the river systems around the lake, but such steps fail to address the pollution fueling algae blooms. Scott and the GOP-controlled Legislature have made it easier to pollute Florida's natural environment during his two terms in office. They've slashed the budgets of water managers, eliminated an agency that regulated growth, cut enforcement of environmental regulations and spent money slated for land conservation on other uses. Scott is a climate-change denier whose agencies were forbidden to use the words climate change much less do anything about it. A recent report in the Tampa Bay Times suggests that climate change makes algae blooms such as the one in Lake Okeechobee and a long-running red tide along Florida's west coast more likely to occur. Climate change is causing water to warm and tends to produce more rain, leading to more runoff into water bodies. Warming water — combined with runoff from agricultural operations, septic tanks and other sources — can cause algae blooms that used to be smaller and more sporadic to be bigger and longer lasting. The bloom in Lake Okeechobee was estimated earlier this month to cover 90 percent of the 740-acre lake, with its green color able to be seen from space. Algae blooms are also happening to the east and west of the lake in the St. Lucie and Caloosahatchee river systems, a problem that also occurred two years ago after water releases from the lake. The algae can kill animals, can cause respiratory problems and other health issues in humans, and has been linked to diseases such Alzheimer's and ALS. It also causes economic damage to businesses that rely on tourism and outdoor activities such as boating and fishing. Scott has blamed the federal government rather than take responsibility for his administration's role in the environmental crisis. His emergency order — which requires steps such as expanded water testing and clean-up grants — is way too little, way too late. Scott is now running for the U.S. Senate and Agricultural Commissioner Adam Putnam is running for governor. Both have been hostile to meaningful environmental regulations, instead favoring voluntary measures to control pollution from agricultural operations such as the sugar cane growers in the Everglades area. Voters need to keep their environmental records in mind when casting ballots in the upcoming elections. From the polluted and depleted springs in our region to the algae blooms to the south, voters can see for themselves what happens when elected officials fail to protect the environment. Online: http://www.gainesville.com/ ——— July 6 The Ledger of Lakeland on a new aimed at dealing with robocallers and telemarketers: Each year Florida's Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services releases Florida residents' top gripes about business' bad behavior. And typically leading the list — by a long shot, with nearly half of overall complaints in 2016 and 2017, for example — are the telemarketers and robocallers who violate the state's ""Do Not Call"" law. It's also a major problem for Floridians on a national scale. The Federal Trade Commission, which regulates the national Do Not Call List, reported that in 2017 Florida residents filed 588,000 of the 3.5 million complaints it received for unwanted telephonic solicitation. But recently, Florida residents got some much-needed help in this regard — thanks to lawmakers from Polk County's delegation: state Sen. Denise Grimsley, a Sebring Republican who represents the southern half of Polk County, and state Rep. Sam Killebrew, R-Winter Haven. The pair sponsored a new state law, which recently took effect, that empowers telephone companies to proactively block calls from numbers of suspected robocallers or ""spoof"" callers, or those who utilize a fake number to disguise the real number from which they are calling. In a recent meeting with The Ledger's editorial board, Grimsley told us her advocacy was based on personal experience. She had to deal with ""Elizabeth,"" an aggressive and annoying prerecorded telemarketer who made repeated calls to Grimsley in an effort to sell her a vacation package. Federal and state laws already prohibit much of this activity. For instance, consumers who enroll on the federal or state do-not-call lists are supposed to be shielded from such calls, except under certain circumstances, which can include having a prior relationship with the company or if the call comes from a charity, pollster, or political campaign. Yet, as a House staff analysis of the new law noted, ""Many robocalls and spoofed calls are made without regard to the laws in place to prevent them."" One reason is that these callers, many of which are scammers or identity thieves, utilize new technology to circumvent the lists. Grimsley shared with us that another key reason for that is the phone companies themselves weren't permitted to block such calls, except when people were members of the do-not-call registry. This new law changes that, and should help reduce such activity, she added. What's noteworthy about this new law is that it builds on the work of the industry. According to the House analysis, the Federal Communications Commission in 2016 urged the telecommunications industry to help address this problem, and from that emerged the Robocall Strike Force. One task force recommendation entailed the creation of a ""Do Not Originate"" list, a compilation of phone numbers known to be illegitimate. Last November the FCC adopted the recommendation, which also helped form the basis of Florida's new law. Under the new statute, telecom providers can now block calls if the customer requests so after recognizing a number is for inbound calls only, if the number is not a valid phone number (such as consisting of just one repeated digit), or if the number has not been allocated to a provider or has been allocated but has not been used or assigned to a customer. As the government acknowledges, no law is perfect. So it's possible the scammers and the irritating ""Elizabeths"" will still find a way through this electronic wall. But we appreciate the work of Grimsley, Killebrew and the rest of the Legislature to help reduce consumers' frustration level and protect them from the fraudsters. Online: http://www.theledger.com/ ——— July 8 The Florida Times-Union says voters should prepare for confusing amendments this fall: The Florida Constitution should only be amended in important cases in which the Legislature is incapable or unwilling to act. Florida provides several methods for placing constitutional amendment proposals on the ballot. One involves citizen initiatives. Another involves the Constitution Revision Commission, which meets every 20 years. Two previous commissions had mixed success. In 1978 voters rejected all eight ballot proposals of the commission. In 1998 voters approved eight of nine proposals. But this third commission proved to be just as dysfunctional as the Legislature. It has eight proposals for the voters; six of the eight involve multiple issues. That's right, voters in November will see several examples in which two to four proposals are lumped together in one vote. This ought to be unconstitutional. Sadly, we may need an amendment to force future commissions to limit proposals to one issue at a time. And it's an outrage that some of the ballot language is misleading and vague. Let's take proposal 6003: Voters will see this title: ""Amendment 8: School board term limits and duties; public schools."" That sounds innocent enough; sure, as innocent as a wolf in sheep's clothing.. The first issue would create eight-year term limits for school boards. Voters generally approve of term limits, but this ought to be a home rule issue for individual counties. Some sparsely populated rural counties may prefer no term limits or longer limits.. The second issue involves misleading ballot language that allows the state to operate and control charter schools, not the local school board. But it's not stated that way.. The third issue would require promotion of civic literacy. This is not even needed. The Legislature already has a requirement for civil literacy education and it's fully willing and able to amend it. But this appears to be a device to sneak through the charter school amendment. Some have called for voting down all of the multiple issue amendments. That certainly would be better than voting for all of them. However, there is one group of amendments that is not controversial and deserves passage. It would remove an outdated alien land law provision from the constitution, remove high speed rail language from the constitution and clarify applicability of a repealed criminal statute. Voters won't be taking up the amendments till the November general election. But along with the eight proposals (20 issues in all), there are five other constitutional matters on the ballot for a total of 13. That means long lines on Election Day will be long as voters try to sort out this mess. We recommend voters consider early voting or requesting write-in ballots so they can take their time. One matter that deserved to be on the ballot involved a Constitutional Amendment that passed in 1998 with 64 percent of the vote. If the winner of a primary has no opposition in the general election, then all qualified voters, regardless of party, can vote in the primary. The primary in effect is the general election. But Republicans and Democrats gamed the system by encouraging write-in candidates to file, which the Florida Supreme Court decided meant that the primary was closed, leaving the general election to a race between a strong candidate and a token write-in. Never mind no write-in candidate has ever won an election in Florida, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Democrats in South Florida and Republicans in North Florida like having elections all to themselves. Yet the numbers of NPA voters (No Party Affiliation) are growing. In some counties, NPA voters represent the second-largest political group. This proposal was shockingly voted down by the Constitution Revision Commission, probably because many of the members owed their allegiance to political appointments. Ten of those who voted against it were appointed by the governor and five the speaker of the House, said local attorney Hank Coxe, a member of the commission. This means that there should be a citizens' initiative to close the write-in loophole. A poll conducted by the Florida Chamber of Commerce showed that just four of the 13 constitutional proposals have the 60 percent support needed to pass. The stealth charter school item with a ballot title focusing in term limits, unfortunately, is one of them. Online: http://www.jacksonville.com/ Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

90,9 best plastic-free teabags,Be good to the planet – without sacrificing the most important drink of the day,https://www.independent.co.uk/extras/indybest/food-drink/9-best-plasticfree-teabags-a8505981.html,2018-09-03T09:26:03Z,"Most teabags contain plastic – who knew? About 96 per cent of teabags are made with polypropylene – a synthetic resin – which is added during the sealing process. Fortunately, there's such a thing as plastic-free teabags – and we've found some of the best. Some plastic-free teabags are compostable. This means that they can decompose back into natural elements in your garden within a year. The compost is then great for fertilising the soil. Others are biodegradable. These can also decompose back into natural elements, but it takes much longer for them to do so at home. Instead, you'd be better off throwing them out with your rubbish so that they can go through an industrial process. Here’s our round-up of teabags that are free of plastic. Read more We Are Tea, £3 for 15, Morrisons.com This whole-leaf tea company started in 2007, and were the first brand to remove the paper tags from teabags. In 2012, We Are Tea joined the Ethical Tea Partnership, supporting small estate growers and moved from nylon bags to ones made from a bi-product of cornstarch called soilon. Each teabag is sealed by ultrasound instead of glue, which makes them biodegradable at an industrial level between three and six months, so make sure you put them in your council food waste bin. It can go in your home compost, but it will take much longer (at least 18 months). The plastic inner part of the packaging is not recyclable, but the team are working on changing this and using natureflex, which is a woodpulp and takes between three to six months to decompose at home. Buy now Eteaket, from £4.95 for 15 Eteaket is a cafe in Edinburgh, serving ethically sourced tea. A member of the Ethical Tea Partnership, it opened in 2008 and sells its own brews in teabags as well as loose leaf tea. The teabags are made from soilon, which isn’t bleached and is biodegradable. The tag is made from paper which isn't laminated and is attached to the string using ultrasound. From September, the inner packaging will be made from natureflex, which is also recyclable. This means it will be fine to put in the compost at home. Buy now Nemi Tea, £5.99 for 15, Nemiteas.com Nemi tea launched in October 2017. The pyramid bags are made from soilon. They are the only guaranteed GM-free ones on our list and are completely biodegradable at an industrial level. The string and labels are both attached using ultrasound rather than glue, and all the tea is packaged in naturflex. The brand also helps refugees integrate into the UK by employing them to run their tea stalls. Buy now Roqberry, £6 for 18 After launching last year, Roqberry champions “blending the rules” by using classic blends to create modern fusions such as “aromatic sushi and spice” and “black smoke”. These pyramid teabags, made from soilon, encase the single-source tea that comes in black, green, herbal, rooibos and oolong, and all are biodegradable. As it won’t breakdown in under a year, this teabag should be thrown out with your council food waste as soilon composes at industrial standards (in six to eight weeks). The cube boxes are made from FSC paper that’s easily recyclable, too. Buy now Pukka Herbs, £2.50 for 20, Hollandandbarrett.com Pukka teas launched in 2001. Each bag is wrapped in an envelope so that it stays fresh – and is more environmentally friendly than you might think. Since May, it contains only a very thin layer of BPA and PVC-free plastic, so it can be recycled with paper. It took the team four years to develop the packaging, removing more than 100 tonnes of plastic from the supply chain. Look closely and you'll find that the organic string and plastic-free label are attached using a little stitch rather than a staple. Buy now Teapigs, £3.99 for 15, Ocado.com Teapigs was the first brand to receive the world’s first plastic-free trust mark, created by the campaign group A Plastic Planet in May. These biodegradable bags are made from cornstarch, while the paper tags use vegetable inks and are, you'll be glad to read, non-toxic. Don’t be dismayed when you open your box, as even the clear “plastic” inner bag (made from natureflex) is compostable. The bags can go in your home food recycling bin for compost, which may feel strange, but they will compost. Buy now Good &amp; Proper Tea, £5 for 15 teabags, Goodandpropertea.com What began life as a mobile tea bar has now found a permanent home as a cafe in east London. The plastic-free range was added in 2017 and is made from the non-toxic material soilon, which should go in a collected food waste bin. They are the largest bags we tested and are the only one that comes in a flat, large, square shape, instead of a pyramid. Bags are packaged in a plastic alternative, the plant-based material Vegware, which is compostable, but at industrial levels. Buy now T2, £7.50 for 25, T2tea.com This Australian brand, launched in 1996 in Melbourne, reached the UK in 2014, establishing itself in east London. It now has 14 shops in the capital, and it takes its sustainability seriously. The opaque bags are made from cornstarch and are completely biodegradable in your council food waste. The bags will break down in home composting, but this can take 18 to 24 months, so it’s best to put them into your local council food compost, where the process will be faster. The inner plastic is not recyclable, but the brand is planning to switch this to a plant-based material by 2020. If you like your tea strong, add just the tiniest drop of milk to your cuppa with these bags as the flavour tends to come out quite weak. Buy now Twinings loose leaf pyramid bag, £6.50 for 15, Twinings.co.uk Twinings' pyramid teabags have always been plastic-free. They are made from maize starch treated by an enzyme that allows it to be spun into filaments. The teabags include loose-leaf tea, which makes an excellent brew. However, each bag has a label attached that’s covered in a thin layer of plastic – so it won’t dissolve if it ends up in your brew, apparently – and will need to be removed before composting. The inner foil wrapper isn’t recyclable, but Twinings is currently trying to find alternatives. Buy now Verdict: Plastic free tea bags We Are Tea came out top partly because the bags don't have a string or a label. We were also impressed by its efforts to source its tea as ethically as possible and its support for small tea-growing estates. The inner plastic bag isn’t recyclable, but the brand is working on changing it. We'd be proud to serve Teapigs, too – for its total lack of plastic and for its reliable taste. ​ IndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.

91,Is Climate Change Coming for Your Champagne?,How French winemakers are rallying both science and tradition to save the sparkler.,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-06/is-climate-change-coming-for-your-champagne,2018-08-06T05:26:25Z,"In the cold, chalky cellars deep underground at boutique Champagne house A.R. Lenoble, co-owner Antoine Malassagne shares his worries about the future of the region’s world-famous fizz. Its classic style depends on crisp, zingy acidity and edgy, fruity, salty, mineral flavors, the result of deep, chalky soil and an until-now very cool climate. But here’s his question: How can the taste we love stay the same in the face of climate change? So far, global warming has mostly put chilly Champagne in a climatic sweet spot, with average temperatures that ensure grapes ripen every year. But that's not the whole story, says Malassagne. Buds appear earlier, so spring frosts are more destructive. Warmer nights push maturity but also encourage new pests and diseases. “Harvest is two weeks earlier than it was 20 years ago,” he explains on a very hot July morning at his winery in Damery, a 15-minute drive from Epernay, Champagne’s epicenter. “It used to be mid-to-late September. Now harvest often starts in August, as it will this year. But maturity during hot days and nights results in lower and lower acidity in the grapes, which means less freshness in the wines.” It’s also essential to Champagne’s taste: Acidity is what allows the wines to age. In 2010, Malassagne started working on ways to make sure there was enough, well, zing in his future bubbly. Magnums of AR Lenoble in the cellar. Champagne’s basic technique of blending different varieties (chardonnay, pinot noir, and sometimes meunier), vineyards, and vintages is the way winemakers compensated for poor years. Reserve wine from older vintages, for example, added depth, complexity, and richness when grapes didn’t fully ripen. Now Malassagne is creating reserve wines to add “freshness,” too, by conserving them in magnums under natural cork to preserve brighter flavors. Some 70,000 of these are stockpiled in the long, dimly lit cellar. His two lively, delicious new cuvées—Lenoble Intense “mag 14” and Lenoble Grand Cru Blanc de Blancs Chouilly “mag14”, launched in May—are the first to incorporate these new reserves. That’s only one of the many ways the Champenois are trying to maintain the sparkling style we know. Champagne Bruno Paillard is experimenting with covering the soil in vineyards with straw to prevent sunlight from destroying microbial life. Others are using winemaking techniques such as blocking malolactic fermentation (the second fermentation in the barrel that converts fresh-tasting malic acid to softer lactic acid) to bring greater perceived acidity to the wine. Anne &amp; Antoine Malassagne of AR Lenoble Over the past two decades, Jean-Baptiste Lecaillon, the chef de cave at super-star Louis Roederer, has been systematically experimenting with everything from biodynamic viticulture to DNA analysis of yeast to gentler forms of pruning and reinventing winemaking techniques for chardonnay, all “to maintain what has made Champagne’s reputation.” Roederer is the most innovative large producer in Champagne right now, and its superb wines are just getting better and better. The current non-vintage Brut Premier is the best I’ve ever tasted, and the just-released, brilliant 2008 (from an old-style, cool vintage with a late harvest that continued into October) has a precision and purity that seem almost electric. One of Lecaillon’s solutions to climate change is to give more natural resilience to the vineyard ecosystem, so the vines can withstand new insects and more extreme conditions. “My conclusion is that with biodynamics, the vines have more energy,” he says. “With deeper roots, they’re better able to handle heat and drought, and the wines have more freshness.” As we sample great vintages of Roederer’s top cuvée Cristal over lunch, Lecaillon sounded hopeful as he reminds me: “We invented bubbles to make up for unripe grapes. As farmers, our job, our life, our passion has been to adapt to climate change for hundreds of years. If the future heats up too much,” he jokes (I think), “we’ll just have to make Burgundy.” How bad is the threat, anyway? The 2003 heat wave, when France baked in record summer temperatures, was a wake-up call for many growers. Over the last six months in 2018, according to the Comité Champagne (CIVC) trade association, the region has been 2 degrees hotter than normal, and this will be the fifth vintage of the last 15 to start harvest in August. Growers say it’s alarming that temperatures have risen so quickly. A European Academies’ Science Advisory Council (EASAC) report published earlier this year also described how droughts, fires, freakish weather patterns, and extreme heat waves have more than doubled since 1980. But despite heat and several violent hailstorms, this year will see a bumper crop—unless hail hits again before harvest. Can grape tech save the day? Technology offers more potential solutions. Over breakfast in Reims, Thibaut Le Mailloux, the communications director of the CIVC, outlined one of the organization’s long-term projects, a team effort with the French National Institute for Agricultural Research to invent new hybrid grape varieties that will ripen more slowly in warmer conditions and be more resistant to pests. Since 2010, their scientists have been crossing pinot noir, chardonnay, and meunier, the three most important grapes with super-géniteur varieties. Starting with 4,000 seeds planted in the CIVC’s experimental vineyard, several will eventually be selected that seem to have the resistant genes, and also—this is the catch—offer the same distinctive flavors and acidity. The next step will be to see whether wines made from those grapes age in the same way. All this will take a couple of decades. Only seven grape varieties are permitted in Champagne. In addition to the three most important, four mostly forgotten grapes—petite meslier, pinot blanc, fromenteau, and arbane—may gain prominence in the future. Lean, green petit meslier grapes, for example, retain huge acidity, even in very hot vintages. Family-owned Champagne Drappier is one of a handful of wineries reviving these. What about carbon cutting? The CIVC first assessed the industry’s carbon footprint in 2002. Since then, the region’s growers have significantly cut emissions, taken to recyclying all the water used in wineries, reduced pesticides by 50 percent, and begun using lighter-weight Champagne bottles, the equivalent in emissions of removing 8,000 cars from the road each year. Future-focused Drappier became the first Champagne house to be carbon-neutral, and in 2017 began using a bottle made from 87 percent recycled glass. To encourage electric vehicle use, it has set up charging stations. The younger generation, such as Cedric Moussé, who manages his eponymous family winery, has a heightened sensibility about climate change. Moussé was 23 when the CIVC began talking about producers reducing their carbon footprints. “There are 1,000 small things we can do,” he says, as he walks me through his eco-conception of a winery. “I think about every choice, from how to plant vines, so grapes take more time to mature, to using bottles, labels, shipping boxes and machinery produced less than 50 miles away.” But will it be enough?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92,Little Beans Bring Big Farm Losses as Global Glut Mashes Exports - Bloomberg,Bloomberg Little Beans Bring Big Farm Losses as Global Glut Mashes Exports Bloomberg The little lentil and the humble pea -- staples for vegetarians all over the world -- are having a big impact on the declining profitability of some Canadian farmers and food…,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-22/little-beans-bring-big-farm-losses-as-global-glut-mashes-exports,2017-11-22T04:04:18Z,"The little lentil and the humble pea -- staples for vegetarians all over the world -- are having a big impact on the declining profitability of some Canadian farmers and food makers. Not only have lentil prices tumbled more than 30 percent in the past year, but the largest consumer, India, had bumper harvests and is trying to unload its surplus inventory. Exports of so-called pulse crops by Canada, the top grower and shipper, are down by about half. Regina, Saskatchewan-based AGT Food &amp; Ingredients Inc., a big seller of pulses, has reported four straight quarters of losses and its shares are down 46 percent in 2017. “It’s hard to get somebody willing to buy right now,” said Saskatchewan farmer Brad Blackwell, who seeded one third of his 8,000 acres with red lentils this year. “Prices are quite dismal.” The outlook has gone from bad to worse, disrupting a business that was enjoying the highest prices ever as recently as early 2016. Since then, farmers have expanded production, creating a global glut. In Canada alone, the number of acres devoted to lentils jumped 62 percent from four years earlier while pea plantings climbed 23 percent, government data show. Lentil shipments in the three months through October dropped to 88,200 metric tons, down 71 percent from the same period a year earlier, Canadian Grain Commission data show. Exports of dried peas, another major pulse crop that Canada producers, dropped 39 percent to 849,900 tons. In India, where the legumes are cooked with curry spices, sauces or butter and eaten at most meals with rice and flat bread, demand for imported pulses is fading. Farms have rebounded from the weak monsoon rains that devastated crops back in 2014. The country also is importing more peas and lentils from Eastern Europe that are cheaper than Canadian supplies, said Marlene Boersch, managing partner of Mercantile Consulting Venture in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Record Crop India harvested 23 million tons of pulses in the 2016-2017 crop year that ended in July, up 28 percent from a year earlier, said Colin Topham, president of the Canadian Special Crops Association. The government on Nov. 16 scrapped export curbs, and a ministerial council is reviewing the trade policies on pulses. The country has imposed import taxes on peas, which Topham says means prices are poised to drop further. In the week of Nov. 9, Canadian yellow peas had their biggest weekly decline on record, falling 25 percent to $6 a bushel, according to Brian Clancey, president and senior market analyst at Vancouver-based Stat Communications Ltd. Grower bids for red lentils slid 19 percent during the same week, while bids for large green lentils tumbled 18 percent, he said. “We’re working through our first global pulse oversupply in many years,” Topham said by telephone from Winnipeg, Manitoba. Complicating the outlook are new Indian penalties on Canadian shipments, ending an earlier waiver that exempted them from having to fumigate dried peas and lentils. Farmers in Saskatchewan are being offered about 19 Canadian cents a pound for red lentils, down from more than 30 Canadian cents a year earlier, Blackwell said. As a result, the return for growers on pulses are no longer as attractive as grains or oilseeds, Clancey said. The dropoff in demand is putting the squeeze on companies that make their living selling pulses to consumers, including AGT Food &amp; Ingredients. Big buyers including India and Turkey have cut back, and policy changes in India have created a “sense of general malaise” in the market, said Chief Executive Officer Murad Al-Katib. “This recovery to more normalized conditions is now expected to come more slowly than previously estimated,” Al-Katib said on an earnings call with analysts on Nov. 6. Al-Katib did not respond to a Bloomberg request for an interview. In the meantime, some farmers are relying on other crops, including wheat and canola, to pay the bills. Blackwell, the Saskatchewan grower, says he will hold onto his lentils for awhile to see if prices recover, but probably will plant less of it next year because returns are so lousy. “I’ll wait til the new year and see where the market goes,” Blackwell said. “Demand worldwide is down.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Whether you're an accountant or a contractor or whatever it is, there's a cannabis angle to what you're doing. And we need you. We need people with those skill sets in the cannabis industry,"" Grant McLeod, senior vice president at Beleave Kannabis Inc. said. ""We're looking to hire administrative people; we're looking to hire technical people, we're looking to hire growers — the entire industry is ramping up,"" he added. The hiring team at Radicle Inc., another production facility in the city with government contracts, is also gearing up for a busy year. They currently hire over 20 full-time Hamilton-based employees. But ""with the successful Ontario Cannabis Store bid, the company is on track to build the business to over 200 full-time jobs,"" Radicle Inc. said in an email. ""Hamilton has an educated and a strong labour pool near a lot of colleges and universities,"" McLeod said, explaining why the city is ripe for the green rush. Relatively cheap real estate (compared to Toronto) is also an incentive, he explained. ""Agricultural land is being scooped up. It's a lot of property that maybe wasn't being utilized fully, given the downturn in the last couple of decades, now being re-purposed and utilized."" Beleave Kannabis is planning to set up a second facility in Southwestern Ontario while Radicle Inc. is looking to ""expand to a 150,000 square feet facility,"" a representative told CBC News. The companies learned that they were on the list of 26 suppliers of the Ontario cannabis store — the only legal retailer of recreational cannabis in Ontario — a few days before the official announcement was made. ""We were very happy, so very proud,"" McLeod recalled. ""Ontario is the biggest market in Canada and likely will be the largest purchaser of cannabis product in the world,"" he said. ""Any time you can access 40 per cent of the marketplace in any sector — that's that's a big deal."" Youssef Reda, Chief Marketing Officer of Radicle says ​his team was ""beyond ecstatic"" when they learned they won the bid to supply OCS. ""​This win ​​allows us to begin ​working toward our future and expansion within Hamilton,"" he added. But while the companies' promises are sky-high, there have been some resistance to how they may change local landscapes. Critics have cautioned against allowing large bunker-style cannabis facilities to spring up across the greenbelt, arguing that they'll eat up precious farmland that should be used to grow food. ""It definitely presents a threat to local agriculture,"" ward 3 councillor Matthew Green said. He wants the producers to be classified as industrial or commercial facilities so that they will be on the hook for higher property taxes. Unless the change is made, ""there would be no incentives for local farmers to grow anything other than weed,"" he warned. ""The money is just too big."" Licensed pot production factories are currently classified as agricultural, Green says. And that means ""they get away with paying the minimum,"" he added. The city councillor wants the provincial government to take the initiative and address the issue. But in the meantime, come Oct. 17, these licensed producers — including Burlington's Maricann Group Inc and Emblem Corp. in Paris, Ont. — will deliver their products to the Ontario Cannabis store warehouse to be distributed by the government-run company.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,On Money: How the Avocado Became the Fruit of Global Trade,Appetite for “green gold” has grown so strong that neither organized crime nor tariffs are likely to slow its conquest.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/magazine/the-fruit-of-global-trade-in-one-fruit-the-avocado.html,2018-03-27T09:00:07Z,"Donald Trump has often railed at Nafta as “the worst trade deal ever.” But his focus on the loss of United States manufacturing jobs — felt keenly in the auto and textile industries — misses one of Nafta’s far-reaching benefits: the huge lift it has given to agricultural trade and consumer satisfaction in all three countries. Under Nafta, avocados have led an influx of year-round Mexican produce that has filled the seasonal voids in United States grocery stores and changed the way Americans eat. The avocado boom has caused environmental damage — some of Michoacán’s pine forests have been thinned out for avocado orchards — but it has been good for Americans gorging on guacamole in wintertime and Mexican farmers fending off the urge to join the drug trade or immigrate to the United States. According to a 2016 study commissioned by a marketing group for buyers and producers of Mexican avocados, the avocado supply chain has also created nearly 19,000 jobs in the United States and added more than $2.2 billion to the gross national product. Even California growers, once vociferous opponents of Mexican imports, are happy with the situation. Land and water are too scarce to expand their seasonal harvests — which are around 10 percent of Mexico’s annual production — but surging demand and prices have buoyed their businesses, too. “Avocados are Nafta’s shining star,” says Monica Ganley, an expert on Latin American trade and the founder of Quarterra, a consulting firm based in Buenos Aires. “But it’s important to remember that the benefits flow in both directions.” Under Nafta, United States agricultural exports to Mexico have expanded nearly fivefold, to $18 billion, with sales of American corn, soybeans and dairy products booming south of the border. “Trade is a multiplier, not a zero-sum game,” Ganley says. “We tend to overstate how much Mexico is dependent on the U.S. But American producers may have more to lose than Mexican producers if Nafta disappears.” Trump hasn’t killed Nafta yet. But as negotiations over a revamped agreement head into their eighth round, a trade war looms. The United States decision last month to impose steel and aluminum tariffs on most countries hangs over the talks, as do the planned trade sanctions against China. Trump offered temporary exemptions to Canada and Mexico, but only with the proviso that they remake Nafta to his liking. Even within the talks, avocado growers in Mexico and California worry that new anti-dumping duties proposed by the United States side could lead to a tit-for-tat retaliation that would harm both sides. “Once it starts,” Barnard asks, “where does it end?” So long as global demand keeps growing, though, the avocado seems almost impervious to upheaval at home and abroad. The violence in Michoacán, for example, has not curtailed the avocado industry’s goal of increasing exports to the United States by 15 percent this year. Nor would new tariffs necessarily stop Mexican avocado imports: The United States can’t sate its appetite for avocados elsewhere (no other producer is big enough), and the Mexicans have no other market so big and so near. The price of guacamole and avocado toast would go up again, but consumers already showed last year, during a spike in prices, that they might be willing to pay more. The bigger effect might be that avocado producers heighten their efforts in other developing markets, especially the one with most potential: China. When I lived in Shanghai, I often bicycled to an open-air grocery store run by a woman everybody knew simply as the avocado lady. She was one of the first grocers in the city to carry what is known in Chinese as “butter fruit,” though her clients were mostly grateful expatriates like me or Chinese returning from abroad. Even on days of heavy storms or bitter cold, this hardy entrepreneur was always in her shop before dawn, wearing rubber boots and tallying prices with a pencil. I never learned her name, but last year, in an unnecessary bit of marketing, she hung a crudely painted sign — “The Avocado Lady” — in front of her store. Photo Credit Illustration by Andrew Rae A decade ago, avocados were virtually unknown in China. The country imported only two tons in 2010; last year, it brought in 32,100 tons. The trend accelerated in 2017 when KFC ran an ad campaign for its avocado wraps called “Green Is Going Red” (to be hot, that is). It featured a pop star sporting an avocado mustache. The wraps didn’t sell so well, but the ads made avocados cool for China’s millennials. Mexico was China’s largest supplier of avocados until last year, when it was surpassed by Chile. (Peru is moving in quickly, too.) In the future, the competition may come from China itself. With state backing, some Chinese businessmen are developing avocado plantations in the southern province of Guangxi. If they can come up with an avocado that matches the Latin American variety, at a lower cost, then the global market could shift. For now, though, China is adjusting. Most avocados sold there are hard and green — often to the confusion of the uninitiated. To solve this problem, Barnard’s Mission Produce built China’s first “ripe center” in Shanghai last year, with another to follow in Shenzhen next year. And Barnard is dreaming big. “If I could put four avocado chunks in every bowl of noodle soup in China,” he muses, “we wouldn’t have enough avocados in the world.” Only Mexican production would come close. And who knows? If American trade policy lurches toward a trade war, the farmers under the volcanoes in Michoacán might be eager to start sending their harvests to China instead.

Extremely low temperatures have also kept bees in their hives, instead of on the job pollinating. “Not only are we losing crops, but bees aren’t flying,” Mr. Jacobsen said, adding, “The bees make your crop.” Subfreezing temperatures are more likely to impact California agriculture in December and January, when the citrus harvest is underway. Temperatures plunged to the 20s only briefly around Christmas last year, sparing this season’s production. Half of the navel orange and mandarin crop is still on trees, but citrus industry officials said they were not worried. Smaller almond and stone-fruit crops could push up prices for consumers. “We’re casting a wary eye on the forecast,” Mr. Chandler, the grower, said. “If Mother Nature keeps going cold, there’s not much that worrying is going to do to save the crop.” California Online (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)

3,"Across Midwest, Farmers Warn of G.O.P. Losses Over Trump’s Trade Policy",William Hejl of North Dakota is among the many Midwestern farmers in both political parties who are alarmed by the threat of Chinese tariffs on American agriculture and think Republicans could pay a political price.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/18/us/politics/trump-tariffs-china-soybeans-midterms.html,2018-04-18T23:05:15Z,"By proposing the tariffs, Mr. Trump has moved to fulfill a central promise of his campaign: confronting those countries he believes are undermining American industry. Yet his goal — to revive the steel and aluminum industries, thereby aiding the Rust Belt states that were crucial to his election — has effectively prioritized one element of the Trump political coalition over another, larger bloc of voters. That larger segment, the farm belt, is essential to Republican success in the midterm elections and beyond. Photo President Trump’s tariffs may prove to be a political gift to Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota, who won her seat by fewer than 3,000 votes in 2012. Credit J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press From the still-thawing soybean fields of North Dakota and Kansas to the corn and pork farms of Iowa, voters across the political spectrum say the president’s attacks on American economic rivals could do grave damage to an already unstable commodities market. “They’re not in touch with the reality of the Midwest and the impact that the tariffs would have,” said Bart Bergquist, a biology professor and part-time farmer who lives on 10 acres just south of Waterloo, Iowa. Mr. Bergquist, who voted for Mr. Trump in the 2016 election, added that commodities prices had already taken a toll on the area. “I know my neighbors are not rolling in money — they’re trying to supplement whatever else they can do to keep going,” he said. Representative Rod Blum, a Republican, represents much of eastern Iowa and is facing a highly competitive race in what is the second-largest soybean-producing congressional district in the country. He and other politicians are facing a “nervous” farm community across the state, according to Grant Young, an Iowa-based Republican strategist. “I listen to the farm show over the noon hour on WHO daily,” Mr. Young said of Iowa’s leading radio station. “They are usually a happy-go-lucky bunch promoting industry and holding a two-hour infomercial for the Farm Bureau. But the last couple of months I’m wondering if they need to take the sharp objects out of the studio.” In Kansas, Bob Henry, who grows corn and soybeans in another up-for-grabs House district near the Nebraska border, said the country could ill afford to tangle with a market that American farmers rely on. “For the United States soybean grower, China is the 800-pound gorilla in the room,” Mr. Henry said. He suggested that Beijing is exacting political payback against the Republican heartland: “China knows who got Trump elected.” After an initial round of tariffs on a modest share of American exports, the Chinese have displayed a more keen awareness of the electoral map and moved to punish those industries whose misfortune will be felt most intensely in states and districts pivotal in 2018. Karl Rove, the former strategist to President George W. Bush, said a trade clash “would limit Midwestern enthusiasm from our base and limit our ability to hold what we have and pick up more seats.” Mr. Rove also grumbled that Mr. Trump “has little to no understanding of the farm coalition.” He may have a slightly better appreciation after a meeting last week in the West Wing with a small group of farm belt Republican senators and governors, during which two of them brought up the adverse impact that tariffs on exports could have in the midterm election, according to officials briefed on the conversation. Mr. Trump used the session to direct a pair of his top economic advisers to reconsider whether the United States should join a free-trade pact with a group of Pacific nations. But just hours later he signaled on Twitter that he was unlikely to reverse course on that agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Instead, there are already whispers, in Washington and in agriculture states, that the president is risking a replay of President Jimmy Carter’s grain embargo on the Soviets, which contributed to the massive losses Democrats suffered in 1980. Indeed, after a year of seeing Mr. Trump only muse about pulling out of Nafta and being stymied by Congress in his attempt to slash the Agriculture Department’s budget, there is now a sense in the farm belt that Mr. Trump’s yearning to punish China could inflict real economic and political damage on his own political base. “This is the first time it’s in your face, especially to us in the Midwest,” said Ed Schafer, a Republican former governor of North Dakota who was agriculture secretary under George W. Bush. There may be no other race in America that is at once as significant as the Senate contest here and as shaped by whether China’s tariffs take effect this year. Most of North Dakota’s votes are in the eastern end of the state, in the Red River valley. — a region that also happens to be home to the three largest soybean-producing counties in the nation. Senator Heitkamp won her seat by fewer than 3,000 votes in 2012. She remains personally popular, a valuable asset in a state with just 570,000 voters, but North Dakota has turned sharply away from Democrats in recent years. But Mr. Trump has now handed her what may be a political gift. “Senator Heitkamp will jump on the big, bad Trump and the stupid policy that’s coming out of Washington hurting our farmers,” Mr. Schafer said. “That’s a strong message in North Dakota.” Or as Rob Port, a conservative talk radio host and columnist in the state, put it: “This is the perfect issue for her. Her base eats up the Trump bashing, but it’s also an economic argument that’ll have rural Trump voters saying, ‘Maybe blind allegiance to Trump isn’t such a good thing.’” Ms. Heitkamp is already testing out such a message against her rival, Mr. Cramer. “Clearly he sees his role is to be a vote for President Trump in the United States Senate,” she said. “And I believe my role is to be a vote for North Dakota in the United States Senate.” Mr. Cramer, who Mr. Trump repeatedly wooed to run for the Senate, accused his opponent of “hysteria” and said she was overstating what are at this point only trade negotiations. Photo Representative Kevin Cramer, a Republican, was wooed by President Trump to challenge Ms. Heitkamp for her Senate seat. Credit Charles Rex Arbogast/Associated Press “People in North Dakota prefer humility to hyperbole, and that kind of hyperbole I don’t think sells very well politically,” he said. “But it’s certainly not good for our farmers or good for our economy.” But on a local talk radio program, Mr. Cramer let slip his frustration with the president’s actions. “He tends to have rather emotional responses,” he said of Mr. Trump. North Dakota is not simply another red state where Democrats are bound for extinction. There is an enduring populist streak here, dating back to its mistrust of distant bankers and millers in Minneapolis, Chicago and New York. To this day, the state retains a state-controlled bank and mill. “We’re Republicans until it comes to subsidies for farmers,” said George Blank, only half-jokingly, as he sipped coffee with a half dozen fellow retirees at their daily breakfast-and-bull session in Casselton’s Country Kitchen. And, Mr. Blank noted, “everything drives on ag in this state.” Recalling his years running a construction supply business in a state where one in four jobs is agriculture-related, he said: “When the price of corn went down that impacted us greatly.” Now, though, soybeans have become the go-to commodity, said Vanessa Kummer, who farms 4,000 acres with her husband and son near Colfax, N.D. “It has become our cash crop and the most reliable crop to go to,” she said. Nancy Johnson, who leads the North Dakota Soybean Growers Association, reached for a measure of cheery, upper-Midwest optimism as she expressed hope that the threat of tariffs was merely “a negotiating tactic” by Mr. Trump. But Ms. Johnson, who wears a soybean pendant necklace, said her farmers “are rightly concerned, because we’re being used as a weapon.” Over on William Hejl’s farm in Amenia, N.D., just north of Casselton and part of the 86 percent of the state that is made up of farmland and ranches, the anxiety is as difficult to miss as the April snow crunching underfoot. Photo Agriculture-dependent states like North Dakota went strongly for President Trump in 2016, but voters are also keenly concerned about trade. Casselton, N.D., is in the county that produces more soybeans than any other in the United States. Credit Dan Koeck for The New York Times Showing a visitor his gleaming, green John Deere tractor, still in its shed for winter, Mr. Hejl said to “check back in August” — and not just to find better weather. “If this thing hasn’t been resolved, that’s when it’s going to hurt,” he said of the outset of harvesting. “You’ve got to pay for the fuel and for the people to drive the combine.” Kevin Skunes, a neighboring farmer who is also president of the National Corn Growers Association, joined Mr. Hejl and a visiting reporter for coffee, a brownie and a chance to sound the alarm. “In an already depressed farm economy, if we take another hit on soybeans and corn it’s going to be disastrous,” Mr. Skunes said. Back outside the post office in Casselton, Mr. Runck found his voice nearly drowned out by the sound of the speeding Burlington Northern Santa Fe — the same freight train that will be carrying crops west to the Pacific this fall. But his answer carried clearly when he was asked whether he would support Ms. Heitkamp or Mr. Cramer: “I think the president has got to do the right thing between now and the election.” Mitch Smith contributed reporting from Kansas, Ann Hinga Klein from Iowa, Meg Lindholm from North Dakota and Natalie Kitroeff from New York.

4,"Green Crack, Blue Dream, Gorilla Glue: The problem of pricing pot","NEW YORK (Reuters) - In 2014, as Jonathan Rubin and Ian Laird considered investing in the booming U.S. cannabis industry, they hit a problem: How to value pot starts-ups with little verified data on the price of the weed itself?",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-marijuana-prices/green-crack-blue-dream-gorilla-glue-the-problem-of-pricing-pot-idUSKCN1GR1ER,2018-03-15T11:07:05Z,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - In 2014, as Jonathan Rubin and Ian Laird considered investing in the booming U.S. cannabis industry, they hit a problem: How to value pot starts-ups with little verified data on the price of the weed itself? FILE PHOTO: Employees prepare recreational marijuana orders for customers at the MedMen store in West Hollywood, California, U.S., January 2, 2018. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo While a smoker may know the going retail price for “Strawberry Diesel” or “Buddha’s Sister”, the sector’s wholesale tier still operates much like a black market because of ongoing federal prohibition, despite legalizations in 30 U.S. states and Washington D.C. since the 1990s. That left Rubin and Laird puzzled on the investment value of a dispensary, a weed farm or a factory making pot-infused candy. The problem spawned a different investment: The founding of New Leaf Data Services LLC, a Stamford, Conn.-based wholesale price data service that fields reporters to take on the steep challenge of cataloguing going rates. Started three years ago, New Leaf now publishes weekly benchmark spot prices and forecasts on wholesale indoor-, outdoor-, and greenhouse-grown marijuana for 17 regions with legalization laws. New Leaf makes money from about 350 pot proprietors and other subscribers who buy reports and custom analytics. It has raised money from investors who want exposure to the cannabis sector without the risk of breaking federal law. The model is roughly based on S&amp;P Global Platts, a firm where Rubin once worked that researches and publishes wholesale prices for crude oil, fuel and other commodities such as metals or agricultural crops. The task is much harder for pot, and New Leaf’s experience stalking prices sheds light on the murky trade of what might be the fastest-growing U.S. commodity, sold legally and illegally for untold billions of dollars. Cannabis firms still deal almost exclusively in cash to avoid a paper trail or because they have almost no access to banks and financial services. Because it’s illegal to transport the drug across state lines, prices and available products vary widely in different regions based on whether a state has both medical and recreational markets and the number of licensed dispensaries and producers. Last week, spot prices for flower in Alaska were $5,496 per lb, while prices in Colorado and Oregon fell to historic lows of $1,008 and $1,166, respectively, according to New Leaf. (For a graphic on state marijuana laws and price differences, see: tmsnrt.rs/2AFalvZ ) Legal pot prices are also impacted by supply and demand fluctuations in the illegal market, and the spread between the two can vary. In California, regulated market prices are more than $1,000 per lb, whereas prices for illegal weed can be as low as $500 per lb, estimated Scott Davies, a California cultivator. Legal market marijuana tends to be more expensive because supplies are more restricted and because it is taxed. “Consider each state to be a different country when it comes to their laws, amount of licenses issued, what the qualifying conditions are for entry into their medical program, as well as what the political climate and current illicit market looks like,” said Nic Easley, one of New Leaf’s market consultants. Easley, a disabled veteran of the U.S. Air Force, said he moved to Colorado in 2006 to use cannabis to ease the pain of injuries. He’s one of New Leaf’s team of a dozen price experts who chase down their market data and intelligence through a network of commercial players and cannabis industry groups, such as the Oregon Retailers of Cannabis Association (ORCA). The data suppliers agree to submit weekly prices anonymously and, in exchange, get discounted subscriptions or other services. LEGAL BUT UNDERGROUND A multi-billion dollar cannabis industry has developed despite federal prohibition, but many executives, farmers and employees are still wary of federal prosecution. Davies, a farmer in Humboldt County, California - a region renowned for its premium cannabis – said growers have historically done and still do handshake deals with counterparts vouched for by shared acquaintances. Davies sells directly to dispensaries, essentially relying on the rumor mill to set prices. “It’s all been word-of-mouth, through people we know and trust who are established players,” he said. But the market in California - which recently legalized recreational use - is evolving rapidly and becoming more like a traditional industry, with buyers and sellers now sometimes meeting at industry events, Davies said. Market transparency has seen a boost from heightened regulations as authorities in states like Oregon rolled out legal recreational markets, said Casey Houlihan, head of ORCA. Under the new rules in that state, dispensaries must purchase cannabis from registered producers, who are required to track their sales and report them to the government. Previously, dispensaries could buy more liberally through a medical marijuana program. The data New Leaf collects is still fairly rough, and the marijuana market has nothing like national benchmark prices or futures contracts common to other legal commodities trades. There’s no real way for businesses to hedge, and price-setting remains largely guesswork, said Josh Richman, senior vice president of sales and marketing for Franklin BioScience, which grows cannabis and manufactures branded products, such as mints, in Colorado, Nevada and Pennsylvania. “There isn’t something where I can sell long or short,” he said. GRAPHIC: U.S. legalization legislation and regional pot prices - tmsnrt.rs/2AFalvZ BLUE DREAM, GREEN CRACK AND GORILLA GLUE The retail market is somewhat more transparent, and a pricing service called BDS Analytics runs an online database of more than 140,000 types of pot and pot products. BDS sells pricing and popularity data to retail shop owners. Roy Bingham, who co-founded BDS Analytics in 2015, is a veteran of the finance and consultancy industries. “We knew this data is really invaluable for the retail business,” Bingham said. “There are people in this industry who have been in supply chains at Walmart, GNC and other mainstream operations.” His firm collects point-of-sales data from retailers and lists the details for products such as “Blue Dream” and “Green Crack”. Joseph Hopkins, co-owner of a dispensary called The Greener Side in Eugene, Oregon, uses the data to deal with suppliers. “When vendors come in and say they have x, y, z products, I can go back and look at whatever the going rate is for that product,” he said. Still, the metrics are imperfect. State regulators increasingly perform quality tests to ensure safety, but no one checks to make sure that what someone is selling as “Green Crack” really matches weed branded under the same name elsewhere. The data show variations in demand for various brand among regions. For example, Blue Dream has reigned as the most popular strain for flower in Colorado and Washington since 2014. But in Oregon, tokers favor a strain known as GG - formerly “Gorilla Glue,” until its purveyors got sued by the makers of the actual glue by the same name.

5,Legal marijuana arriving in California after decades of underground dealing,Adults will be allowed to buy up to an ounce of marijuana from licensed stores — generating millions in new tax dollars,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/12/28/legal-marijuana-arriving-california-after-decades-underground-dealing/975323001/,2017-12-28T11:00:03Z,"Marijuana at Joy of Life Wellness Center in Palm Springs (Photo: Lance Gerber/DESERT magazine) A new gold rush is sweeping California as the state prepares to launch legal marijuana sales Monday, bringing the powerful and largely underground economy finally into public view. Marijuana has long been one of California’s most important cash crops, albeit one many visitors would never see amid the vineyards and avocado farms. Now, tens of thousands of entrepreneurs are rushing to carve out a slice of an about-to-be-legal market that has grass-growing cannabis evangelists colliding with out-of-state suits eager to make a now-legal buck. And there's a lot to be made: The state's existing marijuana black market is worth $13.5 billion, according to cannabis financial analysis firm GreenWave Advisors, while the legal market could be worth $5.1 billion in 2018. More: Marijuana's legalization fuels black market in other states “You’re taking an industry that was completely underground and making it the most regulated product of all time,” said Jessica Lilga, who runs a medical cannabis distribution service in Oakland, Calif., and hopes to expand into recreational pot. “It’s just insane.” Legalization through voter approval of Prop. 64, which created a system for legally growing and selling cannabis, also raises concerns about whether kids will start using more marijuana thanks to increased visibility and whether the state is creating a new Big Tobacco industry that puts profits ahead of public health. Marijuana plants at PSA Organica in Palm Springs (Photo: Lance Gerber/DESERT magazine) While five other states already offer legal marijuana sales, the Golden State’s sheer size is expected to reshape the pot industry worldwide, potentially driving down prices for consumers while generating hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. It also holds the promise of wiping out criminal records for some people with previous cannabis convictions and helping longtime illegal drug dealers go legal by getting them licensed. Eight states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana, but only Colorado, Oregon, Nevada, Alaska and Washington have functioning marketplaces. Massachusetts and Maine expect to begin sales sometime later next year. Marijuana remains illegal at the federal level, but the Trump administration has made no high-profile moves against any state where pot is openly sold to adults. Marijuana at Desert's Finest in Desert Hot Springs (Photo: Lance Gerber/DESERT magazine) That has store owners scrambling to erect billboards near Los Angeles International Airport and flooding bars with street marketers. California rules limit marijuana advertising, so dispensaries are getting creative in how they reach potential customers. Med Men, which sells medical cannabis but hopes to offer recreational pot come Monday, is wrapping 30 trucks with advertisements for its four existing high-end dispensaries. Cannabis firm American Green even bought an entire town — Nipton, Calif. — to create a marijuana mecca. Because California’s marijuana law requires all cannabis to arrive in stores pre-packaged, growers and distributers are frantically developing branding and packaging to set their wares apart. “You’re seeing a lot more sophisticated people from other industries starting to move into the space,” said B.J. Carretta, Med Men’s chief marketing officer. “If traffic doubles in January, it can’t be amateur hour.” California’s marijuana growers are already highly sophisticated when it comes to operating illegal farms in the mountains of the Emerald Triangle north of San Francisco. But playing by these new rules is a different proposition. California’s pot regulations require a variety of water and environmental considerations, along with tight accounting and tracking. More: California's illegal marijuana farms force cops to wield 'green' stick Many longtime cannabis farmers are struggling with whether to go legal, in part because getting licensed can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Additionally, many longtime marijuana moonshiners are culturally opposed to playing by the rules. For generations, they have secretly grown vast quantities of pot destined for black-market users across America. Clear containers allow customers to see and smell the 20 strains of marijuana offered at the MedMen marijuana dispensary on Santa Monica Blvd in West Hollywood. Tablets offer addition information.

(Photo: Richard Lui/The Desert Sun) Matt Karnes of GreenWave Advisors estimates at least half of all the cannabis grown in California is illegally shipped across state lines and sold at two or even three times the price it would fetch if sold locally as medical marijuana. Those growers have an extensive network of distributors built through mutual trust over decades of underground dealing. “What we are going to see is not only a legal shift but a cultural shift,” said Michael Steinmetz, the CEO of cannabis distribution company Flow Kana. Steinmetz bought an abandoned vineyard and winery in Mendocino County to serve as a centralized processing marijuana center for small growers. He envisions dozens of farmers pooling their crops to be trimmed, packaged and distributed as a premium umbrella brand. “Commodity cannabis is going to be a race to the bottom. We want to be more like wine and less like wheat,” he said. A worker at Harborside Health Center in Oakland, Calif., packages marijuana cigarettes -- joints -- for customers.

(Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY) Like other states that have legalized recreational marijuana, California is creating a network of privately owned but tightly regulated pot shops that will offer shoppers a wide variety of products, from the smokeable “flower” most people are familiar with to cannabis-infused foods called edibles, and increasingly popular marijuana extracts used for vaping. The state requires quality testing and will regulate the kinds of pesticides and other chemicals used in growing. “Consumers at large haven’t seen that,” Steinmetz said. “In the black market, you buy whatever the dealer has and you want him out of your house as soon as possible.” Lilga said she expects to see retail prices drop as newly formed cannabis conglomerates use their size to price out smaller players. While there's a state tax on marijuana, the government isn't regulating how much consumers will pay, leaving that largely up to the free market. “There’s a lot of culture and community and soul being sucked out,” she said. “We see that inevitably that a lot of people will not survive the next year.” 'Budtender' Jason Coleman describes the effects of a marijuana-infused lubricant to customers inside the Medicine Man cannabis dispensary in Denver on April 19, 2017.

(Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY) Steve DeAngelo, one of California’s best-known medical marijuana business owners and advocates, said he worries the new regulations will artificially limit the supply early next year, potentially driving up prices. “Cannabis consumers deserve the same choices enjoyed by shoppers at the grocery store. While everybody would like to be able to afford heirloom tomatoes, meticulously tended in small patches and selling for $5.99 a pound — most families can’t afford them,” said DeAngelo, the CEO of Oakland-based Harborside cannabis dispensary. “Most can only afford the lower-priced tomatoes grown by larger, more efficient farms. And thankfully for these consumers, regulations allow the existence of such tomato farms.” A box of joints awaits customers at Harborside Health Center in Oakland, Calif. (Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY) Still, the state faces major challenges in the coming months, said Kevin Sabet, the director of the anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, which warns that California's legalization of marijuana is creating a new Big Tobacco industry because many Americans don’t see the broader consequences of widespread cannabis cultivation and consumption. Data about how legalization has affected cannabis use rates, particularly among kids, remains consistently unreliable. Marijuana remains entirely illegal at the federal level, most banks refuse to handle cannabis cash and employers are struggling with how to handle routine drug testing for workers in states where pot is legal. More: Recreational pot is coming to California. Here's a map of dispensaries in the Coachella Valley Knowing those challenges, Sabet said California should have taken more time to work out the kinks. “Prop. 64 was written with this expedited timeline because the industry was its main author. And the industry only makes money if things are rolled out quickly, without much thought about the actual way this will operate. California is not ready for recreational legalization,” Sabet said. “The only people who will benefit from this rollout are the Silicon Valley billionaires who have invested in this whole thing.” Silicon Valley billionaires heavily backed Prop. 64, particularly Napster co-founder and former Facebook president Sean Parker, who donated more than $1 million to the November 2016 ballot measure. Some industry experts say they believe venture capitalists hope to commoditize cannabis production and create a legitimate cash crop. “We’re going to have more Budweiser than craft brewers,” said Lilga, the distributor. “I can tell you it’s not fun at all. This is the epitome of the corporate model.” That corporate model is expected to generate hefty tax returns for the state: $300-$500 million in marijuana taxes in the first year, according to cannabis analytics firm New Frontier Data. That estimate doesn’t include local sales taxes and depends heavily on how quickly the industry ramps up. Former California Attorney General Bill Lockyer counts himself as both a responsible member of the community and someone who thinks legal cannabis can be done right. Lockyer, who was in office as medical marijuana became widespread in California, said he thinks the new recreational pot regulations are far better than the state's original medical marijuana rules — so much that he's co-founding a marijuana distribution company with colleagues drawn from the brewing and alcohol-distribution fields. “This is the right thing for California, and we’re trying to do it in a legal and smart way,” he said. “If it winds up helping pay for my kids’ college education, I won’t complain about that.” Jars of legal recreational marijuana sit on the shelf of a Denver pot shop. A new study says nearly 60% of Americans now support marijuana legalization.

Though setting up a pot shop has always been an uncertain business, memos issued by the Department of Justice under President Obama gave people in the industry some assurance that if they were abiding by state laws, they were at small risk of federal prosecution. But on Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded those memos, allowing federal prosecutors to enforce federal marijuana laws more aggressively and sending ripples of unease throughout the burgeoning industry. “A lot of folks in the business and broader society didn’t realize how tenuous the Obama Administration’s safe space was,” says the California Growers Association’s Hezekiah Allen, who represents hundreds of cannabis farmers in a state where recreational pot went on sale for the first time just four days ago. As more states have legalized marijuana and more people have publicly set up marijuana businesses, Allen says, “there is much more exposure to risk than there ever has been.” Nearly 30 states have legalized medical marijuana. Eight states — which represent about a quarter of America’s population — have legalized recreational marijuana, allowing adults to consume it much like they consume alcohol. But cannabis remains a dangerous drug in the eyes of the federal government. Sessions himself has said the substance is “not the kind of thing that ought to be legalized.” And in announcing the changes, the Justice Department emphasized in a press release that there would be “a return to the rule of law.” Yet the disconnect between federal and state laws on the issue remains unchanged. Sam Kamin, a marijuana law expert at the University of Denver, says that the changes may essentially give U.S. attorneys around the country “unfettered discretion” to bring cases, but that “it’s not clear how those U.S. attorneys would exercise that discretion.” Michael Vitiello, a criminal law expert at the University of the Pacific, emphasizes that Justice Department resources remain limited and believes that issues like immigration and opioid misuse will remain higher priorities. “Right now, it’s chaotic,” Vitiello says of marijuana markets, “and this just adds a lot more uncertainty.” California is still getting its recreational market up and running, and Allen says that some cannabis growers are suddenly reconsidering their applications for state licenses — thinking that staying in the gray or black markets might be the safer course after all. Even if vigorous enforcement and raids never materialize, the Justice Department changes are likely going to slow investment in the so-called “green rush” and dissuade some people from setting up new marijuana businesses. “Investments are less secure,” says Vitiello. “They were insecure anyway, but potential forfeiture of assets and criminal prosecutions all make legitimate business more difficult.” When cannabis producers exit the black market and do all the paperwork required to participate in legal state markets, he adds, “what they’re saying is ‘Here I am.'” And while federal drug enforcement agents might be in limited supply, it takes few resources to send chilling cease-and-desist letters, he says. Recreational marijuana may be more at risk than medical marijuana. For the last several years, a federal budget provision has prevented the Justice Department from using funds to disrupt medical marijuana markets that have been legalized by states. As Congress inches toward passing a budget for 2018, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle are pushing for that provision to be renewed. And some advocates for marijuana reform believe that rescinding the memos may actually make it easier for their side to win support. “It is a galvanizing moment,” says Grant Smith of the Drug Policy Alliance. On a conference call Thursday afternoon, several members of the congressional Cannabis Caucus criticized the move by Sessions and argued that the changes only underscore the need for reform at the federal level that will clearly leave this issue up to states and local governments. The lawmakers said that people rely on medical marijuana to treat debilitating conditions, and that tens of thousands of individuals now rely on legal sales of cannabis to make a living. “We’re not going to allow the clock to be turned back,” said California Rep. Barbara Lee, noting that minorities have been disproportionately affected by the enforcement of drug laws. Also on the call was Colorado Rep. Jared Polis, who has introduced a provision that would also prohibit Justice Department funds from being used to disrupt recreational markets. So far, the measure has found little traction in a Republican-controlled Congress. Working against broad reform are advocacy groups that oppose legalization, like Smart Approaches to Marijuana. On Thursday, their leader Kevin Sabet applauded Justice Department’s decision, telling the New York Times that “It puts the industry on notice in these states who thought they had cover from the states and the feds.” The law firm of Vicente Sederberg, which counsels clients who run marijuana businesses in Colorado, was fielding calls on Thursday from people wondering about what might come next. Mason Tvert, who has long advocated for the reform of marijuana laws and handles media relations for the firm, says they have been emphasizing that “it remains to be seen if there will actually be any changes in enforcement.” The changes are causing confusion, he says, “ but we don’t expect to see any full-blown rollback of the system.” Lawmakers from states that have legalized the substance have suggested that a crackdown could prove unpopular, going against the decisions of voters in places from Oregon to Nevada. “With no prior notice to Congress, the Justice Department has trampled on the will of the voters in [Colorado] and other states,” Republican Sen. Cory Gardner said in a tweet condemning Sessions’ move. Support for legalization has been growing in recent years, reaching a record high of 64% in October, according to Gallup. Last year was the first time that a majority of Republicans — 51% — expressed approval. The potential for profits may also prove to be a buffer, especially under an administration that is resoundingly pro-business. While Sessions has criticized legalization, as has Trump’s chief of staff John Kelly, the President has said previously that the issue should be left to the states. “Remember that the money is not red money or blue money,” Vitiello says of investments in the space. “It is green money.” If nothing else, Sessions has issued a strong reminder that marijuana remains controversial, even if the first sales of recreational marijuana in California were met with a rather blase attitude on New Year’s Day. Laws such as the Controlled Substances Act, the Attorney General said in his memo, “reflect Congress’ determination that marijuana is a dangerous drug and that marijuana activity is a serious crime.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,Material Culture: The Enduring Appeal of: Baskets,"Baskets, clockwise from left: Bonnie Gale, Willow Artist, bonniegale.com; Adrian Charlton, norfolkbaskets.co.uk; Dominic Parrette of Sussex Willow, sussexwillow.co.uk; Vannerie de Villaines France, vannerie.com; Annemarie O’Sullivan, annemarieosullivan.co.uk;…",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/t-magazine/design/basket-weaving.html,2018-02-15T17:09:47Z,"The variety of baskets in the world — with their distinct shapes and materials and techniques and uses — is endless. In the way that history can be told in words, so too can it be read through craft — objects ingeniously fashioned out of necessity from whatever was on hand. Almost any plant whose parts are pliable, or can be made so by soaking in water — including roots, vines, pine needles, grasses, stems, even trees — can be turned into a basket. Broad materials, such as palms in the tropics, are plaited like braids; narrow materials, such as grasses on the Savannah, are coiled like ceramic pots; while stiffer materials, such as willow in the lowlands, are woven like tapestry. Trade, migration and war have meant that techniques and styles spread and have often mingled. There is a beautiful spiral weave done in Burkina Faso that somehow made its way to the Dordogne in Southern France, where it was used for garden baskets. In South Carolina, the Gullah, descendants of slaves, made sweetgrass baskets using a coiling technique brought from West Africa by their ancestors. Photo Two different baskets, as depicted by the Irish painter Sampson Towgood Roch, circa 1824. Credit © National Museum Ni, Collection Ulster Museum Few places in the world, however, have as enormous a variety of basketry as England. Most are made of willow, a wonder material that is at once flexible, lightweight, strong, endlessly renewable and easy to cultivate. (Cut the tree to the ground and it will resprout; push a branch into the earth and it will take root.) In the way that Eskimos have 50 or so words for “snow,” the British have nearly 200 for their baskets. There were seven different types for the herring trade alone: for trapping, for sorting, for holding ice, and one, the quarter cran, made to precise government specifications as a measure for pricing. Each particular need — whether agricultural, industrial or domestic — would be resolved by a basket uniquely configured for the task. Well into the first half of the 20th century in Britain, there were wicker prams and mail carts; butcher delivery baskets (distinct from bakery baskets); carriers for messenger pigeons and ammunition drops; and containers for broadcasting seed and hauling brick. We tend to think of basketry as a rural endeavor, which it mostly was until the 1800s, when Britain began to rapidly urbanize. Industrialization, rather than signaling basketry’s demise, heralded a peak, as baskets were required to service the factories and towns. Basket-making became professionalized and specialized, with weavers — distinguished for the first time from growers, preparers, salespeople and repairmen — laboring side by side in workshops. This new breed of journeymen weaver underwent five to seven years of apprenticeship; each became proficient at many different baskets (sometimes over a thousand if you include all the variations). But during World War I, cheaper baskets imported from poorer countries, as well as wooden crates, were becoming more readily available; and by the 1960s, the English basketry industry collapsed under the weight of plastic. Of course, industry demands efficiency, but along with basketry’s diminishment comes the disappearance of the enormous breadth of knowledge embodied in those weavers. Just two of the men (they were all men) who trained under that 19th-century system — Colin Manthorpe, 80, and Terry Bensley, 79 — are still alive. They are sought out by some of today’s best makers, such as Adrian Charlton and Hilary Burns. The Devon-based Burns recalls that observing Manthorpe weave a herring cran was like “watching a dance; there was no wasted movement.” Despite the loss of this know-how, what had already vanished long before was something more profound, namely, the connection of a maker to his landscape, and the life that entails. Photo Three of O’Sullivan’s baskets. Credit Sophia Spring AFTER THE LEAVES drop from the willow, in January and February, O’Sullivan and McWalter, along with a few friends who have come to love these yearly outings, head into the cold, wet field to harvest the rods with secateurs, or pruning shears. It is physically demanding work, both the cutting and the stacking, as well as the carrying of the heavy bundles, and yet “it is easy to sound nostalgic,” O’Sullivan says. “There is this gentle connection to the land — and to one another. In the midst of the drudgery, which it is, you look up at blue sky or birds or you have a cup of tea. You pass each other and have an intense conversation for 15 minutes, and then you drift apart, and after a while you lose each other completely in the tall willow, and then you find your way back to one another.” Between March and May, the willow is sorted by variety and size and left to dry. On the short path between kitchen door and studio is the open shed where these satisfyingly neat bundles of willow — yellow, lime green, mocha, black — are leaning. After soaking the reeds for a day or two, O’Sullivan begins her work on the floor, using her knee or foot to hold the rods in places as she creates a base. Pushing long pieces in all around it, each of which she scores with a knife and bends upright to form the structure, she builds every basket stick by stick. O’Sullivan’s decision to fashion her life in this way is a choice that a country basket-maker in the past would not have had the luxury of making. Steeped as her work is in tradition, it is driven by her design sensibility (she invents her own forms), and her desire to live lightly on the land in an increasingly imperiled environment. A basket’s perishability is part of its beauty — it will last a few lifetimes before disappearing back into the ground. Until then, “I want these baskets to become part of people’s lives, to get battered, to be polished by their hands,” she says, “and to have crumbs and bits of wood in the bottom of them.” A version of this article appears in print on February 18, 2018, on Page M2170 of T Magazine with the headline: Baskets.

8,"Seeds Only a Plant Breeder Could Love, Until Now","Row 7 Seed Company aims to connect plant breeders with restaurant chefs as they develop new varieties of vegetables, in some cases sending chefs a range of trials to taste test, as with this squash.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/dining/row-7-seed-company-dan-barber.html,2018-02-27T10:00:48Z,"Plenty of companies, small and large, work with university plant breeders to distribute new seed varieties. But Row 7 aims to give breeders the chance to reach a large market with their most esoteric and groundbreaking work — by connecting them with chefs. Photo The company will sell seven varieties of seeds to start, both in small packets for home gardeners and in bulk for farmers. Credit Andrew White for The New York Times As they develop new varieties, plant breeders will kick around ideas with chefs across the country, using feedback from the kitchen to guide their research. While Row 7 will consider the needs of regional growers, its founders say that flavor will always come first. “Part of the goal of the company is not only to increase the flavor of vegetables: It’s to look at how we, as chefs, can change the culture of eating,” said Mr. Barber, who started Row 7 with the seedsman Matthew Goldfarb and the plant breeder Michael Mazourek. Starting Wednesday, Row 7 will sell organic seeds, developed in the United States, on its website, row7seeds.com. At first, it will sell seeds for the Badger Flame; three varieties of squash (including one that announces its ripeness on the vine by changing from dark green to a rusty orange); a small, creamy potato; a pleasingly bitter cucumber; and a floral-tasting habanero pepper without even a pinprick of heat. Row 7’s founders are betting that as plant breeders and chefs conspire to grow what’s most delicious, they will grab the attention of home gardeners and small- to mid-scale farmers, who can order the seed in bulk. Their new varieties may then pop up at farmers’ markets and high-end grocery stores, and, if demand is high enough, in national supermarket chains and manufactured foods. It sounds ambitious for a new company with such a small selection, not to mention one whose prices are high, from $3.50 for 100 seeds to $4.95 for just 12. But the founders have seen what happens when high-profile chefs flex their marketing muscles. EIGHT YEARS AGO, Mr. Barber asked Mr. Mazourek, an associate professor of plant breeding and genetics at Cornell University, if he could develop a better butternut squash. Mr. Mazourek had been working on what he calls “squash innovation” for many years, and came back to Mr. Barber with the Honeynut. Photo Row 7’s founders: From left, the plant breeder Michael Mazourek, the chef Dan Barber and the seedsman Matthew Goldfarb, outside Mr. Barber’s Blue Hill restaurant in Greenwich Village. Credit Andrew White for The New York Times Like all breeders, Mr. Mazourek had reached plenty of dead ends throughout his career. He didn’t see why this miniature squash should be any different, even if it was notably cute and tasty. But Mr. Barber pitched the new variety, calling it out by name at food conferences and cooking with it at his restaurants, where the servers tell diners detailed stories about ingredients. The squash elbowed its way beyond an elite dining scene, through more and more restaurant kitchens, from social media and articles in Vogue and Cooking Light, right into the aisles of national grocery chains and onto dinner tables across the country. In about five years, the Honeynut had risen from academic obscurity. (That’s fast for a squash.) “The Honeynut could not have happened without chefs,” Mr. Barber said. “They Instagrammed it, they talked about it, it was on their menus, and it went from zero to 60.” Mr. Barber, Mr. Mazourek and Mr. Goldfarb all wondered what might happen if more chefs had a say in which new seeds went to market — if they played a part in shaping their own food supply. Was it a freakish anomaly, or could the Honeynut effect be repeated over and over again? Could chefs create a demand for new varieties that were more experimental and interesting and diverse, more nutrient-dense and more thoroughly delicious, from root to stem to leaf? Mr. Mazourek’s colleagues — plant breeders with creative streaks, experts on the substance of cauliflower, corn and carrots — found all of these questions exciting. When Mr. Barber spoke to chefs, they were just as enthusiastic. Row 7’s partners brought in investors, including Walter Robb, a former chief executive of Whole Foods Market, and Adam Neumann, the chief executive of WeWork. Photo Mr. Mazourek developed the Robin’s Koginut Squash, a cross between two squash varieties that changes color on the vine when it’s ripe. Credit Andrew White for The New York Times Row 7’s seeds are not patented; the company’s founders say they don’t believe in patenting life, and want researchers to have access to information. “As the climate changes and pests and disease evolve, we have to keep up,” Mr. Mazourek said. For now, all profits from the seed sales will be used to support each plant breeder’s research. (Later, the model could look more like that of other seed companies, which pass only a portion of profits to breeders, or license out particular seeds for royalty fees.) Michael Sligh, the director of a sustainable agriculture program at Rural Advancement Foundation International, said that as the seed market has become more consolidated in the last two decades, there has been an alarming decline in the number of public plant-breeding programs. “So part of what we’re dealing with is, how do we reinvent this pipeline from seed development all the way into the marketplace and to the point of consumption?” he said. He has seen a flurry of what he calls participatory plant breeding, in which plant breeders, farmers and others collaborate to build new supply chains and address their own regional needs, such as the Bread Lab at Washington State University. Mr. Sligh said that a seed business with chefs in the picture had potential. “It’s a new and exciting linkage that would be cutting edge,” he said. “Chefs have great public access, which plant breeders and farmers don’t have so much.” Photo Irwin Goldman developed his beet, the Badger Flame, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he bred it to be colorful, sweet and only mildly earthy. Credit Andrew White for The New York Times WHEN MR. MAZOUREK FIRST ASKED the Boston chef Ana Sortun to imagine editing a vegetable, any vegetable she liked, Ms. Sortun was stumped. “Why would I want to change something in nature?” she said. “Nature is perfect.” But tasting some of Mr. Mazourek’s squash trials gave her a sense of the possibilities. “It had just never dawned on me that I could talk to a seed breeder and have a conversation like this,” said Ms. Sortun, who has served the Honeynut at her restaurants for years. She is one of dozens of chefs who plan to cook with Row 7’s new varieties as they’re available. They include Mashama Bailey, of the Grey in Savannah, Ga. Ms. Bailey was drawn to Mr. Mazourek’s work with another variety of squash, bred to have stems that taste too good to throw away. “I like the focus on utilizing the entire plant,” she said, “and on reducing waste.” Heirlooms, which are older varieties of open-pollinated plants, are prized for their origin stories and their flavors — though they can be risky for growers. The newer seeds that plant breeders produce, whether open-pollinated or hybrid, are manipulated to thrive, and aren’t idealized in the same way, except by the breeders. In interviews, some described the work as beautiful, as both an art and a science, practiced in the lab and the field. Mr. Goldman said that like many of his peers, he considered every plant to be imperfect and unfinished — a work-in-progress on a continuum that stretched all the way back to each plant’s domestication. Mr. Mazourek kept working on the Honeynut, even after its initial success, selecting for higher yields on the vine and longer storage. The palm-sized 898 squash is his latest version, and among Row 7’s first group of trial seeds. Every year or so, the company plans to release more seed varieties, and newer versions of previously sold seeds. But that’s not the only reason Mr. Goldman, who worked for more than a decade on his sunset-colored beet, continues to tinker on a new generation of the Badger Flame, even as the seed goes on sale. “It’s like a raising a kid,” he said. “You’re really never done.” Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

9,How to grow marijuana at home? It's surprisingly easy but may be illegal where you live,Learning to grow cannabis from Colorado's home-growing experts.,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/03/02/how-grow-marijuana-home-its-surprisingly-easy-but-may-illegal-where-you-live/389556002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable,2018-03-02T19:14:39Z,"Many states permit residents to grow marijuana for their personal use, and we decided to look at just how easy it is to grow cannabis -- known as pot or weed -- at home. Trevor Hughes, Austin Humphries, USA TODAY NETWORK Experts say starting marijuana from clones -- cuttings taken from another plant -- is the best way to start growing cannabis. It helps ensure that the plants are all female, and jumpstarts the growing process. (Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY) With so many Americans now living in states where it’s legal to grow marijuana for their own use, we wanted to show the basics of cannabis cultivation, with help from the experts at Colorado’s Organic Alternatives. As of March 1, Alaska, California, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada and Vermont have legalized recreational marijuana use, as has the District of Columbia. The exact rules vary in each state, so it's best to check with your local regulators. And of course it's also good to remember that marijuana possession remains entirely illegal under federal law. In this attached video, you’ll see a pot plant go from a cutting to a mature bush in about four months, along with an explanation of the basics of growing this “weed,” which our expert says is actually really easy. ""It's not difficult at all. Essentially you're growing a weed,"" says Kirk Scramstead, a growing expert for Organic Alternatives. ""It's a super easy plant to grow."" More: Marijuana equipment start-ups flourish as large rivals avoid legal pitfalls Organic Alternatives grows high-quality marijuana at its facility in Fort Collins, Colo., and each plant can generate about 4 ounces of smokeable cannabis flowers. Scramstead said amateur growers can't expect such a high yield, but people with a green thumb could expect similar results if they take time and care in their growing. While Scamstead said a pot plant will grow just fine outside with regular watering, enthusiasts are willing to spend thousands of dollars on special lights, fertilizer and irrigation systems to ensure a consistent crop. There's even companies selling self-contained growing cabinets, which make the process even easier.

10,Effects of E.coli Outbreak in Lettuce Ripple Through Food-Supply Chain...,"The outbreak of E.coli traced to romaine lettuce grown in Yuma, Ariz., is expected to deal a multimillion-dollar blow to the food industry.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/effects-of-e-coli-outbreak-in-lettuce-ripple-through-u-s-food-supply-chain-1527681604,2018-05-30T12:04:37Z,"A deadly E.coli outbreak tied to romaine lettuce has shaken consumers’ faith in the nation’s favorite salad green, resulting in millions of dollars in losses for growers, retailers and restaurants. More than six weeks into the outbreak, prices for romaine, historically the most-sold salad green, have dropped by more than half. Grocers nationwide have been clearing it from shelves in hundreds of stores. Several restaurants that served romaine are facing lawsuits from customers, and wholesalers have had to quickly round up kale and mesclun for restaurants that struck it from their menus. Federal health officials now say tainted romaine is gone from the marketplace. But for weeks it urged consumers to throw away any romaine lettuce left in their homes and to avoid eating or buying it unless they were certain it wasn’t grown in the desert region of Yuma, Ariz. Officials have traced the problem to Yuma, but they haven’t been able to pinpoint the exact source of much of the lettuce that has been tied to 172 illnesses and one death. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says the last shipments of romaine from Yuma were harvested on April 16, and the harvest season there is over—making it unlikely that romaine from Yuma is still available in stores, restaurants or people’s homes. “It’s [cost] thousands and thousands of dollars, it could even run into the millions,” said Howard Popoola, Kroger Co.’s vice president of corporate food technology and regulatory compliance, referring to costs at the largest U.S. supermarket chain. Growers and sellers of romaine lettuce fear it could take months or longer for sales to recover. Earlier this month, sales had dropped 45% from the year-ago period, according to Nielsen figures. The outbreak has hurt other leafy greens, with overall lettuce sales earlier this month down more than 27%. U.S. lettuce production was valued at $3.6 billion in 2017, making it the leading vegetable crop by value. Prices for whole romaine heads have tumbled as much as 60% since early April, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said technical advances are helping regulators better identify the origins of food-borne illnesses, and they are helping to keep food safer. “Our tools and our regulatory oversight have gotten more effective and more vigilant,” he said in an interview. Taylor Fresh Foods, a major salad producer known as Taylor Farms, has abandoned hundreds of acres of lettuce in the desert growing region since then, plowing under ripe produce or leaving it to rot. “Trucks all across the country were dumping romaine,” said Drew McDonald, vice president of quality and food safety at the Salinas, Calif.-based company. “The loss of all that product was significant for us because of our size,” he said, adding that the company in April scrambled to shift production north to its central California farms to supply retailers and restaurants seeking to replenish stocks. Ratto Bros., a smaller family farm based in Modesto, Calif., says it has lost $120,000 so far, after having planted enough romaine to fill an extra 20,000 cases this year. “It’s pretty devastating,” said Frank Ratto, the company’s vice president of marketing. Growers fear the current outbreak could mirror a 2006 E.coli outbreak tied to spinach that killed three people and sickened more than 200. Economic losses from that outbreak totaled $350 million, according to an academic estimate. “We never really got our footing back after that,” said Dan Sutton, general manager at Pismo Oceano Vegetable Exchange, a California-based leafy greens producer. He said Pismo grows half the volume of spinach it did before the 2006 outbreak because of reduced demand. It has abandoned one-third of its romaine lettuce this year. Some retailers have had to hire workers to pull romaine from shelves, hang signs and counsel shoppers about the safety of lettuce. “Consumer confusion about lettuce safety has followed,” said Richard Phegley, chief financial officer for West Coast-based Smart &amp; Final Stores, Inc., a grocery chain that lost sales across the lettuce aisle. The effort has taxed rank-and-file workers as well as chief executives at major companies. After a Kroger meal-kit customer complained about the lettuce on sandwiches featured in the grocer’s boxes, company Chief Executive Rodney McMullen tasked Mr. Popoola with calling and reassuring the shopper about its safety. The lettuce outbreak “will continue to haunt us for a whole long time,” Mr. Popoola said. Retailers are eager for regulators to determine the source of the outbreak so they can try to recoup some of their costs. Supply-chain contracts typically require that retailers and restaurants pay for the cost of pulling product during an outbreak, unless a supplier has been identified and a recall initiated; some contracts require the supplier to reimburse distributors for related expenses, according to Angela Spivey, a food and beverage attorney at McGuireWoods LLP. Supermarkets also are eager to regain the confidence of shoppers like Francesca LaBianco, a 24-year-old office worker from New Jersey’s Bergen County, who shops at ShopRite Supermarkets Inc. “I don’t want to risk eating it if it can cause me to be sick,” she said. Restaurants, meanwhile, raced to determine the source of their romaine, removed it from menus or added other salad greens. Although its romaine wasn’t implicated in the outbreak, Just Salad, a fast-casual chain with nearly 30 U.S. stores in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia, decided for the first time to add iceberg lettuce to its menu for customers seeking alternative greens, said Janani Lee, purchasing manager for the chain. That meant working with suppliers to find a reliable iceberg source and training teams how to handle the new ingredient. Just Salad moved quickly to inform customers via email and social media that its lettuce was safe to eat. “We want to make sure customers can keep trusting us,” Ms. Lee said. People sickened in the outbreak have filed lawsuits against several restaurants including Panera Bread Co. Walmart, Inc., its Sam’s Club division and Taylor Farms also face a class-action suit in California accusing the retailers of exposing consumers to potentially tainted romaine and not pulling the produce. “Food safety is important to us,” said a statement on Panera’s website. “When something happens, like the recent industry-wide issues affecting romaine lettuce harvested in Yuma, Arizona, we act quickly to remove the risk from our cafes.” The company said that it “promptly” removed Yuma romaine from its stores after federal health officials issued a public advisory, and that the lettuce it is serving now is unaffected. A single food-borne illness outbreak can cost a restaurant up to as much as $2.6 million, according to an April study by researchers at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

(Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY) DENVER — Marijuana business owners are increasingly pouring their profits into lobbying lawmakers as they face a federal crackdown from the Trump administration. A USA TODAY survey found hundreds of thousands of dollars flowing from the cannabis industry into campaign finance accounts of both lawmakers and political action committees, with emphasis this year on Congressional Republicans who are trying to stop the Trump administration from targeting marijuana businesses. Combined, medical and recreational marijuana marketplaces across the country are worth a staggering $8 billion, and last year generated at least $2 billion in taxes, said Matt Karnes of cannabis data firm GreenWave Advisors. It’s no surprise those businesses want to protect what they’ve built, experts say. “These are legitimate, taxpaying businesses that want and deserve to be heard, and lawmakers at every level of government have become more comfortable with accepting their contributions,” said Mason Tvert, a cannabis activist who helped lead Colorado’s legalization effort in 2012.

(Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY) Eight states, along with the District of Columbia, permit adults to possess small amounts of marijuana, and Vermont's governor was expected to make pot legal in the Green Mountain state this weekend. Money is also flowing at the state level, where legislators and regulators decide on details about packaging, testing and even who can get business licenses. Legalization ballot initiatives across the country have also been backed by millions of dollars, particularly in California. Cannabis lobbying groups, including the Marijuana Policy Project (MPP) and National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), have long lobbied lawmakers, but now marijuana business owners themselves are contributing — and letting everyone know it. John Lord, the CEO of Colorado-based LivWell Enlightened Health, whose company employs more than 600 people, has donated nearly $23,000 to federal lawmakers in the past four years, and another $10,000 to Colorado politicians and issue committees. Increasingly he’s been giving to Republicans at the federal level. ""It would be rather imprudent if I didn’t,” Lord said. Lord's donations make him one of the biggest individual donors in cannabis campaign contributions nationally, at least among those who admit where the money comes from. While campaign donors are supposed to disclose their employer, many black-market marijuana growers simply say they're self-employed or a consultant, obscuring the source of the money. Democrats have typically been the largest recipients of marijuana campaign money in the past, but Republicans are now taking the lead in accepting those donations, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which analyzed contributions at the request of USA TODAY. Experts say the recent shift is largely attributable to the belief by marijuana businesses that Republicans who support states' rights are their best allies today. Preston Mekelburg, 22, weighs and packages marijuana at the Medicine Man cannabis dispensary in Denver. (Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY) Because marijuana contributions make up such a small percentage of campaign donations and lobbying spending, it's hard to track exactly how much money is flowing to candidates. Industry groups with political action committees are the biggest donors, among them the MPP, NORML and the National Cannabis Industry Association, which combined have donated about $327,000 to candidates over the past three Congressional election cycles, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. By comparison, the National Beer Wholesalers Association donated about $1.5 million to candidates in the past year alone. While the marijuana contributions represent a proverbial drop in the bucket compared to traditional businesses like brewers, grocers, manufacturers or liquor stores, the increasing flow from cannabis entrepreneurs suggests the industry won’t willingly let the federal government slow this fast-growing juggernaut. Republican California Congressman Dana Rohrabacher recently became a favored lawmaker of cannabis contributors for his strong support of the industry: He's the author of legislation banning the Justice Department from targeting legal medical marijuana businesses. Rohrabacher said he’s noticing more and more marijuana money and lobbying on Capitol Hill. “They’ve got a lot to learn. But they’re learning it because they’re here now,” he said. “The voters of those states have granted them the title of legitimate businessmen.” The rapidly growing marijuana industry is finding that politicians are increasingly willing to accept their campaign contributions, said Eli Scislowicz, the operations director of the NuLeaf cannabis dispensary in Lake Tahoe’s Incline Village, Nev. “In 2007, we might have gotten a few weird looks if we offered them money, but not anymore,” he said.

12,Nut Company Owners' Foundation Lends Millions to Business Associates,"Billionaire couple Stewart and Lynda Resnick’s charitable foundation has pursued an unusual investment strategy: lending millions of dollars to the pair’s business associates. In 2016, the loans made up 88% of the organization’s total assets.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/nut-company-owners-foundation-lends-millions-to-business-associates-1530178200,2018-06-28T09:47:06Z,"For the past few years, billionaire couple Stewart and Lynda Resnick’s charitable foundation has pursued an unusual investment strategy: lending millions of dollars to the pair’s business associates. In 2016, the foundation reported $50 million in outstanding loans to two companies whose owners supply nuts to the couple’s pistachio empire, according to interviews and the charity’s latest available tax filings. The Resnicks own the privately held Wonderful Company, the nation’s largest grower of tree nuts, including pistachios. The Los Angeles company also packages pomegranate juice, citrus fruits and bottled water. The couple founded the Resnick Foundation two decades ago. Mr. Resnick was president of the organization, Ms. Resnick was chairwoman and four senior officials at Wonderful were also officers of the foundation in 2016, filings show. The loans in 2016 made up 88% of the foundation’s total assets, its filings show. Federal tax law doesn’t expressly address whether foundations, tax-exempt and set up with charitable missions, can lend money to their officers’ business associates. The organizations are barred from lending money to companies owned by their officers or benefactors, under a half-century-old federal law that bars self-dealing. Experts, including former state and federal charities regulators, were divided as to whether loans to companies that do business with a charity’s insiders should be allowed under that law. One expert said such transactions could be a form of indirect self-dealing because it enhances the businesses’ ties to the lenders. However, another tax attorney said foundations may be legally allowed to lend money to people who have business ties to their officers, even lots of it, as long as the interest is market-rate and the terms are reasonable. A representative for the Internal Revenue Service said the agency doesn’t comment on individual tax cases. Private foundations seldom make loans. About 3% of foundations reported any notes or loans receivable on their balance sheets, The Wall Street Journal found in an analysis of more than 60,000 fiscal-year 2016 foundation tax returns filed in electronic form. Most foundations were owed less than $100,000, and some of the amounts reported were notes receivable donated to foundations by estates. A schedule on the Resnick Foundation’s tax filings says the loans to the two companies have a 0% interest rate, but a person familiar with the matter said that figure is erroneous. Rather, the foundation made the interest-bearing loans, which are due within a year, as part of a low-risk investment strategy. The 0% figure was generated by the tax-preparation software the foundation used because the interest-rate field was left blank, he said. Farid Assemi, president of Assemi Brothers LLC, which received one of the outstanding loans from the foundation, said that the company pays interest at 1.44% above the one-month Libor rate. That would mean the company is paying interest at about 3.5%, based on the one-month Libor rates posted in June 2018. That is lower than the prime rate, a benchmark rate for commercial-bank lending to top clients, which is now 5%. The foundation began lending to Assemi Brothers in 2014, filings show. The company owed $45 million in 2016. Mr. Assemi said the company, which he founded with his two brothers, is an investment vehicle for their farming and real-estate assets. “The foundation is lending the money to us, because they’re making good returns and they trust us,” Mr. Assemi said. “It’s pretty deep respect and friendship.” Before making the loans, the foundation “had the idle cash and we could use the cash,” said Mr. Assemi, who said he asked for the loan. He said that the interest his company paid gave the foundation a high rate of return compared with what the charity would earn if it put its money in a certificate of deposit. Mr. Assemi said his and Mr. Resnick’s companies have maintained a relationship for over a decade, when Mr. Assemi’s company sold Mr. Resnick’s company a pistachio-processing plant. Since then, Mr. Assemi has sent his pistachio crops to Mr. Resnick for processing and distribution. One thing that unites the two men is their philanthropic efforts, Mr. Assemi said. The Assemi family helped found the California Health Sciences University, which aims to provide medical training in California’s low-income Central Valley and has backed a hospital in Afghanistan and an orphanage in Iraq. Mr. Assemi said the loan goes into the company’s working capital, and though not all of the money goes to charitable causes, it helps the company further its good works. The Resnicks’ foundation has given away nearly $100 million over the past decade, tax filings show. Its beneficiaries have included organizations supporting education, the arts and health care. The couple has donated to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, home to a pavilion that bears their name, and the University of California, Los Angeles, where the Resnick Neuropsychiatric Hospital is named after them. The Wonderful Company is active in Central Valley education initiatives, including Wonderful College Prep Academy, a charter school. About a decade ago, the foundation had assets worth less than $1 million. More recently it has received large gifts from both Mr. Resnick, who donated $62.5 million in 2015, and from other companies with whom the couple’s company does business. Those included a $40 million gift from Sun Pacific Marketing Cooperative in 2013. That amount came from the settlement over a branding dispute, according to Berne Evans, Sun Pacific’s chief executive. Sun Pacific and the Resnicks’ company previously co-produced seedless mandarins known as Cuties. In addition to Assemi Brothers, the Resnick Foundation has lent money to Central Green LP, another company with connections to Wonderful. The foundation reported $4.8 million on loan to that company in 2016. Larry Freels, general partner of Central Green, didn’t respond to requests for comment. According to a senior official at American Pistachio Growers, a trade group, Mr. Freels’s company also delivers pistachios to Wonderful. Mr. Freels is listed as a principal of the Wonderful Growers Cooperative on documents filed with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,What California's legalization of marijuana means for you,Pot will soon be legal in California. Here's what you need to know,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/12/28/what-californias-legalization-marijuana-means-you/975348001/,2017-12-28T11:00:03Z,"Jars of dried marijuana flowers sit inside a display cabinet at the Denver-based Medicine Man marijuana store. Each jar contains about 2 ounces of marijuana, which sells for about $160 per ounce, depending on quality. This marijuana is legal to sell to adults under Colorado law, but remains illegal at the federal level. (Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY) Monday ushers in the start of legal marijuana sales to California, and along with it, a host of questions about exactly how the system will work and the rules people need to follow. Broadly speaking, California's rules are similar to those used by other states that have legalized recreational (sometimes known as ""adult use"") marijuana. But the Golden State's sheer size brings additional challenges and opportunities for sellers and marijuana tourists alike. Here's what California's marijuana legalization means for you: How old do I have to be, and do I have to be a California resident? Anyone 21 and older can buy and consume marijuana when you're in California, regardless of whether you're a resident of the state or just visiting. It’s called “recreational” marijuana, to distinguish it from “medical” marijuana, which requires a doctor’s recommendation. Stores must keep youngsters off the premises, and the cannabis products must be sold in child-resistant containers to reduce the risk of accidental ingestion by curious kids. Marijuana clones are offered for sale at Harbourside Health Center in Oakland, Calif. (Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY) How much can I buy? You’ll be able to buy up to one ounce (28.5 grams) of marijuana from a licensed store for personal use. The law limits you to possessing one ounce at a time, which means you can only buy more if you use it up or give it away. Regular people aren’t allowed to sell pot, although they can give it away. The law allows people to grow up to six plants worth of a marijuana at a time for personal use. A box of joints awaits customers at Harborside Health Center in Oakland, Calif. (Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY) Is this going to be like my college experience? Probably not – today’s marijuana is far more potent than the cannabis grown decades ago, and infused edibles, hash, oil, wax and “dabs” allow you to consume far more than if you were just smoking a joint. However, one federal study found that people who smoke stronger marijuana simply use less, at least at first. If you’re going to indulge, pace yourself, and that recommendation bears repeating a few more times for anyone trying edibles for the first time. Edibles take longer to kick in than smoked marijuana, so it’s easy to accidentally consume more than you should. A bright green marijuana plant grows inside a Leaf marijuana ""refrigerator"" at the company's research lab inside a garage in Greeley, Colo. (Photo: Trevor Hughes/USA TODAY) Where can I consume it? Not a lot of places. California has strict anti-tobacco laws limiting where people can smoke in public, the workplace or hotels. Your best bet is a private home. You can’t light up on the beach, and driving while high is illegal. Anti-smoking laws are one reason edible marijuana products have become so popular; in addition to being seen as healthier, they’re a lot more discreet. Jars of marijuana sit away customers at Harborside Health Center in Oakland, Calif. (Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY) Wait. Isn’t this still all entirely illegal at the federal level? Yup. Federal agents could prosecute anyone they catch with pot bought in one of these recreational stores. The store owners, distributors and growers are also exposed to federal prosecution as drug dealers, and banks caught handling their cash could be prosecuted under organized-crime laws. Furthermore, people with commercial or pilots’ licenses or federal security clearances, along with federal employees and contractors, can still lose their jobs if they’re caught using pot. That being said, it's highly unlikely the feds would target individual customers. Instead, they've largely gone after people who have been growing pot intended for the black market. A marijuana user smokes a joint of Colorado-legal cannabis during a marijuana pairing dinner in Boulder, Colo. (Photo: Trevor Hughes/USA TODAY) Can I take it home? Nope. Airport TSA agents are generally not looking for drugs in your bags but if they find any marijuana, they can call the local police, who could arrest you for possession, since airports are covered by federal rules. In legal states, airports provide trash cans before security and post reminders not to fly with marijuana. Even though marijuana is legal in both Nevada and Oregon, you’re not supposed to cross state borders with it. The easy rule of thumb: Consume your cannabis in the state you bought it. A marijuana researcher walks though a grow warehouse in Denver in 2015. The Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear a lawsuit brought by Oklahoma and Nebraska over Colorado's legal marijuana marketplace. (Photo: Trevor Hughes/USA TODAY) Where are my taxes going? The state is levying a 15% tax on marijuana, collected by the distribution companies. Cities and towns can also add their own taxes on top of that. The special state tax is supposed to be dedicated to a host of special areas, from increased black-market enforcement to environmental protection and grants to help low-income people find work. In other states, marijuana taxes have been used to help the homeless, repair and expand schools, and even send kids to college. Glass jars of high-grade Colorado-grown marijuana sit on a shelf at a Pueblo-area cannabis store. Pueblo County officials are using some of the taxes collected on marijuana to find scholarships for local college students. (Photo: Trevor Hughes/USA TODAY) How will this change the price for black-market cannabis elsewhere? Unclear. An estimate by cannabis data firm GreenWave Advisors suggests that half of the marijuana grown in California is illegally sold elsewhere. If the majority of California growers go legitimate and sell through the state’s legal system, that could significantly reduce the flow of black-market pot available elsewhere in the United States, driving up prices. And that's why legalization advocates say more states should make pot legal, thus eliminating the black market and generating more local taxes. Critics counter that legalizing more marijuana wrongly sends the message to kids that pot is safe to use.

Thousands of marijuana tourists are visiting Denver -- and stocking up in stores like Medicine Man -- for the annual 420 celebration. (Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY) Are there any deals available? Probably lots of them. This one made us laugh the most: Cannabis firm Merry Jane is partnering with Jack in the Box to offer a special “420” deal at three of the fast-food chain’s Long Beach, Calif., locations shortly after legalization begins. The “MERRY Munchie Meal” includes an order of curly fries and onion rings, two tacos, five mini churros, three chicken strips and a small drink, all for $4.20, plus tax. But sorry, no pot included: you'll have to buy that separately.

14,Special Report: Appetite for destruction - Soy boom devours Brazil's tropical savanna,"When farmer Julimar Pansera purchased land in Brazil's interior seven years ago, it was blanketed in tiers of fruit trees, twisted shrubs and the occasional palm standing tall in a thicket of undergrowth.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-deforestation-specialreport/special-report-appetite-for-destruction-soy-boom-devours-brazils-tropical-savanna-idUSKCN1LD16B,2018-08-28T11:11:12Z,"CAMPOS LINDOS, Brazil (Reuters) - When farmer Julimar Pansera purchased land in Brazil’s interior seven years ago, it was blanketed in tiers of fruit trees, twisted shrubs and the occasional palm standing tall in a thicket of undergrowth. He mowed down most of that vegetation, set it ablaze and started planting soybeans. Over the past decade, he and others in the region have deforested an area larger than South Korea. Permissive land-use policies and cheap farm acreage here have helped catapult Brazil into an agricultural superpower, the world’s largest exporter of soy, beef and chicken and a major producer of pork and corn. This area has also lured farmers and ranchers away from the Amazon jungle, whose decline has spurred a global outcry to protect it. The tradeoff, environmentalists say, is that while Brazil has slowed destruction of the renowned rainforest from its worst levels, it has put another vital ecological zone at risk: a vast tropical savanna that is home to 5 percent of species on the planet. Known as the Cerrado, this habitat lost more than 105,000 square kilometers (40,541 square miles) of native cover since 2008, according to government figures. That’s 50 percent more than the deforestation seen during the same period in the Amazon, a biome more than three times larger. Accounting for relative size, the Cerrado is disappearing nearly four times faster than the rainforest. The largest savanna in South America, the Cerrado is a vital storehouse for carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas whose rising emissions from fossil fuels and deforestation are warming the world’s atmosphere. Brazilian officials have cited protection of native vegetation as critical to meeting its obligations under the Paris Agreement on climate change. But scientists warn the biome has reached a tipping point that could hamper Brazil’s efforts and worsen global warming. By focusing on one problem, Brazil essentially created another, said Ane Alencar, science director of the non-profit Amazon Environmental Research Institute, known as IPAM. “There’s a high risk for the climate associated with this expansion,” Alencar said. “Limiting and calling attention to deforestation in the Amazon, in a way it forced the agribusiness industry to expand in the Cerrado.” The toll can already be seen in the region’s water resources. Streams and springs are filling with silt and drying up as vegetation around them vanishes. That in turn is weakening the headwaters of vital rivers flowing to the rest of the country, scientists say. The imperiled waterways include the Sao Francisco, Brazil’s longest river outside the Amazon, where water levels are hitting never-before-seen lows in the dry season. “The removal of vegetation can lead a body of water to extinction,” said Liliana Pena Naval, an environmental engineering professor at the Federal University of Tocantins. Wildlife, too, is under threat, including rare hyacinth macaws, maned wolves and jaguars that call the shrinking savanna home. So are thousands of plants, fish, insects and other creatures found nowhere else on earth, many of which are only beginning to be studied. “I compare it to the burning of the ancient Library of Alexandria,” said Mercedes Bustamante, an ecologist at the University of Brasilia. “You lose the accumulated evolutionary record of thousands of years that never can be recovered.” Farmers see the Cerrado’s development as critical to global food security and their nation’s prosperity. Brazil’s agriculture sector grew a sizzling 13 percent in 2017, while the overall economy barely budged. The nation’s ability to keep producing new farmland cheaply has given it an edge over rivals and cemented its status as a vital supplier to the world’s tables. “Imagine, if not for Brazil’s production, how much more hunger would there be,” farmer Pansera said. THE GREEN REVOLUTION Roughly the size of Mexico, straddling Brazil’s mid-section from its far western borders with Paraguay and stretching northeast towards the Atlantic coast, the Cerrado has seen about half of its native forests and grasslands converted to farms, pastures and urban areas over the past 50 years. Deforestation in the region has slowed from the early 2000s, when Brazil’s soy boom was gaining steam. Still, farmers continue to plow under vast stretches of the biome, propelled largely by Chinese demand for Brazilian meat and grain. The Asian nation is Brazil’s No. 1 buyer of soybeans to fatten its own hogs and chickens. China is also a major purchaser of Brazilian pork, beef and poultry to satisfy the tastes of its increasingly affluent consumers. Rising trade tensions between China and the United States have only deepened that connection. Brazil’s soybean exports by value to China are up 18 percent through the first seven months of the year as Chinese buyers have canceled tens of millions of dollars’ worth of contracts with U.S. suppliers. The trend bodes well for producers in the Cerrado’s frontier region known as Matopiba, shorthand for the northeastern Brazilian states of Maranhao, Tocantins, Piaui and Bahia. Land here is cheap. Virgin plots near Pansera in the state of Tocantins can be had for $248 an acre on average, according to agribusiness consultancy Informa Economics IEG FNP. That compares to an average of $3,080 per acre for already cleared farmland in the United States. Soy planting in Matopiba has more than doubled over the past decade. Pansera, 50, is part of a wave of industrious transplants from southern Brazil who are remaking the region. His formal education stopped at middle school, but he found land enough in the Cerrado to match his big ambitions. He now presides over nearly 19 square miles (49 square kilometers) of manicured soy fields and has about 20 full-time workers on his payroll. Pansera’s soybeans will bring in an estimated profit of nearly 5 million reais ($1.23 million) this year, most of which he plans to invest back into the farm. Government policies have intentionally driven industrial-scale farming here. Short on farmland to feed its growing population, Brazil in the 1970s looked to its vast savanna, a region early explorers had dubbed “cerrado,” or “closed,” because of its tangled woodlands. State agriculture scientists developed fertilizers and additives to fix the acidic, nutrient-poor earth and created soybean strains that could thrive in the tropics. Arable land exploded. Within a decade, Brazil transformed itself from a food importer to a net exporter. By the 1990s it was moving global commodities markets. “Agriculture in the Cerrado is what took Brazil to the next level,” Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi told Reuters. Known as Brazil’s “Soy King,” Maggi is a billionaire whose family runs one of the largest private soybean operations in the world, much of it in the Cerrado. Maggi said growers are respectful of legally allowed limits on deforestation. Their “rational” occupation of the Cerrado has helped Brazil’s economy, he said. Farmers have emerged as a powerful political force bent on keeping Brazil’s countryside open for business. Lawmakers in the country’s largely rural, pro-agriculture voting bloc, who comprise more than 40 percent of the nation’s congress, have led a rollback of environmental laws in recent years. Those efforts include a 2012 loosening of Brazil’s landmark Forest Code that sets requirements for preserving native vegetation. The change reduced potential penalties for farmers, ranchers and loggers charged with past illegal deforestation, and made it easier for landowners to clear more of their holdings. Annual deforestation in the Amazon last year was up 52 percent from a record low in 2012. Still, environmental protections there remain the most robust in Brazil. Rainforest farmers are required by law to preserve 80 percent of native vegetation on their plots. And global grain traders in 2006 voluntarily agreed to stop purchasing any soy harvested from newly deforested Amazon jungle areas. As part of its obligations under the Paris Agreement, the government pledged to eliminate illegal Amazon deforestation by 2030. Brazil has made no similar push to preserve the Cerrado, which has long been viewed as a resource to be developed. Cerrado farmers are required to preserve as little as 20 percent of the natural cover, and up to 35 percent in areas neighboring the Amazon. Those who don’t maximize use of their tracts risk having their land declared idle and subject to redistribution under a 1980 federal land-reform initiative aimed at assisting rural, low-income people, said Elvison Nunes Ramos, sustainability coordinator with the Ministry of Agriculture. “The message being sent to the farmer is that he should not preserve, he should deforest,” Nunes Ramos said of the policy. A spokesman for Incra, the government agency that verifies the use of the rural land, said its job is to ensure “the fulfillment of the social function of the property.” WATER, WILDLIFE UNDER THREAT Environmentalists say the Cerrado’s wooded grasslands have failed to capture the public’s attention the way the Amazon’s lush jungles have. People view the Cerrado “just as bushes, twisted vegetation and shrubs,” lamented Alencar, the science director at IPAM. What many don’t see, she said, is the connection between the soybean-fed meat on their plates and the steady decline of one of the world’s great carbon sinks, a bulwark against global warming. Plants here send roots deep into the earth to survive seasonal drought and fires, creating a vast underground network that some have likened to an upside-down forest. Destruction of surface vegetation, and the resulting die-off of the life below, released 248 million tonnes of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere in 2016, according to estimates by the Climate Observatory, a Brazilian conservation group. That’s roughly two-and-a-half times the annual tailpipe emissions from all cars in Brazil. Watersheds are hurting, too. In Palmeirante, a rural municipality in the state of Tocantins, subsistence farmer Ronivon Matias de Andrade blames expanding mega-farms for damaging a community water source. Dressed in faded shorts and flip flops, he showed a visitor the remains of what until recently had been a shady woodland: uprooted trees and freshly exposed earth pocked with heavy-equipment tracks. Stripped of its vegetation, sandy topsoil is now filling a nearby creek and an adjoining freshwater pool where he and other rural families draw drinking water. He scooped up a murky handful in disgust. “How many are being finished off in this manner in this state?” 43-year-old Andrade said. Environmentalists say vanishing creeks like those in Palmeirante are threatening the nation’s water supply. Seemingly insignificant sources - tiny brooks, nameless rivulets - are vital building blocks supplying water to tributary streams that in turn feed some of Brazil’s largest rivers. Of a dozen major water systems in Brazil, eight are born in the Cerrado. They include the Sao Francisco, the country’s fourth-largest river, which was once famed for its paddle-wheeled riverboats known as gaiolas. Environmentalists say man-made diversions, including agriculture and hydroelectric dams, have helped alter water levels to a degree that long stretches of the river are now unnavigable during the dry season. Loss of native ground cover is also driving microclimate change in the region, they say. Reduced vegetation leads to higher ground temperatures and lower humidity, a recipe for less rainfall. A study conducted at the University of Brasilia links deforestation to an 8.4 percent drop in precipitation from 1977 to 2010 in the Cerrado. Cerrado wildlife is under pressure as habitat shrinks. More than 300 species that dwell here are considered threatened with extinction, according to the government. Among them are 44 rare types of “annual fish” unique to the Cerrado whose short lives begin with spring rains and end with the summer heat. Scientists suspect that increasing dry spells could be interrupting their delicate reproduction cycles. Other creatures, including rheas - giant ostrich-like birds – will soon join the endangered species list if nothing is done to reverse the slide, says Ricardo Machado, a zoology professor at the University of Brasilia. He said the birds’ numbers have plummeted due to loss of native ground cover critical to breeding and nesting. Machado worries that unique Cerrado plants, insects and other creatures may vanish before scientists have an opportunity to identify them, much less study them. “There is a universe to be discovered,” Machado said. “All attention is focused on the Amazon, no one speaks for the Cerrado.” REINING IN THE SOY BOOM That’s beginning to change. Dozens of groups, including Greenpeace, the World Wildlife Foundation and the Brazilian research group IPAM, last year began pushing for large multinationals to protect the biome. In a document known as the Cerrado Manifesto, they called for immediate action to stop deforestation in the region. More than 60 companies, including McDonalds, Unilever and Walmart, have signed on so far. The firms have agreed to support measures that would eliminate native vegetation loss in the Cerrado from their supply chains. But in contrast to the 2006 Amazon soy moratorium, the Cerrado Manifesto did not commit signatories to halt purchases of farm products from newly deforested areas. Walmart and Unilever said they are committed to achieving zero net deforestation in their supply chains by 2020, meaning any destruction in one region would be offset by recuperation of similar forest elsewhere. Walmart said all its beef suppliers in the Cerrado are monitored to ensure they don’t contribute to deforestation there. McDonalds didn’t respond to a request for comment. Separately, Netherlands-based Louis Dreyfus Company in June became the first major commodity trader to pledge to stop buying soy from newly deforested land specifically in the Cerrado. The company gave no timetable, but said it would work to establish a “realistic target date” to end deforestation in its Cerrado supply chain. Brazil’s former Minister of Environment Jose Sarney Filho, who recently left office to run for Senate, has proposed an international effort to compensate landowners who preserve natural habitat. He raised the issue at last November’s global climate summit in Germany, but the effort has yet to attract major backers. Farmer Pansera, meanwhile, sees big things ahead for his patch of the Cerrado. Supervising the harvest on his land earlier this year, he watched a pair of combines chew through rows of soybean plants. The giant machines stripped away the beans and spit them into empty grain trucks rolling just behind to catch the bounty. He said there is no future without growth, and the frontier region of Matopiba is just getting started. He plans to plant an additional 180 hectares of soy next year on newly cleared land. “There is still a large area to be opened,” Pansera said. “It will be one of the great centers of Brazilian agriculture.” Reporting by Jake Spring; Editing by Marla Dickerson",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,Hydroponics companies expecting a flood of customers after marijuana is legalized,"‘There will be a huge influx of people just trying it out for the first time,’ says Justin Cooper, co-founder of nutrients manufacturer and hydroponics wholesaler Green Planet Wholesale Ltd.",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/sb-managing/hydroponics-companies-expecting-a-flood-of-customers-after-marijuana-is-legalized/article37284131/,2017-12-11T10:00:00Z,"In October, marijuana industry heavy hitter Aurora Cannabis Inc. spent $3.85-million to acquire BC Northern Lights Enterprises Ltd., a Vancouver-based company that manufactures refrigerator-sized ""grow boxes."" The miniature nurseries, loaded up with high-powered lights, ventilation systems and hydroponics equipment, are designed to hold four to 18 marijuana plants and made specifically for the home-growing market. BCNL, which has been around for nearly two decades, has been selling boxes to medical-marijuana users since limited home growing became legal in 2001 for patients with government-approved growing licences. With the federal government legalizing recreational cannabis use this coming summer, BCNL's chief executive officer Tarren Wolfe is expecting an avalanche of new customers. ""I believe [the number of home growers] is at least going to double when the doors open,"" he said. That could mean tens of thousands of new hobby horticulturalists looking for an easy way to cultivate. In the overall context of Canada's ballooning cannabis market, it's unlikely that home-grown marijuana will ever make up more than a small portion of consumption. The federal government's draft marijuana legislation has capped the number of plants recreational users can grow at four. Quebec has already given a firm no to any recreational home growing and challenges related to the sometimes unruly medical-marijuana home-growing market could invite further restrictions. Story continues below advertisement But even with these caveats, companies that have long worked in the world of hydroponics – the technique of cultivating plants indoors using artificial light and water-based nutrients – are expecting to benefit from a wave of DIY enthusiasm. ""There will be a huge influx of people just trying it out for the first time,"" said Justin Cooper, co-founder of Surrey B.C.-based nutrients manufacturer and hydroponics wholesaler Green Planet Wholesale Ltd. ""It will be like beer and wine: you can brew your own, which most people don't do. But the ability to go brew your own has also led to the craft industry, and that's now a huge component of the beer industry."" Green Planet is scaling up its manufacturing and distribution capacity to meet the expected demand, Mr. Cooper said. He sees his company doubling in size within the next 24 months, from around 75 employees to around 150. Part of that growth will be driven by supply contracts with licensed producers, he said. But supplying home growers could ""easily be 50 per cent of our business,"" he added. Whether this demand will be seen at the level of storefront hydroponics retailers is less clear, according to Trevor Wilkinson, owner of Toronto hydroponics store Grow It All Inc. ""I think in the short run we'll see an increase in demand, as it will be a novelty,"" Mr. Wilkinson said. ""Eventually it will die down, because it will be a lot more convenient to just go out and buy your own."" Recreational legalization also has a potential downside for retailers, Mr. Wilkinson said. With cannabis-related products no longer taboo, specialized hydroponics shops, which have weathered years of restrictive regulation and public unease, could suddenly be undercut by big-box retailers. ""In the [United] States, Home Depot is already selling lighting equipment. Scotts Miracle-Gro has purchased General Hydroponics, they've purchased Botanicare … and they've gone out into large-box stores down in all the states that are legal,"" Mr. Wilkinson said. ""That's going to happen here for sure."" Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement He's hoping that the ""mom and pop"" nature of his business will help maintain a viable customer base. ""People come here because they can get some advice on how to do things,"" he said. As with other parts of the emerging cannabis market, the big winners will inevitably be the companies able to navigate the highly regulated field. Both BCNL and Aurora are betting that tight restrictions around electrical safety, moisture and scent suppression and security, will play in their favour. ""I have a feeling … that they're going to make it mandatory that anybody who wants a licence to be able to grow their own also has to provide a CSA approved box."" said Mr. Wolfe, referring to the Canadian Standards Association, which certifies electrical appliances are up to a certain standard. ""Currently, we are the only producers of that on the market."" That edge was on the mind of Cameron Battley, executive vice-president of Aurora, who described the BCNL purchases as part of the company's effort to create ""a fully integrated"" cannabis company. Unlike other licensed producers that avoid encouraging the home-grow market, lest it cut into demand for finished product, Aurora's acquisition of BCNL suggests a more optimistic vision of how companies can make money off individual producers. ""They're not short-sighted,"" Mr. Wolfe said. ""Aurora can supply the customer with everything from start to finish … They can sell [home growers] live clones, they can still supply the seed, they can supply the nutrients, they can supply the growing appliance. And then, if that customer wants to try different strains before they make up their mind on what they're going to grow, they can try the end product through them as well.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,Did Jeff Sessions Just Increase the Odds Congress Will Make Marijuana Legal?,The attorney general has created intolerable uncertainty for a growing industry that is now demanding legal protections from Congress. And lawmakers are listening.,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/01/06/jeff-sessions-marijuana-legalization-congress-216251,2018-01-06T12:05:23Z,"When Jeff Sessions announced Thursday morning he had removed the barrier that had held back federal prosecutors from pursuing marijuana cases in states that had made pot legal, he delivered on something he had all but promised when he was nominated as attorney general. Most of the marijuana world saw it coming, but they freaked out anyway. A fund of marijuana-based stocks dropped more than 9 percent in value and, as a sign of how mainstream marijuana has become, Sessions’ decision to repeal the Cole Memo, an Obama-era protection for states that have legalized marijuana, even affected the stock price of Scotts Miracle-Gro Company, which dropped more than 5 percent. Business leaders in an industry that was worth $7.9 billion in 2017, called Sessions’ action revoking “outrageous” and “economically stupid.” Story Continued Below Capitol Hill screamed just as loudly. And it wasn’t just the Democratic members of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus. It was Republican senators, too. Cory Gardner of Colorado took the Senate floor to issue an ultimatum to Sessions: “I will be putting a hold on every single nomination from the Department of Justice until Attorney General Jeff Sessions lives up to the commitment he made to me in my pre-confirmation meeting with him. The conversation we had that was specifically about this issue of states’ rights in Colorado. Until he lives up to that commitment, I’ll be holding up all nominations of the Department of Justice,” Gardner said. “The people of Colorado deserve answers. The people of Colorado deserve to be respected.” Gardner is no fringe Republican; he’s the chair of the NRSC. Even members who had been silent on the issue in the past vowed to squeeze the Department of Justice’s budget. Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat from New Hampshire, reminding reporters she’s the lead Democrat on the Department of Justice funding subcommittee, tweeted: “I’ll work to ensure that resources are devoted to opioid response NOT foolish policy of interfering with legal marijuana production.” Most of the Congressional leadership was silent on this issue, but not House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who issued a blistering statement against Sessions, saying that she would push for an amendment in the new spending bill to protect states that had legalized not just medical marijuana but recreational use too, a move that could make ongoing budget negotiations much more tense. Thursday may well turn out to be a pivotal moment in the marijuana industry’s evolution as a political force. Nearly 70 percent of Americans believe in some form of legalized marijuana, but does the nascent industry have the sway to rewrite nearly 50 years of federal drug policy? Or will it remain a splintered coalition of investors, libertarians, concerned parents of sick kids, cancer sufferers, and traumatized veterans, who have the numbers but not the concentrated lobbying effort necessary to once and for all remove marijuana from the crosshairs of federal drug enforcement? “There’s a lot of [legislators] trying to have it both ways who are now going to have to make up their mind,” said Tick Segerblom, the Nevada state senator who is considered the father of the state’s legalization movement. “Are they going to go with what the voters of their state support, or are they going to join Sessions and crack down and try to re-instate prohibition?” Right now, the answer seems to be the former. Sessions’ antipathy for a drug that has lost much of its stigma among a wide cross section of Americans has only galvanized disparate factions in Congress to protect an industry that is expected to generate $2.3 billion in state tax revenue by 2020. Senator Pat Leahy of Vermont, who just a few weeks ago declined to comment to POLITICO Magazine about whether he would work to maintain protections for medical marijuana in the 2018 omnibus spending package, tweeted on Thursday, “I'm now fighting to include my amdt in the final omnibus Approps bill so we can protect patients and law-abiding businesses.” Those law-abiding businesses are now fully engaged in this matter, and they aren’t just going to roll over and let Jeff Sessions shut them down. “I expect any actions he and the Justice Department take against the industry will be met with significant pushback from states that are benefiting greatly from an economic and quality of life standpoint,” said Jeffrey Zucker, president of Green Lion Partners, a Denver firm that promotes marijuana businesses. “The cannabis industry will continue on regardless of this decision, and in the long run this should only be a roadblock.” Leslie Bocskor, president of Electrum Partners, an asset-backed finance company invested in the marijuana market, expressed his displeasure with a wry dig at Sessions’ motives: “It is almost as if the rally in publicly traded stocks in the legal cannabis sector was too much for the AG to bear.” *** The Cole Memo was never intended to be a permanent fix to the problem posed by the conflict between states that chose to legalize marijuana and existing federal prohibitions. Written by James M. Cole, an assistant deputy attorney general in 2013, the memo gave the nation’s 93 U.S. Attorneys broad latitude to exercise prosecutorial discretion in states where marijuana had been legalized. (Mr. Cole, now in private practice, declined a request for comment for this story.) His memo was interpreted as a virtual hands-off rule, allowing medical and recreational marijuana programs to spread across the country at an unprecedented rate. Flimsy though it was, the Cole Memo nevertheless provided a measure of security for dispensary owners, growers and consumers and allowed investors to proceed with some confidence that their money was not going to be seized in a DEA sting. The best protection that Congress had been able to provide was the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment, which was passed in 2014 attached to an appropriations bill. It barred the DOJ from spending funds to interfere with the implementation of medical marijuana laws. But since then, a total of eight states have now passed full recreational use laws, mostly recently California, whose law took effect January 1. Rohrabacher-Farr (now known as Rohrabacher-Blumenauer, in honor of Democratic Representative Earl Blumenauer of Oregon, who co-sponsored the amendment) expire on January 19 if it is not renewed and does nothing to help recreationally legal states, hence the eagerness of marijuana advocates to shore up the industry’s legal standing with new legislation and Pelosi’s stated desire to bake in those protections in the budget that’s currently being negotiated. The fact that marijuana has now risen to the height of top-tier budget negotiations is a sign that the pro-marijuana coalition is no longer merely a menagerie of loud-mouth hippies, stoners, and felons, as the pro-pot crowd has been characterized in the past. The community of Americans who now rely on legal medical marijuana, estimated to be 2.6 million people in 2016, includes a variety of mainstream constituency groups like veterans, senior citizens, cancer survivors, and parents of epileptic children. The American Legion, a conservative veterans organization by any measure, has voted twice in favor of resolutions to expand research and safe access for its members. “The American Legion has been a leading advocate for the removal of cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act to enable greater research into the medical efficacy of the drug to treat ailments that impact veterans such as PTSD and chronic pain,” Joe Plenzler, Director of Media Relations for The American Legion, told POLITICO Magazine — which means Jeff Sessions just crossed the nation’s largest wartime veterans service organization. By the end of the day on Thursday, in a conference call of five members of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus, lawmakers from four of the eight states that have approved recreational marijuana railed about Sessions’ unconstitutional assault on the rights of their states to decide their own affairs. On that call, California Republican Dana Rohrabacher said that the move by Sessions to strike a blow against marijuana has had the inverse effect of raising the attention from what had previously been a states’ issue but has now become a national priority. “It’s a big plus for our efforts that the federal government is now aware that our constituents have been alerted,” Rohrabacher said. ""We can be confident we can win this fight, because this is a freedom issue.” On the same call, California Democrat Barbara Lee made it clear that she and her constituents were not going to accept Sessions’ move without a fight. “As a person of color, let me just say that the War on Drugs has been a failure… We’ve lost families, we’ve lost a generation. So this affects people of color in a big way, so we’re not going to allow them to turn back the clock. In our district, we’re going to fight this every step of the way,” the Congresswoman said. Even if Leahy protects medical marijuana programs by reauthorizing the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment in the upcoming omnibus spending bill in the conference committee, the Congressional Cannabis Caucus has less than a year to make those protections permanent. The means to do that is H.R. 1227, the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act, sponsored by Representative Thomas Garrett, a Republican from Virginia. The bill, now with 15 cosponsors, would remove marijuana from Schedule 1 and eliminate federal penalties for anyone engaged in state-legal marijuana activity. All Congress has to do is pass it. “We’ve got to act,” Rohrabacher said on the Thursday phone call. “We can’t take it for granted, and now it’s going to be a priority for us to accomplish.” As of late Friday, POLITICO Magazine could not find a single member of Congress who had issued a statement in support of Sessions’ actions. In the end, this is a self-inflicted pot crisis that could prove to be a critical test of Trump’s ability to maintain his base. “There’s a lot of old white men who are marijuana users, and the marijuana is keeping them alive,” Segerblom said from his cell phone while driving around Las Vegas. “Trump is going to have fewer to vote for him if he doesn’t keep marijuana legal.” James Higdon is a freelance writer based in Louisville and author of The Cornbread Mafia: A Homegrown Syndicate’s Code of Silence and the Biggest Marijuana Bust in American History.

17,Uncertainty roils American marijuana industry over feared federal crackdown,"Sessions' announcement widely criticized, even by Republican lawmakers",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/01/04/uncertainty-roils-american-marijuana-industry-over-feared-federal-crackdown/1004250001/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable,2018-01-04T21:00:43Z,"A marijuana user smokes a joint of Colorado-legal cannabis during a marijuana pairing dinner in Boulder, Colo. (Photo: Trevor Hughes/USA TODAY) DENVER -- Marijuana stocks tanked, investors balked and cannabis users across the country shuddered as the Trump administration signaled its willingness to clamp down on a marketplace that’s grown exponentially over the past three years. In Michigan, would-be dispensary owner Jerry Millen said he’s not panicking -- yet. Michigan permits medical marijuana, and voters this fall may be asked to legalize recreational cannabis. “Trump’s approval rating is so low that I don’t think he’s stupid enough to mess with patients,” said Millen, of Walled Lake, Mich. “What’s going to happen when they start rolling out children and senior citizens who have been helped by marijuana?” More: Justice Department to crack down on legal marijuana with rollback of Obama policy On Thursday, the Justice Department rescinded Obama administration policies that guided federal prosecutors not to interfere with state laws allowing people to use pot for medical and recreational uses, throwing the whole marketplace into confusion. In Nevada, dispensary owner Fernando Leal said he was still trying to understand the implications, but stopped short of saying he’d have to lay off any of his approximately 80 workers. “My phone’s been ringing off the hook since 4 a.m. this morning, but at this point, we’re going to operate as if it’s business as usual,” he said. In Fort Collins, Colo, dispensary owner Steve Ackerman urged his industry to hew even closer to the state regulations. ""I think that's the key, to just follow the rules,” said Ackerman, who owns Organic Alternatives. “I just think it's important that every business still adhere to the Colorado rules and regulations because those are our defense. Living within those guidelines of this business are what we have going for us and what does allow us to be here."" Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ announcement could have far-reaching implications for jobs, taxes and economic development across the country. In Colorado alone, about 35,000 people work in the legal marijuana industry, which generated more than $226 million in taxes last year on a product once sold entirely on the black market. Acknowledging the immediate stock impacts, cannabis analytics firm New Frontier Data downplayed the move, saying federal prosecutors had always retained the right to target the marijuana industry. Nevertheless, the small number of publicly traded marijuana stocks dropped sharply on Thursday. Stocks dropped similarly in early 2017 when then-White House spokesman Sean Spicer suggested Sessions might make this move.

Like many growers, Albert is considering whether to transition to sell recreational marijuana or remain solely a medical-marijuana supplier. (Photo: Trevor Hughes/USA TODAY) ""Consumers are not going to stop buying cannabis in legal states, and businesses are not going to start laying off people or closing their doors just because of this announcement. In the long run, the key question is how, specifically, the DOJ intends to enforce federal law in legal states, and that is still too early to tell,” said New Frontier Data CEO Giadha Aguirre De Carcer. Eight states have legalized recreational marijuana, including California, which began sales Monday. Industry advocates say Sessions’ announcement will likely dissuade large investors who were already worried about an industry that remains entirely illegal at the federal level. A separate law already protects the medical marijuana industry, although it’s due to expire later this month. Matthew Schweich of the pro-legalization Marijuana Policy Project noted that a recent Gallup poll shows 64% of Americans support making marijuana legal for adults, but said he worries the Trump administration could unleash the FBI against communities that voted to legalize.

While no marijuana is being sold or grown in Nipton, Calif., the company’s renovations are well underway. Parker McMillan looks over products at MedMen in West Hollywood, Calif. on Jan 2, 2018.

More: Bought by a marijuana company, small California town on way to becoming pot mecca Marijuana enthusiasts who spent the past three years developing a wide-ranging array of products say Sessions’ move also risks chilling the industry’s entrepreneurial spirit. They note that the American cannabis industry is 100% homegrown. “The most disappointing point about this is that it goes against what over half the states and half the population of the country have voted to support,” said Jeffry Paul of Cannabiniers, a Nevada-based manufacturer of cannabis-infused teas and coffee. “The attorney general is going against the will of the people, which the government is supposed to take into consideration. President Trump’s platform was about creating jobs and this industry alone in California is projected at $8 billion, which is creating thousands and thousands of jobs. Ultimately the will of the people and job creation is in jeopardy, so what is the objective here being put forth?” In his announcement, Sessions said he was simply revoking an Obama-era rule that inappropriately substituted the judgement of bureaucrats for that of Congress. The federal government has refused to lower the classification of marijuana from a Schedule 1 drug, keeping it on par with narcotics like heroin and cocaine, despite its widespread use and little evidence that cannabis is anywhere near as harmful as even alcohol.

(Photo: Damon Arthur/Record Searchlight) California’s marijuana marketplace, which launched Monday, is posed to become a worldwide phenomenon worth a much as $5.1 billion this year, according to cannabis financial analysis firm GreenWave Advisors. Marijuana tourism is also a fast-growing industry across the states where cannabis is legal for adults to buy: California, Nevada, Colorado, Oregon, Washington and Alaska. Maine and Massachusetts have legalized cannabis but not yet launched sales. ""This move represents a broken campaign promise by the president,” said Tom Angell of the pro-legalization group Marijuana Majority. “He clearly and repeatedly pledged that he would respect state marijuana laws if elected. With polls showing that marijuana legalization is way more popular than the president is, this will likely turn out to be a huge political disaster for the administration.

18,‘I Am a Pawn’: Trump’s Immigration Fight With California Squeezes Those Caught in the Middle,"Farmworkers packed a bin while harvesting radicchio in Merced, Calif., last year. California employers and their employees are caught in the middle of a battle over immigrant workers.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/us/immigration-california-trump-sessions.html,2018-03-08T19:08:32Z,"Employers are now bearing the brunt of the Trump administration’s wrath against California and illegal immigration more broadly; ICE’s chief, Thomas D. Homan, has vowed more workplace enforcement and warned that the state had better “hold on tight.” At the same time, those companies now have to follow the state’s Immigrant Worker Protection Act, which took effect Jan. 1. The law prohibits companies from cooperating with ICE without a subpoena, and from letting ICE agents into nonpublic areas. It also requires them to post notices alerting workers that ICE will be reviewing records — a tip-off to those who may not be legally allowed to work. Any company found violating the law faces fines of $2,000 to $10,000. Several workplaces visited by ICE have lost workers, or customers, since it began targeting businesses in late January, and before the audits were even completed. Agriculture, a state economic powerhouse, has been especially hard hit. When Bee Sweet Citrus, a large grower and shipper of oranges, lemons and grapefruit in Fowler, in Central California, plastered on the wall an advisory about ICE’s inspection plans, the company lost some packers, sorters and administrators, one employee said. “I resigned out of fear,” said the worker, Ana, who asked that her last name be withheld because she is undocumented. She said she hung on until Feb. 16, close to the deadline for the company to submit paperwork to ICE, so she could make another month’s rent. (The company said it was complying with state and federal laws regarding the ICE audit, but declined to comment further.) Faith in the Valley, an advocacy group based in Fresno, said it has received a spate of calls from workers rattled after seeing the notices about audits. Manuel Cunha, the president of Nisei Farmers League, a growers’ organization, said, “I have never seen workers quit like this before.” “There is fear and hysteria,” he said. Rooting out illegal labor is, of course, the main purpose of ICE’s workplace visits, which usually involve inspections of companies’ I-9 forms, the federal document on which employees attest they are citizens or otherwise legal workers. (The California law does not require subpoenas for I-9 inspections.) California farmers are heavily dependent on immigrant labor, both legal and illegal, and often contend that they have no way of knowing when a worker submits a fake Social Security number on their I-9 forms. ICE has also stepped up activity in urban areas, conducting sweeps and delivering audit notices to hundreds of businesses in San Francisco, Oakland and Los Angeles. Reyna Guardado, the owner of El Guanaquito Pupuseria, a restaurant in Riverside County, said that all of her workers are family members with green cards or citizenship. But the moment a pair of agents, donning flak jackets emblazoned with “ICE,” set foot there to serve her an I-9 audit notice, her patrons dispersed. “Everybody knows ICE was here,” she said. Also in a bind are law enforcement agencies prohibited by another new state law from cooperating with ICE unless the federal agency has a warrant or the case involves a major crime. Even before the law, many of the state’s largest agencies, like the Los Angeles and San Francisco Police Departments, limited their work with ICE. But agencies in more conservative areas have had to change their practices. The California State Sheriffs’ Association was one of the most vocal opponents of the law. “What used to happen is that I would hand someone off while they were in custody, ICE would escort them out and they would be gone,” said Sheriff Donny Youngblood of Kern County, who was president of the association last year. “Now we have to turn them loose.” Last year, before the law took effect, the Orange County Sheriff’s Department turned over about 370 undocumented immigrants from county custody to federal authorities, said Sheriff Sandra Hutchens. “Now those people are going back into the community,” Sheriff Hutchens said. “We haven’t had any horrible incident that has occurred yet, but when that happens, the community is going to say to me, ‘Why were they released?’” The Trump administration argues that the state laws shield dangerous criminals from federal law enforcement at the expense of public safety. In his speech Wednesday announcing his lawsuit, Mr. Sessions cited the case of a 34-year-old undocumented immigrant arrested in Ventura County on a charge of sexual abuse of a minor. The man, Jose Vaca, left jail and has disappeared, the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office told local news media, because the new state law forbids jails to turn inmates over to ICE until they have appeared before a judge. Mr. Vaca posted bail and was released before his first court appearance, the sheriff’s office said. The state’s Democratic leaders have argued that their new law regarding law enforcement cooperation with ICE keeps communities safe by maintaining trust between the police and immigrant residents. After President Trump took office, the police departments in Los Angeles and other American cities said domestic violence reports from the Hispanic community dropped, which they feared was because victims who were undocumented were afraid of coming forward. The law on employer cooperation helps immigrant workers learn their rights and seek legal help if necessary, its supporters say. “The law works first and foremost to protect Californians’ privacy at the workplace,” said Sarah Lovenheim, a spokeswoman for Xavier Becerra, the Democratic state attorney general. She said she could not divulge whether the office had received any complaints about companies violating the law. Mr. Poindexter, the walnut processor, said he considers himself fortunate that the audit came after the harvest. But his plant operates year-round, and he is eager for ICE to finish its work so he can replace the lost workers before the fall harvest. “There is no point in hiring people with this cloud hanging over us,” he said. Some business owners even wondered if California’s attempts to protect undocumented immigrants were having the opposite effect. “I don’t think the state is helping employers or workers; they are making it worse,” said Karen Musson, who owns Gar Tootelian, a fertilizer retailer that serves 1,500 growers in Fresno County. “We are attracting ICE agents because California drew a line in the sand.” Continue reading the main story",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But the experts are divided about whether the accumulated evidence is enough for Mr. Mueller to bring an obstruction case. About that Michael Wolff book: “Fire and Fury” is to go on sale today, ahead of schedule — and despite legal threats from Mr. Trump. Photo So a steady drip of excerpts — from Steve Bannon calling a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russians “treasonous” to the former adviser suggesting that money laundering charges were in the offing — is about to become a flood. The most damaging may be the book’s descriptions of Mr. Trump’s erratic behavior and of aides’ private contempt for their boss. Many Washington reads are underway (you start in the index, looking for your name). The firestorm has also propelled Mr. Wolff from local media gadfly into national newsmaker. The fallout for Mr. Bannon: Rebekah Mercer, the adviser’s longtime benefactor, disavowed him in a rare public statement. And Breitbart’s board members have debated whether to oust him as the media organization’s chairman, according to the WSJ, citing unnamed sources.

20,The Orange Is the Apple of My Eye,But the miraculous citrus is falling on hard times in Florida.,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-orange-is-the-apple-of-my-eye-1521761258,2018-03-22T23:27:40Z,"Boca Raton, Fla. Florida, which typically produces more than 70% of America’s citrus supply, may have lost about 70% of its crop this season. That would make 2018 the worst year for Florida’s citrus crop in decades. Hurricane Irma decimated citrus groves as it tore through the state last year, and citrus production in Florida had already declined roughly 50% during the five years prior to Irma. What’s going on? First, consider how the orange made its way into the American kitchen. The notion of drinking oranges was an alien concept at the beginning of the 20th century. Then the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918 struck, claiming some 675,000 American lives. Parents were primed for dietary solutions to stave off future scourges. The citrus industry responded by advancing often exaggerated claims of orange juice’s tonic effects. Demand began to spike in the 1930s, bolstered by enthusiasm for the newly identified Vitamin C and the industry’s ingenious “Drink an Orange” ad campaign. Throughout the 20th century the industry continued responding to, and even shaping, the capricious demands of consumers. Frozen concentrate orange juice, developed soon after World War II, promised to save housewives hours of domestic labor. Readers of a certain age will remember teasing the frozen mass out of cylindrical containers with a wooden spoon. When tastes shifted in the late 1980s—from laboratory-spawned products to “fresh” foods—the industry began advertising “not from concentrate” juice. Since those halcyon days, natural calamities like canker and greening have proved costly. Yet nutritionists and pediatricians may represent the greatest threat today. Sugar has replaced fat as the dominant bugaboo in America’s perennial obsessiveness over what foods to avoid. Orange juice—along with other fruit juices and sodas—has become a target. Even so, in a time of heavily processed, powdered protein drinks and souped-up “water,” I still put my faith in actual food. That includes fresh-squeezed orange juice. While I’ve lived in Florida most of my adult life, I was raised in California’s San Fernando Valley, that other orange mecca. Surviving trees from a defunct grove could be found in backyards across my subdivision. I remember my father picking oranges from our trees. I can still taste on my tongue the impossibly sweet, sun-warmed juice. I can’t be the only one concerned that an increasing amount of the orange juice Americans consume might be sourced in Brazil and Mexico rather than Florida and California. If there’s one thing the U.S. ought not to outsource, it’s the food supply. Shoppers who wish to support U.S. growers ought to read those labels carefully at the supermarket and shell out a bit more money for domestic juice. I think it seemed a miracle to my parents, hailing from frigid Pennsylvania, that they could raise their own citrus trees and pick oranges to juice and enjoy over their breakfast. It sure seemed like a miracle to me, and it still does. Mr. Furman, a professor at Florida Atlantic University, is the author of “Goldens Are Here,” forthcoming from Green Writers Press.

21,"Next Year, There Will BeNo Mushy Tomatoes on Your Burger, Says Wendy's","By shifting to vine-ripened tomatoes grown in greenhouses from those plucked from fields, Wendy’s expects to be able to deliver more ripe—and more flavorful—tomatoes to its restaurants.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/next-year-there-will-beno-mushy-tomatoes-on-your-burger-says-wendys-1528196400,2018-06-05T13:25:01Z,"Wendy’s Co. WEN 0.12% says it wants to make sure no one finds a mushy tomato on one of its burgers anymore. To do so, the chain is shifting its tomato production to vine-ripened tomatoes grown in greenhouses from those plucked from fields. The change comes as the use of fresh ingredients is becoming an increasingly important selling point for fast-food chains. Tomatoes grown in the field for commercial use are usually picked while still green and kept cool as they’re transported across the country to protect them from spoiling and bruising. As a result, they never reach maximum ripeness, said Wendy’s spokeswoman Liliana Esposito. “The biggest complaint you get about a tomato in any restaurant is that it’s orange and translucent in the middle. It doesn’t look like the tomato you’d expect from your backyard,” she said. By largely moving production to the U.S. from Mexico, where Wendy’s currently gets the majority of its tomatoes, and using the more controlled setting of greenhouses, the company says it expects to be able to deliver more ripe—and therefore more flavorful—tomatoes to its restaurants. There are also fewer insects and plant diseases to contend with when tomatoes are grown inside. The greenhouse-grown tomatoes will be available for Wendy’s sandwiches and salads at its more than 6,000 North American restaurants by early next year, the company said. Whether consumers will care about the change in its tomatoes remains to be seen. Although fast-food rivals have been touting the quality and freshness of their food, consumers still want their meals at a low price. McDonald’s and Burger King, a unit of Restaurant Brands International Inc., have been offering low-price food and beverages. McDonald’s sales in the U.S. were weaker than expected in the first quarter but still rose 2.9%, thanks in part to customers adding extra items to their orders from the chain’s new $1, $2, $3 value menu. Burger King, which offers a number of deals, including 10 chicken nuggets for $1.69, posted U.S. same-store sales growth of 4.2% in the first quarter. Wendy’s North American restaurants posted same-store sales growth of 1.6% in the quarter. Some tomato purists say nothing beats the flavor of a tomato grown in the soil. But field-grown tomatoes sold for commercial use are often sprayed with ethylene gas, a plant hormone that occurs naturally in fruit, just before they reach supermarket shelves or restaurants so that they appear ripe. Freezing temperatures in late 2010 and early 2011 in Florida and Mexico were the impetus for Wendy’s decision to bring tomato production indoors, according to Ms. Esposito. The unusually cold winter led to a nationwide tomato shortage, and many restaurants, including Wendy’s, o nly served tomatoes upon request. Wendy’s said it has been shifting to vine-ripened tomatoes grown in greenhouses ever since and has finally built up enough growers—a dozen in all—to supply all of its restaurants in North America. “When you can control the environment, you’re going to have a much more consistent tomato,” said Dennis Hecker, Wendy’s senior vice president of quality assurance. The world’s third largest burger chain has in recent years been launching summer salads made with fresh berries and has long prided itself on serving beef patties that have never been frozen. McDonald’s last month began making all of its quarter-pound burgers in the contiguous U.S. with fresh, rather than frozen, beef. McDonald’s said none of its tomatoes are grown in greenhouses. Burger King didn’t respond to a request seeking comment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,Wall Street's Marijuana Madness: 'It's Like the Internet in 1997',"Entrepreneurs and investors are rushing headlong into the nascent legal marijuana industry, fueling a stock craze reminiscent of the late 1990s dot-com bubble and the recent bitcoin mania.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-streets-marijuana-madness-its-like-the-internet-in-1997-1537718400,2018-09-23T16:00:03Z,"TORONTOShannon Soqui just quit his Wall Street job to go after what he thinks is a bigger business: selling marijuana the way Mary Kay Inc. sells cosmetics. The 51-year-old banker wants to focus on Qind, his San Francisco startup that organizes home parties to sell cannabis products, to get a piece of what he says could sprout into a $100 billion annual business in the U.S. Its like the internet in 1997 or 1998, said Mr. Soqui. Investment opportunities to create new businesses have never been more compelling. Entrepreneurs and investors are rushing headlong into the nascent legal marijuana industry, fueling a stock craze reminiscent of the late 1990s dot-com bubble and the recent bitcoin mania. Big companies, wealthy families and amateurs alike are taking stakes in speculative companies, many of which have scant revenue or history. Tilray Inc., TLRY -30.25% which grows marijuana in Canada and is one of just a few pot companies listed in the U.S., had its stock halted multiple times on Wednesday, after announcing it had received permission to export a small amount of cannabis to California for a medical study. Because it is difficult to gain approval to bring cannabis from abroad into the U.S., where it hasnt been legalized under federal law, Tilrays announcement suggested it had gained an advantage over other suppliers. The companys share price more than doubled between Monday and Wednesday, nearing $300 before plunging Friday to end the week at $123, after a lawmaker questioned the decision to allow a Canadian company to supply marijuana for the study. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R., Fla.) said the federal government should give the license to an American company instead. A Tilray spokeswoman declined to comment. Canada has become a hotbed for the cannabis industry because it is one of only two countries, along with Uruguay, that has legalized recreational marijuana use. Starting Oct. 17, Canadians will be able to buy pot from licensed vendors across the country. In the U.S., the use, sale or possession of marijuana is illegal under federal law, though 30 states permit medical use and nine states allow recreational use. Federal restrictions make it more difficult for U.S. cannabis companies to make financial transactions, and markets such as the Nasdaq and Toronto Stock Exchange refuse to list companies that have any federally unsanctioned U.S. business, leading many to list on other lightly regulated Canadian markets.

Many of these companies are so new they are still developing business plans. Investors took notice last year when Constellation Brands Inc., whose stable of products includes Corona and Modelo beer, sank nearly $200 million into Canopy Growth Corp. CGC -5.00%, one of Canadas biggest marijuana growers. In August, the beverage group raised its bet on Canopy, investing an additional $4 billion. Constellations president, Bill Newlands, told investors recently that the company is expanding into cannabis products through Canopy because it believes more countries will open their doors to medicinal or recreational sales, and the global market could be a $200 billion business in very short order. The optimism has grown beyond any reasonable fundamentals, some investors say. Tilray, for example, posted less than $20 million in revenue for the first half of the year. It ended its volatile week with a market value of $11 billion, about the same as Macys Inc., which has almost $25 billion in annual revenue. This will be a global industry, and it will rival alcohol or beverage in the size and scope, Tilray Chief Executive Brendan Kennedy said in an interview. The company expects a new facility in Portugal to begin operating next year. The challenge for us is moving fast enough, Mr. Kennedy said. The pace is faster than even I expected. This is like a gold rush, former Mexican President Vicente Fox said during a recent visit to Toronto to promote Khiron Life Sciences Corp. KHRN 11.92%, a Canadian medical-marijuana company where he serves as a director. Khiron, which reported a net loss of 6.7 million Canadian dollars (US$5.2 million) and no sales for its second quarter, raised C$13 million through a stock sale earlier this month. Jesse Pytlak, a Toronto analyst with Cormark Securities, estimates cannabis stocks are currently valued at more than 10 times the C$5 billion to C$9 billion market expected to emerge in Canada by consulting firm Deloitte after legal recreational sales begin. He warned investors are prematurely deciding which companies will dominate a new market before a single ounce of recreational pot is legally sold in Canada. One lawyer who has advised banks and marijuana companies in recent deals said a shakeout is inevitable. I believe theres a great opportunity for our insolvency lawyers in this industry, said Patricia Olasker, a partner at Toronto-based Davies Ward Phillips &amp; Vineberg LLP. There are going to be lots and lots of failures. As the fervor intensifies, investors have grown indifferent to skimpy records for sales that would normally be viewed as red flags. Shortly after startup Green Organic Dutchman Holdings Ltd. TGOD -6.04% listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange in May, the company carried a market value of C$2.1 billion. A spokesman for the Ontario company said it hasnt yet signed agreements to supply its marijuana in Canada and currently only grows at a small 7,000-square-foot research facility. Our team is confident that there will be shelf space for our organic product, the spokesman said. It hopes to build one million square feet of cultivation space by next year, he said. Some players in Canadas mining and oil-and-gas sectors have reinvented themselves to tap eager cannabis capital. Money has dried up for new oil-and-gas ventures. I had to look at something else, said Craig Kolochuk, a 20-year-veteran of Albertas energy sector. Earlier this year, he helped restructure Relentless Resources Ltd. into a hybrid cannabis and oil-and-gas producer called SugarBud Craft Growers Corp., where he is now CEO. The company has raised about $15 million in stock and rights offerings, and $17 million in debt. Instead of analyzing barrels, were analyzing ounces, he said. Even some of the sectors boosters say the craze is getting ahead of itself. Mr. Soqui, the former Wall Street banker, said some of the companies that have gone public suffer from very weak management, and investors need to be ready for a fall in marijuana prices because too many suppliers have entered the market. Its way oversupplied. You have high valuations that are irrational, he said. —Jennifer Maloney contributed to this article.

23,No Tannenbaum! There's a Christmas-Tree Shortage,"This weekend is the year’s busiest for Christmas-tree shopping and some retailers are running out already. A perfect storm of problems, agricultural and economic, has led to a lack of supply of live trees, and prices are soaring as a result.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-tannenbaum-theres-a-christmas-tree-shortage-1512129600,2017-12-01T12:00:06Z,"It’s barely December and it may already be too late to get a Christmas tree. Jessica Kuchinski found out Tuesday that her months-old order for a 6-foot, $159 fir tree was canceled. Julie Prather’s favorite choose-and-cut lot in the mountains of North Carolina sold out last weekend. Christina Doerfel of Kirkland, Wash., and her family plan to get a $10 permit at an outdoor store and chop down their own tree this weekend in a federal forest, after getting sticker shock over high prices and few choices at local lots. Ms. Kuchinski dragged a plastic tree out of the basement and went in search of an evergreen-scented candle to fill her family’s suburban Denver home. Ms. Prather called a half-dozen more cut-your-own lots in North Carolina and all had low or no inventory. So she is planning to drive five hours from Savannah, Ga., on Friday in search of a tree with no certainty she will find one. “I’m really disappointed,” Ms. Prather said. This Christmas, supplies of live trees are tight. Some Christmas tree lots are closing almost as soon as they open, citing a shortage of trees and presaging a potential national run on firs this weekend, traditionally the busiest of the tree-buying season. Some suppliers blame extreme weather this past year. Some blame changes to agriculture, like small farmers in Oregon, the biggest tree-producing state, turning to grapes and cannabis instead. But most growers blame the Great Recession. It takes seven years to 10 years to grow a tree. Many farmers planted fewer seedlings or went out of business altogether in the years after the housing bust, when consumers pulled back spending. At the same time, total acreage in production declined 30% between 2002 and 2012, according to the latest federal data available. The ensuing tightening of supply started last year and live-tree buyers spent an average of $74.70, more than double the average in 2011, according to the National Christmas Tree Association, a trade association for the live-tree industry. To meet 2016 contracts, some growers cut trees from this year’s crop early, making the 2017 supply even leaner. The lack of supply is being felt most acutely in states including Florida, Arizona and Illinois—those farther from Oregon and North Carolina, which account for 37% and 25%, respectively, of Christmas tree production. Customers are likely to pay at least 10% more than last year for a 5-foot to 7-foot tree, and up to 20% more for a taller tree, said Steve Troxler, agricultural commissioner for North Carolina. (He recently paid $200 for his own 14-foot Fraser fir. “I had to pay my increase in price like everybody else,” he said.) Buyers might have to visit more than one vendor, especially if they are seeking a popular height or a popular variety like Noble or Fraser fir, said Angie Smith, executive director of the Pacific Northwest Christmas Tree Association, which represents growers in Oregon and Washington. Retailers like Home Depot Inc. and Lowe’s Cos. have longstanding contracts with tree growers and should have ample trees for weeks to come, she said. “What people will see are the small retail lots, especially where churches and schools have fundraisers, their supplies are tight,” Ms. Smith said. The industry is sensitive to saying there is a shortage, as it implies there are not enough live trees to meet demand, said Tim O’Connor, spokesman for the national association. “There is a tree for everybody that wants one,” he said, it may just require choosing a different vendor or type of tree. David Gallagher, who has run Gallagher’s Pumpkins &amp; Christmas Trees lot in St. Petersburg, Fla., for 30 years, is telling customers that he could be closed for the season within two weeks. “I have people that always want to wait until a week before Christmas, but I wouldn’t wait,” he said. “Supply is super, super tight.” He said he is holding price increases to 5% to avoid sending people to the competition—what the natural-tree business calls fake trees. For its part, the artificial-tree industry is saying traditionalists should see the shortage as a sign to branch out. Trees can be “tall, short, thin, fat, green, silver, white, ombré, rainbow, upside down, real or artificial,” according to a Facebook post by the American Christmas Tree Association, a trade group for artificial-tree producers. “Don’t be discouraged,” the association said. “That ‘perfect’ Christmas tree is any type of Christmas tree that fits your personality and your lifestyle.” The prospect of higher prices sent Ms. Doerfel, of Kirkland, Wash., in search of alternatives. She and her husband have five children, so the holidays are expensive already and she is hesitant to spend more than $60 on a tree. That is how she came up with the idea of going to the forest to find one. “My husband is not as excited as I am,” she said. “But I think it’s super fun. Just slap a tree on a sled and drag it back.” She is trying to adjust expectations for her children, ages 4 to 18, who are used to picking a Christmas-card worthy tree at a lot with hot cocoa and tractor rides. “What’s that kind of tree that’s a lot more thin, where the branches are more spread out, a ‘Charlie Brown’ tree?” she said. “I’m going into it knowing it’s not going to be picture-perfect.” Karen Van Buskirk of southern Illinois went tree shopping last weekend with hopes of staying close to her traditional budget of $15. Normally it is sufficient for a Douglas fir. The tree she and her husband chose already had green paint sprayed on its branches to keep it looking fresh. They paid $39, more than twice her budget. She is hosting her 28-year-old daughter and extended family this weekend for tree-trimming, homemade cookies and the traditional placement of a Precious Moments angel on the top of the tree. “I’ll make sloppy joes and she and I will put the lights on,” Ms. Van Buskirk said. “It’s having family together, without their phones, and there’s this pride in it. You can say, ‘Look at what we’ve done.’ “ Write to Valerie Bauerlein at valerie.bauerlein@wsj.com",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,"U.S. Christmas tree shortage threatens to raise prices, hurt selection for B.C. shoppers","For growers in Eastern and Central Canada, however, the shortage is turning into an exporting boon",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/us-christmas-tree-shortage-threatens-prices-selection-for-bc-shoppers/article37134730/,2017-11-30T00:59:50Z,"The scramble to get a beautiful Christmas tree has started. And it's likely going to be roughest in British Columbia. While a shortage of Christmas trees in the United States is turning into an exporting boon for growers in Eastern and Central Canada, B.C. shoppers are expected to face stiffer prices and a more dismal selection of evergreens. ""People may not be able to buy the choice of trees they want,"" said Art Loewen, whose business, Pine Meadows Tree Farms in Chilliwack, supplies local garden centres. ""There will be enough trees, but they might not get the choice they want."" Story continues below advertisement But for Canadian growers, who suffered through a dark period seven years ago, when they faced a glut of trees from U.S. producers, things have rebounded. This fall's orders were exceptional, said Jimmy Downey, whose family farm, Sapinière Downey, is located in Hatley, in Quebec's Eastern Townships, an area southeast of Montreal that exports 85 per cent of its fir trees to the United States. This is the first year that most of Mr. Downey's sales were finalized many months before workers started cutting the trees. ""We try to run after our clients. This year, it was the opposite. The clients were running after us to get their trees,"" said Mr. Downey, who is president of growers' group the Association des producteurs d'arbres de Noël du Québec. ""It seems to be a really good year. We are selling to the max,"" said Shirley Brennan, executive director of the Canadian Christmas Tree Growers Association. The scarcity in the United States is, however, a concern in B.C., which relies on U.S. imports. Other parts of Canada are not expected to be affected and big chains such as Loblaw and IKEA said they will be properly supplied for the holiday season. The problem south of the border has been attributed to a delayed result of the recession that began in 2007. There were fewer sales, less harvesting and, as a result, U.S. growers planted fewer new trees, which need a decade to mature into adequate size. Mr. Downey said he had been getting more orders from Washington State, where dry conditions might have affected the tree crops. ""You end up with [what] we call a Charlie Brown tree … you only see a few needles and a trunk and branches. It's not appearing green, it won't give a nice smell in the house, it's not marketable."" Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement B.C. relies on imports from the United States as its limited agricultural land has pushed farmers toward higher-value crops, said Mr. Loewen, an executive with the B.C. Christmas Tree Council. ""We've never grown enough of our own and we've always imported a lot from the U.S. That has become tougher,"" he said. His business is growing fewer firs because he can't rent additional acreages any more. He has had to buy more trees from U.S. suppliers to keep up with the demand, but their prices have gone up. For example, noble firs that he used to buy for $30 or less a unit now cost $50 wholesale. In addition to higher prices, he said that instead of Fraser or balsam firs, retailers might have to sell grand firs, which don't keep their needles as well, Mr. Loewen said. In Nova Scotia, booming demand for real trees in the United States has many growers uncertain of whether they can cut enough trees this December to keep up with wholesale demand. Story continues below advertisement The province's Christmas tree industry is large and in the midst of a rebound after going through ""a rough period,"" said Angus Bonnyman, executive director of the Nova Scotia Christmas Tree Council. Increasingly, big-box retailers in both Canada and the United States have been turning to Nova Scotia growers to pick up the slack from large U.S. growers, he said. Whether that will translate into shortages and higher prices at retail tree lots is not yet clear. ""There should be a tree for everyone. We wouldn't want folks to panic,"" Mr. Bonnyman said, while suggesting in the same breath that shoppers buy their trees early. Mr. Bonnyman said there aren't reliable statistics on the number of trees sent to the United States versus other provinces, where trees are commonly given new tags of origin and sold again. Growers in Nova Scotia are independent and often family-owned; they are not compelled to disclose sales data. Even growers who supply the Canadian domestic market feel the pressure from a tree-starved U.S. market. Cindy Rhodenizer, who runs G.A.R. Tree Farms with her husband in Nova Scotia's Lunenburg County, supplies one main client, a big-box retailer with stores across Canada. She said she is routinely asked whether she can sell to the United States.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,When Is It Safe to Eat Salad Again?,An outbreak of infections linked to bagged romaine lettuce has left salad lovers confused. Here are answers to common questions about leafy greens.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/19/well/eat/romaine-lettuce-salad-food-poisoning-e-coli.html,2018-04-19T20:05:31Z,"“Are you really supposed to say to the waiter who serves you Caesar salad, ‘Can you tell me where the romaine lettuce was obtained?’” said Jean Halloran, director of food policy initiatives for Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports. “It’s completely unreasonable and unrealistic to think consumers may be able to sort out whether the romaine they eat at a restaurant or buy at a store comes from Yuma, Ariz., or someplace else. The prudent thing to do at this point is to avoid all romaine.” So why is this outbreak so serious, and when can we safely eat Caesar salad again? Here are answers to some of your most pressing questions about leafy greens and food safety. What’s so special about Arizona? Here’s a little salad trivia for you. Most of the bagged romaine grown in North America for grocery stores and restaurants comes from Salinas Valley in California. But in late fall and winter, the industry moves to Yuma, Ariz. Given the time frame of the outbreak, it’s pretty clear that the infected romaine must have come from Yuma, but other than that, little is known about the source of the outbreak. It’s most likely from an animal (cow, deer or wild pig). It could have come from an animal defecating in a field or water runoff contaminated with E. coli. The good news is that this month, most of the industry’s bagged romaine production has shifted back to California. However, it’s likely that Yuma-sourced bagged romaine is still in the food supply. When can I start eating bagged romaine again? Lettuce has a short shelf life and a lot of retailers have taken bagged romaine off shelves. “Hopefully with it being in one particular growing region and that region moving to California, it won’t be too much longer,” said Laura Gieraltowski, who leads the C.D.C.’s food-borne outbreak response team. That said, she urged consumers to wait for the all-clear from the C.D.C. before eating chopped romaine. “It’s a fast-moving outbreak,” she said. “We’re getting reports of new illness daily from our state and local health departments.” Why is this outbreak so worrisome? Escherichia coli is in our intestines, the environment, foods and animals, but most of the time it doesn’t make you sick. However, this particular strain — Shiga toxin-producing E. coli 0157:H7 — is particularly dangerous. The symptoms vary but can include severe stomach cramps, bloody diarrhea and vomiting. While the people affected range in age from 10 to 85 years, the median age is 34 — meaning the bug is making otherwise healthy, strong people really sick. The hospitalization rate for E. coli illness is typically around 30 percent, but this strain has put 67 percent of the cases in the hospital. Five people have developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure. Given delays in reporting, those numbers are expected to grow. The other concern is that unlike a recent multistate outbreak of salmonella in eggs, which resulted in a recall of a specific egg product, no specific grower, supplier or brand has been identified as the source of the romaine outbreak. Where has the outbreak occurred? Infections linked to the outbreak have been found in 16 states, illustrating how widely bags of romaine are distributed around the country. You can find a list of states where cases have been reported on the C.D.C. website. Most of the reported cases have come from Pennsylvania (12), Idaho (10), New Jersey (7), Montana (6) and Arizona (3). New York, Connecticut, Ohio and Michigan have had two cases each, with one case each in Alaska, California, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, Virginia and Washington state. How do I know if the greens I’m eating contain romaine? Most people can’t reliably distinguish romaine from other forms of lettuce, Ms. Halloran said. A head of romaine lettuce is more oblong than the round shape typical of iceberg. “It’s the one with the pointy football shape,” Ms. Halloran said. “When it’s chopped up you’re not going to see that. It’s a bit crunchier and chewier than bibb lettuce. The outer leaves are dark green and the inner leaves are yellow so color isn’t going to tell you. If you’ve had Caesar salad you’ve almost certainly had romaine lettuce.” Why does the C.D.C. say it’s O.K. to eat heads and hearts of romaine, but not bagged? The documented cases have been linked to bagged romaine eaten at home or in restaurants, not full heads or hearts of lettuce. The lettuce at the source of the outbreak is grown in Arizona for bagged use. The C.D.C. suggests that the contamination is limited to some part of the bagged lettuce supply chain. Will washing my lettuce lower my risk? It only takes a few cells of E. coli to make you sick, so while washing produce lowers the risk, it doesn’t eliminate it entirely. If you have bagged romaine lettuce, throw it away; washing it is no guarantee that you will get rid of the toxins. And while the C.D.C. recommends washing all produce with water, including heads of lettuce, it does not recommend washing other forms of bagged lettuce, which has already been washed before bagging. “Your chances of contaminating it in your kitchen” — with contaminants that may already be on your kitchen countertop, hands or elsewhere — “are actually higher than if you didn’t wash the salad greens,” notes Dr. Gieraltowski. If you’re preparing a head of lettuce, you may consider taking extra steps to clean it, such as discarding the outer leaves and washing the inner leaves. “If I buy a full head of lettuce in a store, I know a lot of different people have been touching it,” says Juan Leon, associate professor of global health and food safety expert at Emory University. What is the best way to wash produce? Most of the time rinsing produce under running water is sufficient. Commercial fruit and vegetable washes are mostly water and haven’t been shown to be more effective than water alone, say several experts. Some people use white vinegar or even a light bleach solution, but the C.D.C. and food safety experts say there’s no evidence that will lower risk, and at the risk of stating the obvious, it’s generally a bad idea to use bleach in home food preparation. Dr. Leon says to use common sense. Don’t hold a baby while preparing food. Wash hands before handling produce. Don’t handle meat and produce in the same spot. Take extra care with produce that has a rough surface. “Rough surfaces like to capture pathogens,” Dr. Leon said. He uses a produce brush to scrub fruits and vegetables and cleans the brush in the dishwasher. Note that certain foods — sprouts, herbs like parsley and cilantro, raspberries and melons — are more at risk for becoming contaminated with pathogens like E. coli. He always scrubs the outside of a cantaloupe before cutting it with a knife. Produce that is eaten raw presents an increased risk; the heat of cooking can lower the risk. Dr. Leon also notes that the simple choice of eating at home can lower risk. “When you eat in is when you have the most control,” he said. “When you eat out you lose control not only of the produce being used but all the other steps of people handling and cooking for you, the water, the cleanliness. There are a lot more things that can go wrong.” Is it safer to buy leafy greens and produce at a farmers’ market? Big growers are subject to more health regulations than small farms. At the same time, there are fewer steps from farm to table when you buy from a small grower. “We don’t know the answer,” says LeeAnn Jaykus, professor of food microbiology at North Carolina State University. “You don’t have regulations that are forcing those farmers to adhere to certain practices. At the same time, a lot of them do, and they are doing much smaller agriculture so they have greater control of what they are doing.” If I can’t have my usual Caesar salad with romaine, what should I eat? Ilene Rosen, author of the new book “Saladish” and chef and co-owner of R&amp;D Foods, a specialty food store in Brooklyn, said she uses seasonal greens from local farms and currently romaine is not on the menu. Mustard greens, kale and dandelion greens are en route from Lancaster, Pa. A lentil salad includes diced fennel, green tomatoes and sunflower sprouts. The point of “Saladish” is that salad is more than just leafy greens. “There can be grains and protein, a whole wide range of things including international condiments,” she said. “Salads can combine so many more things than greens and dressing.” Continue reading the main story",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An initial public offering for The Green Organic Dutchman Holdings Ltd. is being marketed by a group of investment banks led by Canaccord Genuity Group Inc., with a goal of closing the deal and listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange in March. The company operates a small production facility near Hamilton and holds one of 90 licences in this country – and one of 48 in Ontario – that have been issued by Health Canada to cultivate marijuana plants for medical use. The IPO filing comes months ahead of Ottawa's legalization of the drug for recreational use, a move that will allow growers to serve millions of consumers instead of just thousands of patients who are allowed to buy their products today. Investors have been trading pot stocks at a dizzying pace in anticipation of rapid growth in revenue and profitability, pushing up valuations in the sector amid wild swings in share prices. Story continues below advertisement The choppy market conditions have made it more difficult for cannabis firms to price stock sales and size up potential acquisitions. Late last year and in early January, pot stocks soared to extraordinary levels as trading volumes spiked. The Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences ETF, an exchange-traded fund that tracks the sector, went up 102 per cent in the last three months of 2017 and another 6.7 per cent in January. But the past month has seen a vicious correction. Nearly all of the three dozen public cannabis stocks tracked by investment firm Echelon Wealth Partners Inc. have tumbled over the month ended Feb. 22, plunging by an average of 24 per cent. Shares of the largest company, Canopy Growth Corp., have lost one-third of their value since hitting a new high on Jan. 9. Still, the average three-month return of the cannabis firms tracked by Echelon is 52 per cent – meaning big gains for those who got in early enough. The Green Organic Dutchman, or TGOD as it's known in the industry, will join a crowded field by going public. It's not clear how much money the company hopes to raise in the offering. Company executives declined to comment. The company is young, hasn't generated any revenue and has incurred losses of $10-million, according to a preliminary prospectus filed earlier this month. Yet it has more than 4,000 investors, according to its website, having raised $160-million in private capital since 2016 to improve its Hamilton facility and push into Quebec. TGOD recently secured the backing of Aurora Cannabis Inc., which is fiercely competing with rival Canopy to be the largest cannabis firm by market capitalization. Aurora acquired an 18-per-cent stake in TGOD last month for $55-million, buying subscription receipts at $1.65 apiece. Each receipt will convert to a unit when TGOD goes public, which has to occur before July 31. Otherwise, TGOD will have to cancel the receipts and repay Aurora. One unit is worth one common share and one-half of a warrant. The warrants have an exercise price of $3 a share and expire nearly three years from the date the company goes public. As part of the deal, Aurora can bolster its stake to more than 50 per cent if The Green Organic Dutchman achieves certain milestones. Aurora also has the right to buy at least 20 per cent of the cannabis produced by TGOD each year. By 2022, TGOD expects to grow 116,000 kilograms of marijuana a year, according to the prospectus. Today, its Hamilton facility has room for just 1,000 kg of product and the company has decided to use any of the cannabis it has harvested for research and product development. Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement The company bills itself as one of only three producers that grow ""organic"" cannabis that is free of pesticides and fertilizers that can be harmful when heated. But it remains to be seen if that pitch will resonate with customers. TGOD has a limited operating history. In its prospectus, the company includes consolidated financial statements audited by Deloitte LLP for less than two months to Dec. 31, 2016, as well as selected audited annual data from 2014 to 2016. It offers unaudited results for the first nine months of 2017 to Sept. 30. The company is also warning that it has identified ""a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting"" that could result in a material misstatement of its results not being ""prevented or detected in a timely basis."" It said that it didn't have effective controls over ""the analysis of contracts and transactions, review of manual journal entries, reconciliation of balance-sheet accounts and tracking of property, plant and equipment."" TGOD says that it is working to address these deficiencies, aided by a newly minted director and audit-committee head, Nicholas Kirton, who is also the chair of the Canadian Investor Protection Fund. The federal government now says legal marijuana won’t be available for sale before August. Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor says once the Senate holds a final vote by June 7, provinces will need eight to 12 weeks to prepare.

28,An Entrepreneur With Autism Finds His Own Path,"For Chris Tidmarsh, the key is building a support network to help execute his vision",https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-entrepreneur-with-autism-finds-his-own-path-1511752381,2017-11-27T04:12:13Z,"Chris Tidmarsh co-owns Green Bridge Growers, a commercial greenhouse in north central Indiana that provides herbs, lettuces and nasturtiums to local restaurants, and sunflowers and cosmos to florists. He has degrees in chemistry, environmental studies and French. He has a passion for agriculture. He also fits a very rare profile for an entrepreneur. He has autism. The 30-year-old created the company in 2013 with his mother—and co-owner— Jan Pilarski, after a promising job as an environmental researcher ended abruptly because he had difficulties communicating. That left him with the choice of either trying to find a more suitable job or, with the help of his family, creating a business that would capitalize on his skills. They chose the latter. “My mom does most of the administration,” says Mr. Tidmarsh, including accounting, marketing and sales. He perfects the spacing between rows of kale and spinach, and keeps close tabs on water chemistry and soil acidity. He spends hours researching natural and effective pesticides to deal with aphids. The solution: 4,500 ladybugs. Ms. Pilarski often explains how they created and run the business to groups of parents whose children have autism, to show that it is possible. “There is a deep, deep need for hope and jobs,” she says. A network of support In many ways, Mr. Tidmarsh’s path to entrepreneurship resembles that of others starting their own business. He has a wide breadth of knowledge and a vision of what he wants to accomplish. He is a mentor to those working alongside him. The results are promising. Green Bridge is projecting revenue of $80,000 and profit of $30,000 in fiscal year 2018. In fiscal 2020, when an expansion is complete, it expects to reach $220,000 in revenue and $72,000 in profit. In other ways, though, his journey is very different. Other entrepreneurs may know what they can’t handle and delegate those tasks to others. But they know how to execute their vision. That is difficult for Mr. Tidmarsh. He has a dream but leans on his mother and a network of supporters to plot and fulfill it. It is a story shared by many other entrepreneurs with autism spectrum disorder, a condition affecting about one in 68 children and 1% to 2% of the overall population in the U.S. Starting a successful business is no small task for anyone, but those on the autism spectrum face challenges that others don’t. Many have difficulties with executive functioning—the ability to follow multiple steps to complete a task. They may also have a limited ability to follow rules of social interaction—like maintaining eye contact or shaking hands—or to read facial expressions to let them know what someone might be feeling or thinking. Sometimes they can type what is in their head, but are unable to say it. They know how to work, explains Danny Raede, chief executive of the Asperger Experts online community, who was diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome, an autism-spectrum disorder, at age 12. But “their brains won’t let them.” So, jobs are few for people on the spectrum, and adults with the condition have an estimated 80% to 90% unemployment rate. “One of the ways people choose to address this is by creating a business that allows them to be self-employed,” says Angela Geiger, CEO of Autism Speaks, an advocacy and support organization, which has a business-accelerator program. By launching their own companies, people on the spectrum can create a work environment that fits their comfort level and doesn’t force them to navigate the traditional, heavily social office setting. Very often, though, their key to success is not to try for independence, but to build up a network of supporters who will help them with the business. “It’s how interdependent can you get,” says Mr. Raede. “Try to get as many people you can rely on, not one. I want to have 10,000 people I know and can rely on.” His online community is built on that concept, offering support groups and online courses to facilitate learning on a mass scale. One of the best ways those supporters can help someone on the spectrum become self employed is to identify and build on their skills instead of trying to change behavior or have them do something they can’t, says Cary Griffin, co-founder of Griffin-Hammis Associates, a Florence, Mont., consulting firm that specializes in developing self-employment opportunities for people with disabilities. If a person can’t manage bookkeeping or marketing, for instance, others can. Often, it’s a parent or sibling. When Matt Cottle, 28, of Phoenix learned that he couldn’t be a Marine like his father and brother because he was on the spectrum, he took culinary classes and began working with a pastry chef. Many people on the spectrum, in fact, are chefs, along with craftsmen, locksmiths and candle makers. Mr. Cottle found his vocation in baking and started Stuttering King Bakery, which supplies muffins and scones to local coffee shops, corporate events and farmers markets. He is licensed and works out of a large kitchen in the home he shares with his parents. His mother, Peg, handles orders and marketing. “For someone on the spectrum to be able to make it, they really have to have someone else who has a real high investment in their success, and usually that is going to be family,” says Ms. Cottle. Approaching the puzzle Mr. Tidmarsh, the oldest of four children, was diagnosed with autism as a preschooler, when a caregiver noted that he seemed in his own world and uninterested in family members coming and leaving the house. Since he was their first child, Ms. Pilarski says that she and her husband, Jay, likely missed the significance of behavior that might have concerned more-experienced parents. For most of his childhood and teen years, the couple focused on the most immediate next step—elementary school, middle school, high school and college—while also raising their other three children and working. Jay Tidmarsh teaches law at the University of Notre Dame, and Jan ran a social-justice program at St. Mary’s College. Chris Tidmarsh received his three degrees from Hope College, a small liberal-arts school in Holland, Mich. After graduating in 2010, he got a job as an environmental researcher. But it didn’t last. “I was doing a lot of office work and behind the computer. I’m not the best with that style. They generally communicate verbally, and I’m more of a visual learner,” says Mr. Tidmarsh, who struggles at times to find and say the right word. He’s better at following directions when they are written in emails and texts. It is harder when they are spoken. After three months, he was let go. “I felt disappointed, and I guess I felt kind of sad that it didn’t work out, but I was looking forward to finding a job that I might enjoy more,” Mr. Tidmarsh says. Back at home, his parents saw him surrounded by peers with degrees and on the spectrum, and likewise unemployed. The reality of the obstacles facing their son and his limited options loomed large. It wasn’t so much the idea of his son earning money that concerned Jay Tidmarsh. “I wasn’t stressed that way,” he says. “It was hard for us to have this young man with a lot of ability unable to use it. That was really concerning. I really believe in the importance of work. It’s a part of who you are.” Over many meals, Chris Tidmarsh and his family talked about what he loved doing most. He interned at an organic farm, became a master gardener and took a class designed to help people become farmers. “I’ve been really interested in the environment and Earth for a long time,” Mr. Tidmarsh says. “I decided I wanted to do something related to that.” He and his mother, who grew up on a farm, began researching options. They visited a software business set up by the family of a young man on the spectrum, and talked at length about how they made it viable. They also visited several farms, including one that used an aquaponics process, where fish’s waste is used to fertilize plants that grow in water, while the plants clean the water to cycle it back to the fish tank. That process, heavily dependent on chemistry and environmentally friendly, captured Mr. Tidmarsh’s attention. “It requires a bit of knowledge of chemistry,” he says. “It is very sustainable. It uses 90% less water than growing in the soil.” The plan emerges From there, mother and son began working together to figure out how to get the business off the ground. Ms. Pilarski left her job in 2012 and applied to a program through her alma mater, Notre Dame, designed to help startup social enterprises. Part of the class involved creating a plan that could be entered into a business-plan competition at Notre Dame’s Mendoza Business School. She and Mr. Tidmarsh laid out their strategy with the help of four graduate students. Among other crucial choices, they decided to set up the business as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, and have a key component of its mission be training others with autism. When the group presented the plan to the competition judges, Mr. Tidmarsh spoke about unemployment problems faced by people on the autism spectrum and described his own experience. They won the social-impact prize, which provided $15,000 as well as legitimacy. “It really took us to a different place and acknowledged the viability of what we were doing,” says Ms. Pilarski. The team met with area farm-to-table restaurant owners and a local Whole Foods Market to determine market potential and realized that it was huge: Indiana trucks in 90% of its food, they discovered. They researched profit margins and decided to focus on those products that have the highest ones, like basil, which sells for $16 a pound retail and $10.50 wholesale. In 2013, the partners built a prototype for their business, located on a site in South Bend, Ind., that housed an agency serving people with disabilities. As they produced their first crops—along with basil, they grew cilantro, red Russian kale, lettuce, mint and parsley—they learned the ins and outs of the growing process. Mr. Tidmarsh focused on monitoring the details of the fish tanks and the level of nutrients the plants were getting. The next step in their plan was expansion. Guided by the board they had set up for the nonprofit, they raised money through donors and a crowdfunding campaign, which they added to a $10,000 entrepreneur-of-the-year award won by Mr. Tidmarsh. Finding land that met zoning regulations and offered access to water and electricity, and room for growth, was more difficult than they envisioned. “It took a tremendous amount of time,” says Mr. Tidmarsh. After more than a year, in December 2014, they found a farm with 5 acres, a house and barn, and bought it for $70,000. Ms. Pilarski scouted for other funding sources to cover the cost, landing grants from a utility and the U.S. Agriculture Department. All was progressing until March 2016—when Ms. Pilarski was diagnosed with cancer. It wasn’t only a personal blow, but also a tremendous setback for the business. She was the one calling contractors, pricing materials and looking for the best suppliers. She did as much as she could for as long as she could, but “it was difficult to keep the momentum going,” she says. Mr. Tidmarsh struggled with the disruption. He says little but nods in agreement as Ms. Pilarski tells her story and concludes, “I’m back and healthy.” In the midst of those difficult times, their support network helped keep the business moving forward. Board members pitched in when and how they could, as did Jay Tidmarsh. While caregiver to his wife during her 10-month treatment, he and volunteers started building two now-complete greenhouses on the new property. Once the growing facilities are fully operational, the family expects to harvest about 45,000 pounds of produce a year. Having both parents involved in the business, says Chris Tidmarsh, “brought us closer.” The way forward The business has provided a path forward for Mr. Tidmarsh and his family. He says that he has become more comfortable conducting tours of the greenhouse. He has also addressed large audiences, speaking in front of advocacy groups and gatherings at Notre Dame and St. Mary’s, including graduate speech-pathology classes. The goal is to help them understand the difficulties that those on the autism spectrum have communicating. Until recently, Mr. Tidmarsh lived with his parents. Now he has moved into a house with a friend who is also on the spectrum. His parents pay for his housing, but he hopes that will change. “My goal is to be self-sufficient,” he says, as well as help to employ others on the spectrum. Toward that end, he is mentoring workers at Green Bridge. Matt Coleman, Mr. Tidmarsh’s longtime friend and now his roommate, works alongside him, planting and harvesting, and monitoring water levels. Adam Rousculp, who is also on the spectrum, feeds the fish and cleans the tank. Photos and explanations hang throughout the pilot greenhouse to explain the process to visitors and help workers, who better absorb information visually. The changes in Mr. Tidmarsh are striking to Ms. Pilarski. “I’ve seen him grow in such a lovely way,” she says. On a recent afternoon, Mr. Tidmarsh checks nutrient levels in tanks that hold koi at the pilot greenhouse. Afterward, he creates holes 1/8th-inch deep and drops seeds into trays of soil. Later, at the site of Green Bridge’s two new greenhouses, he describes his plan to plant perennial rye in an open field on the property to restore microbes in the soil and prevent erosion. He’s optimistic about the future of Green Bridge. “It does provide hope not just for me, but others on the autism spectrum to find and keep jobs,” he says. “I think I can see myself doing this for the rest of my life.” Ms. Ansberry writes The Wall Street Journal’s Turning Points column.

29,"U.S. Christmas tree shortage a gift for Canadian growers, a scramble for buyers","Exporting boon expected in Central and Eastern Canada, but shoppers, especially in B.C., to face higher prices and limited selection",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/us-christmas-tree-shortage-a-gift-for-canadian-growers-a-scramble-for-buyers/article37134730/,2017-11-30T00:59:50Z,"The scramble to get a beautiful Christmas tree has started. And it's likely going to be roughest in British Columbia. While a shortage of Christmas trees in the United States is turning into an exporting boon for growers in Eastern and Central Canada, B.C. shoppers are expected to face stiffer prices and a more dismal selection of evergreens. ""People may not be able to buy the choice of trees they want,"" said Art Loewen, whose business, Pine Meadows Tree Farms in Chilliwack, supplies local garden centres. ""There will be enough trees, but they might not get the choice they want."" Story continues below advertisement But for Canadian growers, who suffered through a dark period seven years ago, when they faced a glut of trees from U.S. producers, things have rebounded. This fall's orders were exceptional, said Jimmy Downey, whose family farm, Sapinière Downey, is located in Hatley, in Quebec's Eastern Townships, an area southeast of Montreal that exports 85 per cent of its fir trees to the United States. This is the first year that most of Mr. Downey's sales were finalized many months before workers started cutting the trees. ""We try to run after our clients. This year, it was the opposite. The clients were running after us to get their trees,"" said Mr. Downey, who is president of growers' group the Association des producteurs d'arbres de Noël du Québec. ""It seems to be a really good year. We are selling to the max,"" said Shirley Brennan, executive director of the Canadian Christmas Tree Growers Association. The scarcity in the United States is, however, a concern in B.C., which relies on U.S. imports. Other parts of Canada are not expected to be affected and big chains such as Loblaw and IKEA said they will be properly supplied for the holiday season. The problem south of the border has been attributed to a delayed result of the recession that began in 2007. There were fewer sales, less harvesting and, as a result, U.S. growers planted fewer new trees, which need a decade to mature into adequate size. Mr. Downey said he had been getting more orders from Washington State, where dry conditions might have affected the tree crops. ""You end up with [what] we call a Charlie Brown tree … you only see a few needles and a trunk and branches. It's not appearing green, it won't give a nice smell in the house, it's not marketable."" Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement B.C. relies on imports from the United States as its limited agricultural land has pushed farmers toward higher-value crops, said Mr. Loewen, an executive with the B.C. Christmas Tree Council. ""We've never grown enough of our own and we've always imported a lot from the U.S. That has become tougher,"" he said. His business is growing fewer firs because he can't rent additional acreages any more. He has had to buy more trees from U.S. suppliers to keep up with the demand, but their prices have gone up. For example, noble firs that he used to buy for $30 or less a unit now cost $50 wholesale. In addition to higher prices, he said that instead of Fraser or balsam firs, retailers might have to sell grand firs, which don't keep their needles as well, Mr. Loewen said. In Nova Scotia, booming demand for real trees in the United States has many growers uncertain of whether they can cut enough trees this December to keep up with wholesale demand. Story continues below advertisement The province's Christmas tree industry is large and in the midst of a rebound after going through ""a rough period,"" said Angus Bonnyman, executive director of the Nova Scotia Christmas Tree Council. Increasingly, big-box retailers in both Canada and the United States have been turning to Nova Scotia growers to pick up the slack from large U.S. growers, he said. Whether that will translate into shortages and higher prices at retail tree lots is not yet clear. ""There should be a tree for everyone. We wouldn't want folks to panic,"" Mr. Bonnyman said, while suggesting in the same breath that shoppers buy their trees early. Mr. Bonnyman said there aren't reliable statistics on the number of trees sent to the United States versus other provinces, where trees are commonly given new tags of origin and sold again. Growers in Nova Scotia are independent and often family-owned; they are not compelled to disclose sales data. Even growers who supply the Canadian domestic market feel the pressure from a tree-starved U.S. market. Cindy Rhodenizer, who runs G.A.R. Tree Farms with her husband in Nova Scotia's Lunenburg County, supplies one main client, a big-box retailer with stores across Canada.

30,Canadian pot ETF targeting junior firms wins approval,It’ll be the third cannabis exchange-traded fund for Canada,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/funds-and-etfs/etfs/canadian-pot-etf-targeting-junior-firms-wins-approval/article37879194/,2018-02-06T21:34:32Z,"This Valentine's day could see Canadians looking to grab more green buds than rose buds, as Horizons ETFs Management (Canada) Inc. is set to launch its second marijuana-focused fund, this time tapping into small-cap companies in the industry. With the ticker HMJR, the Horizons Junior Marijuana Growers Index ETF seeks to replicate the performance of the Solactive junior marijuana growers index. The underlying index is designed to provide exposure to the performance of a basket of primarily North American publicly listed small-capitalization companies primarily involved in the cultivation, production and/or distribution of marijuana. Stocks within the Index generally must have a market capitalization greater than $50-million but less than $500-million for initial inclusion. Story continues below advertisement ""HMJR will give investors direct exposure to a growing group of Canadian and global marijuana cultivation and distribution companies,"" said Steve Hawkins, President and Co-CEO of Horizons ETFs in a statement. ""Marijuana producers are generally well-positioned to take part in the anticipated global expansion of the marijuana sector."" Similar to the gold sector in the United States, where there is the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF ( GDX ) and the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF ( GDXJ ), HMJR will focus more on small-cap, early-stage marijuana companies. Horizons launched the world's first marijuana-focused ETF – the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF – last April. The fund, which goes by the ticker HMMJ – saw more than $100-million in assets under management within the first month. Similar to HMMJ, the new fund has a hefty price tag with a management fee of 0.85 per cent. But unlike the company's first marijuana fund, HMJR will exclusively focus on marijuana producers and growers and will not include the bio-pharmaceutical and ancillary business of the sector. HMJR will launch Feb. 14 on the NEO exchange – another difference to HMMJ which launched on the Toronto Stock Exchange. One reason for the switch is to allow for the inclusion of more Canadian-listed operations that do a significant amount of business in the United States. This could include companies such as Marapharm Ventures Inc., a licensed producer of medical marijuana.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,Innovative materials from bamboo are helping a new industry to sprout,"A bamboo spider rides high FANNING out from the sodden delta of the Yangtze, and southward to the flanks of the Nanling mountains, over 6m hectares of emerald bamboo groves—one-fifth of the world’s reserves—flourish in China. Giant pandas nibble the softest s…",https://www.economist.com/news/business/21735044-bamboo-versatile-environmentally-friendly-and-support-chinas,2018-01-18T15:48:15Z,"FANNING out from the sodden delta of the Yangtze, and southward to the flanks of the Nanling mountains, over 6m hectares of emerald bamboo groves—one-fifth of the world’s reserves—flourish in China. Giant pandas nibble the softest shoots. Around 40bn pairs of disposable chopsticks are made from bamboo twigs annually in China, for use with everyday meals. Steel scaffolding is still often shunned for bamboo on skyscrapers under construction in even the ritziest parts of Hong Kong. The history of the grass is colourful, too. Before paper, Chinese wrote on bamboo slips; they used bamboo tubes for irrigation, and later stuffed them with gunpowder to ignite muskets. Yet for all its importance and abundance bamboo is “China’s forgotten plant”, says Martin Tam, an expert in Hong Kong. To demonstrate its potential, he greets visitors with a can of bamboo juice, proffers a bamboo business card, and gestures to a bamboo armchair near his desk. He says the plant should be “green gold”, for it is one of the world’s swiftest growers, gaining up to 1m a day, and can be harvested in under ten years, half the time it takes for the softest woods to mature. Its tensile strength is greater than that of mild steel. It withstands compression twice as well as concrete, and needs next to no watering, pesticides or fertilisers. Upgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors' Picks newsletters. But the hard work begins after it is cut. Though it thrives in steamy, rain-drenched areas, bamboo products require a lot of treatment to withstand sunshine and moisture, as they still contain sugar and water. A string of lacquers, resins, waxes, bleaches and preservatives are required to stave off termites and decay. As a result, manufacturing has remained labour-intensive, crude and small-scale, says Mr Tam. Factories nestle in bamboo groves. Margins are low. Toothpicks, matchsticks, incense sticks, mats and baskets are still among the plant’s most common offshoots. Selling “poor man’s timber” to Chinese is hard. In Shengzhou, among the most prolific regions in Zhejiang province in eastern China, about 95% of bamboo handicrafts are exported. But the material’s prospects are improving. One reason is environmental awareness. Chinese firms account for 90% of the international export market for laminated bamboo flooring, the appeal of which has grown as Western consumers go green. In 2016 factories churned out 116m square metres of it. The International Bamboo and Rattan Organisation, an intergovernmental body based in Beijing, says the renewable, low-carbon alternative to plastics and timber is now “part of China’s environmental leadership bid”. Bamboo releases lots of oxygen into the air, swallowing four times as much carbon as some trees. Since 2012, Chinese companies can offset their carbon emissions by buying credits in bamboo plantations. At a forum last May on President Xi Jinping’s “Belt and Road” initiative for better infrastructure, a private company from Zhejiang province was invited to display bamboo strong enough to build storm-drainage pipes and shock-resistant exteriors for bullet-train carriages. The Chinese state is giving generous subsidies to farmers. The annual value of the bamboo industry has grown 500-fold since 1981, to $32bn; in three years China plans to boost this to $48bn, and to have 10m employed. Heats shoots and leaves Technology is also changing things. Bamboo is finding its way into a range of new plywoods and plastics. Bamboo powder, produced during manufacturing, has mainly been used to fuel factories. Now it is being combined with resins to make new materials. Leftover plastics recycled from air-conditioning and suitcase factories are mixed with bamboo powder to make outdoor decking for the likes of Verdee, a fashionable bamboo-flooring and homeware store in Hong Kong. Taohuajiang, one of a handful of big companies in the industry, wants to get more high-tech. Based in Hunan province, Taohuajiang was listed in June 2016 on the NEEQ, a Chinese startup exchange. Its net profit, of 4.6m yuan ($700,000) in 2016, came mainly from selling bamboo flooring and beams. Recently it patented a carbonisation process, done through successive heatings, that ensures bamboo cannot corrode. Peng Jian of Taohuajiang is confident that the “magic grass” could end up replacing steel, timber and plastic (though as yet his new eco-friendly material is two-and-a-half times the price of steel, too heavy to substitute for wood in furniture and cannot be bent like plastic). Mr Peng’s bamboo composites have, however, been used in everything from railway sleepers to manhole covers. BMW and Lexus, both carmakers, are among his traders’ clients, as they consider replacing plastic and wood in car interiors. A German marine-floorings firm wants to apply his bamboo composites to cruise decks. A Canadian company in the space industry is using them in its telescopes. Other bits of the bamboo industry face harder times. As scaffolding, it has been phased out in much of mainland China as a potential safety and fire hazard. Hong Kong still lashes together about 5m bamboo poles a year at its construction sites. They are three times quicker to erect than steel rods and cost a fraction of the price. But the number of workmen trained on bamboo is dwindling. At WLS Holdings, among the oldest bamboo-scaffolding firms on the island, losses have grown. The firm’s problems go deeper than bamboo, but its fading fortunes capture something. As one part of the industry wilts, another looks about to shoot up.

Giant pandas nibble the softest shoots. Around 40bn pairs of disposable chopsticks are made from bamboo twigs annually in China, for use with everyday meals. Steel scaffolding is still often shunned for bamboo on skyscrapers under construction in even the ritziest parts of Hong Kong. The history of the grass is colourful, too. Before paper, Chinese wrote on bamboo slips; they used bamboo tubes for irrigation, and later stuffed them with gunpowder to ignite muskets. Yet for all its importance and abundance bamboo is “China’s forgotten plant”, says Martin Tam, an expert in Hong Kong. To demonstrate its potential, he greets visitors with a can of bamboo juice, proffers a bamboo business card, and gestures to a bamboo armchair near his desk. He says the plant should be “green gold”, for it is one of the world’s swiftest growers, gaining up to 1m a day, and can be harvested in under ten years, half the time it takes for the softest woods to mature. Its tensile strength is greater than that of mild steel. It withstands compression twice as well as concrete, and needs next to no watering, pesticides or fertilisers.

Though it thrives in steamy, rain-drenched areas, bamboo products require a lot of treatment to withstand sunshine and moisture, as they still contain sugar and water. A string of lacquers, resins, waxes, bleaches and preservatives are required to stave off termites and decay. As a result, manufacturing has remained labour-intensive, crude and small-scale, says Mr Tam. Factories nestle in bamboo groves. Margins are low. Toothpicks, matchsticks, incense sticks, mats and baskets are still among the plant’s most common offshoots. Selling “poor man’s timber” to Chinese is hard.

33,"Want to Save the Planet? Go Vegan, Study Says","Even slight changes in a person's diet can make a huge different to our planet, researchers found.",http://www.newsweek.com/want-save-planet-go-vegan-study-says-952789,2018-06-01T11:30:09Z,"Adopting a vegan diet (free from animal products such as dairy, eggs and meat) is the best way to protect the planet, according to a major new study. By carrying out the most comprehensive investigation yet into the environmental impact of food production, researchers found that even buying sustainably sourced meat or dairy didn't outdo the benefits of a plant-based diet. And unless there is a major change in how animal products are cultivated and manufactured, eating vegan food will be better for the planet in the foreseeable future than farmers tinkering with their methods. In the U.S., where meat consumption is per capita three times the global average, the adoption of plant-based diets could cut food emissions by between 61% to 73%. And the worldwide adoption of vegan eating would reduce global agricultural land by around 3.1 billion hectares, or almost three quarters. ""At present, it’s better to change what you consume, rather than trying to purchase sustainable animal products. So plant-based diets are the best way to reduce foods impacts,"" Joseph Poore of the Department of Zoology and the School of Geography and Environment, Oxford University, and co author of the study published in Science, told Newsweek. He also highlighted that food is not just an issue for green-house gas emissions but causes almost all of the world's major environmental issues. ""As an individual, you can have that impact today—not 20, 50 or 100 years into the future when it might be too late,"" he said. Scientists have produced the most detailed analysis yet on how farming damages the planet. Getty Images Even a slight change in what we eat can have a big impact on the environment, the study showed. In lieu of a vegan diet, cutting down on animal products by half worldwide and not buying from high-impact producers would achieve 73% of the reduction in emissions of an entirely plant-based diet, according to the researchers. And lessening the consumption of oils, refined sugar, stimulants, and alcohol by a fifth would slash greenhouse gas emissions created by these products by 43%. See all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows If consumers ditched the most impactful meat and dairy products in favor of plant-based foods, the environment would reap rewards equivalent to two-thirds seen in stopping meat and dairy production altogether. Clearer labeling and tax breaks on certain products could help consumers make more informed choices, the authors suggest. The study also uncovered huge differences in the environmental impact of the same types of food. High-impact beef, for instance, produced 12 times more CO2 equivalents and used 50 times more land per 100 grams of protein than low-impact beef. But compared to pea growers, low-impact beef farmers used 36 times more land and emitted six times more emissions. Meanwhile, high-impact rice created 500% more green house gas emissios than low-impact variants, and a cup of coffee can create as little as 80g of CO2 or as much as 1.3kg, depending on production methods. Aquaculture practices, which involve animals in ponds or nets typically fed with crops or by-products which are widely believed to be more environmentally friendly than land-based farming, created more methane and greenhouse gases than cows per kilogram of liveweight. A small number of the producers were responsible for the majority of the environmental impact. For instance, 15% of beef production uses around 950 million hectares of land globally, and creates around 1.3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalents. Beef can create 25,000% higher greenhouse gas emissions and use 11,000% more land than legumes, the study showed. Producers can reduce their impact by adopting new technologies, but this can only go so far, the researchers said. For instance, a low-impact liter of cow’s milk creates double the emissions and uses almost two times as much land as the same amount of soy milk. To understand the environmental impact of the specific food products and the global farming industry, Poore and Thomas Nemecek of the Swiss agricultural research institute, Agroscope, analyzed 570 studies tracking the field-to-fork journeys of 40 different foods. The study involved data on over 38,000 farms and 1,600 processors, packaging types and retailers across 123 countries. The researchers looked into the land and water use, greenhouse gas emissions, as well as ocean acidification and eutrophication caused by the 40 different products. They noted that there are currently more than 570 million farms producing crops across the world. ""Two things that look the same in the shops can have very different impacts on the planet,” Joseph Poore said in a statement. ""Food production creates immense environmental burdens, but these are not a necessary consequence of our needs. They can be significantly reduced by changing how we produce and what we consume."" Dr Peter Alexander, lecturer in Global Food Security at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the study, told Newsweek that the findings are ""extremely comprehensive"" and ""highly impressive."" The study doesn't take into account the environmental benfits of managed grazing, and the positive cultural and social outcomes of livestock production and consumption, he argued. ""We should not interpret these results as the need to become vegan, but rather to moderate our consumption and seek a more equitable distribution of food that creates healthier diets for all,"" he said.

Life was tough for her family in Mindanao, the second largest island in the Philippines, as they struggled to earn $1,000 a year from their produce, with their coffee beans fetching only 20 cents per kilo from local traders. But Dubria is now one of hundreds of farmers nationwide who are brewing up a storm with training from Coffee For Peace (CfP) - a social enterprise striving to boost growers’ profits, protect the environment and foster peace between communities. Having learned how to grow, harvest and process high-quality Arabica beans at a time when global demand for coffee is soaring - it is set to hit a record high this year - Dubria exports her crop to buyers as far away as Seattle for at least $5 per kilo. “But it’s not all about the money - it’s about taking responsibility for the environment and other communities,” Dubria told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in her home on Mount Apo while brewing a pot of thick, aromatic, treacle-like coffee. Beyond helping coffee growers get a better deal, CfP aims to encourage dialogue between communities, with tensions ranging from colonial-era conflict between native Muslims and Christian settlers to land and resource disputes between ethnic groups. The Philippines is battling to restore order to troubled Mindanao, where militant groups have pledged allegiance to Islamic State, and five decades of communist insurgency and separatist bombings have displaced at least 2 million people. By bringing people together through trade, businesses with a social mission can help build peace, industry experts say. “Social enterprise presents an emerging pathway or approach to conflict resolution,” said Angel Flores, East Asia business head at the British Council, which backs companies seeking to help people, invest in the environment and tackle social ills. “Being inclusive, participatory and prioritizing community benefit over personal agendas enhances the social fabric from a place of distrust to... confidence and mutual understanding.” “FARMERPRENEURS” CfP was set up in 2008 on the conflict-hit southern island of Mindanao, after its founders stopped Christian and Muslim neighbors going to war over the ownership of a rice field. The men were invited to put down their guns and talk over coffee, a tradition which quickly spread across the region. CfP offers a three-year scheme to train farmers to produce coffee while encouraging native and settler communities and various tribes to harvest and process the beans together. While the social enterprise buys the farmers’ beans above market value - selling them on to local coffee shops and exporting as far as Canada - communities can sell to any buyer, but are encouraged to demand higher prices. “We don’t treat them as suppliers or just part of the chain - they are farmerpreneurs,” said CfP senior vice president Twinkle Bautista. “The aim is to unite the settlers and indigenous people to teach each other, share techniques and tools... and harmony,” she added. “Our product is peace - coffee is just the tool.” For Kagawad Abe and his indigenous community, setting up a processing centre through CfP has brought them closer to the Christian settlers - who work with them to process their beans. “It has also brought women together, and given them a chance to work independently... to contribute to the tribe,” he said. About 80 percent of CfP’s coffee-growing partners are women. “Just five or so years ago, we didn’t really know each other - but now we are talking and working together,” Abe added. CfP says business is booming, having tripled sales to at least $46,000 last year from $15,000 in 2012 and won United Nations and regional awards for promoting peace and development. Although social enterprises in the Philippines have more than tripled in the last decade to 165,000, many are struggling due to limited state support and a lack of funding, said the British Council and the Philippines Social Enterprise Network. CfP’s success is likely largely due to its unusual mission, said Gerry Higgins, chief executive of Community Enterprise in Scotland (CEIS), Britain’s largest agency to support the sector. “Coffee for Peace is unusual... there aren’t many social enterprises that recognize that if a community is resilient and sustainable, (then) fewer conflicts will emerge,” Higgins said. CONQUERORS OF COFFEE By walking farmers through every step of the supply chain, CfP says they no longer see the coffee industry as “a mystery”. Once dependent on traders and big brands such as Nestle, the world’s biggest coffee maker and producer of Nescafe, farmers can now demand higher prices for better quality beans, CfP said. Yet winning communities over remains a major challenge. Some are proud of their traditional methods and reluctant to embrace change, while others are wary of civil society groups and used to instant cash or aid, rather than long-term support. “We had to convince and convince our people, many times, to move from the traditional to the technical way of doing things,” said Baby Jerlina Owok, chieftain of a native tribe which has seen their coffee beans almost double in value in recent years. Yet for women such as Owok and Dubria and their coffee cooperatives, the ambitions are much bigger than making money. Pointing at huge swathes of coffee trees covering the hills, painting once barren land vibrant shades of green, Dubria spoke about planting more to combat deforestation and soil erosion. Lastly, she said they need to share their prosperity. “We need to encourage and help other communities to produce quality coffee,” she said. “We want to pull them up - to improve their standard of living - so they can experience what we have.” Reporting By Kieran Guilbert, Additional Reporting by Lee Mannion in London, Editing by Katy Migiro.

36,Peas fall from favour as Canadian farmers swap acres for wheat,"Pea and lentil demand surged amid rising demand for vegetarian staples, but production swell quickly led to global glut",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/peas-fall-from-favour-as-canadian-farmers-swap-acres-for-wheat/article37978819/,2018-02-14T19:45:41Z,"Just a few years ago, it seemed as if Canada's farmers couldn't get peas into the ground fast enough, but they're now falling out of favour. Pea plantings will probably decline to a seven-year low this spring, while lentil acreage drops by 27 per cent, according to the agriculture ministry. Sowings will decline as farmers swap land for wheat and canola, the Canadian-made oilseed that's used in everything from salad dressing to french fries. It's a classic crop boom and bust. Since 2014, pea and lentil acres surged across the country amid rising demand for the vegetarian staples and as farmers enjoyed record prices for the legumes. But that swell of production quickly led to a global glut and sent prices tumbling. Now, countries such as India, the world's biggest consumer, are imposing tariffs on imports to try to shore up markets for domestic suppliers. Regina-based AGT Food &amp; Ingredients Inc., one of the top exporters of pulse crops, has slumped more than 40 per cent in the past 12 months. Story continues below advertisement ""It is challenging to put pulses in knowing that returns are not going to be as profitable,"" said grower Morgan Nunweiler, who plans to slash his lentil acres in half and plant more wheat on his 3,000-acre farm near Rosetown, Sask. ""Looks like defaulting to cereals and canola is kind of what farmers in the area are doing."" Grower bids, a measure of cash prices, for some grades of large green lentils have tumbled 34 per cent since November, and bids for red lentils were as low as 16.5 Canadian cents a pound in mid-February, according to data from Vancouver-based Stat Communications. By comparison, canola futures remained steady since Nov. 30, while benchmark wheat traded in Chicago climbed more than 8 per cent. As supplies grew, prices were further hurt amid declining export prospects. In December, India imposed a 30-per-cent duty on chickpea and lentil imports. The chickpea tax was increased to 40 per cent this month. The country had bumper harvests and is trying to unload its surplus inventory. ""After India did what they did, it sort of shocks the market and shocks farmers a bit,"" said Corey Loessin, board chairman of the Saskatchewan Pulse Growers. Meanwhile, export demand for canola from countries such as China, Mexico and Japan remains strong, and additional oilseed acres will not result in a supply glut, according to Chuck Penner, the owner of LeftField Commodity Research in Winnipeg. Rising acres will send production of the oilseed to an all-time high, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada said in a Jan. 25 report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,Farmers who propelled Trump to presidency fear becoming pawns in trade war - Washington Post,"Washington Post Farmers who propelled Trump to presidency fear becoming pawns in trade war Washington Post MANKATO, Minn. — Many of the farmers who helped propel Donald Trump to the presidency fear becoming pawns in his escalating trade war with China, which …",https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/farmers-who-propelled-trump-to-presidency-fear-becoming-pawns-in-trade-war/2018/04/08/2d110a50-398f-11e8-9c0a-85d477d9a226_story.html,2018-04-08T20:13:44Z,"MANKATO, Minn. — Many of the farmers who helped propel Donald Trump to the presidency fear becoming pawns in his escalating trade war with China, which threatens markets for soybeans, corn and other lifeblood crops in the Upper Midwest. But Jim Hagedorn, a former GOP congressional aide and Treasury official running for an open House seat, says they should keep their faith in Trump. “He understands just how important it is to these rural areas that we have these markets,” Hagedorn said in an interview at his campaign office. “Do I understand that the president has the prerogative to go out and negotiate? Of course I do. But I trust that in the end, he’s going to do everything possible to make sure that we help everyone in the United States, including our farmers.” Trump’s aggressive, lurching attacks on China over trade are putting Republicans like Hagedorn in a difficult spot — torn between siding with Trump while acknowledging the economic peril to many of their constituents. The issue presents yet another challenge to the GOP in a tough midterm election year even in the rural areas across the upper Midwest that swept Trump to victory — and where control of the Senate could be decided. When China threatened a 25 percent tariff on soybeans, Mike Petefish, who grows the crop over 2,000 acres, feared the worst. Soybeans are a $2 billion business in Minnesota. “A 40-cent drop in soybeans, like we saw on Wednesday, meant $50,000 of value evaporating out of my bottom line,” said Petefish, the 33-year-old president of the Minnesota Soybean Growers Association. “The last time I talked to our banker, he told me that of all his clients — these are all farmers — only four made money last year. We kind of broke even. But this year was looking tough even before the tariffs.” [ They voted for Donald Trump. Now soybean farmers could get slammed by the trade war he started.] In Minnesota’s 1st congressional District, six-term Democratic Rep. Tim Walz is retiring to run for governor, opening up a seat Trump won by 15 points. Hagedorn, 65, is considered the best GOP candidate to turn a blue seat red. A third of the state’s soybean crop comes from the district. It also is home to Martin County, the top hog-producing county in the state and one that has been dubbed the “Bacon Capital of the World.” China’s tariffs on pork will hit hard too. Trump’s March 1 announcement of new tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum had been popular, especially after the quiet carve-outs for Mexico and Canada. Democrats in Minnesota’s 8th district, where thousands of iron miners live and work, had embraced the tariffs; they’d done the same in Illinois’ 12th district, where U.S. Steel reacted to Trump by reopening a plant. The second wave of the trade war has complicated the political outlook for Republican candidates in rural races. Last year, after Wisconsin’s 3rd district swung from a 11-point Obama seat to a 5-point Trump seat, the National Republican Congressional Committee added Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.) to their targets for 2018. But the party’s candidate, Steve Toft, raised just $66,015 in 2017, compared with $1,163,935 for Kind. The seat, which borders Minnesota’s 1st district, had been moving away from Republicans even before the tariffs — which Toft did not support. “That’s not really free markets. I think the president intends to strengthen the steel industry — and we probably need to do that — but it’s probably not going to help the people in this district,” Toft said. Officially, Trump’s party is giving candidates a pass on the trade war. “Candidates and members will support policies based on what’s best for their districts,” said National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Jesse Hunt. For much of 2017, Republicans sought to portray Democrats as unhinged by the president, obsessed with scandal. The trade war has allowed rural Democrats to pivot, advocating stability against a backdrop of threats and confusion. In the midst of the latest tariff announcements, Kind held three town hall meetings, where farmers from the dairy, corn, and soybean industries pleaded for relief. “It’s going to hurt American farmers, no doubt about it,” said Jarous Valenec, a 43-year old dairy farmer who attended one town hall. “We were already looking at depressed prices for corn and soybeans, before this. There’s no sector that’s showing good numbers.” Joseph Zenz, 52, a cash crop farmer in southwest Wisconsin, said the panic over prices might have been “a knee-jerk reaction” to something that negotiations could settle. “China still needs our product. China still needs soybeans,” said Zenz. “But every year seems to get more challenging. More competition. Prices keep getting higher. Farmland keeps getting more expensive.” But like many farmers, Valence and Zenz had supported Trump for president. Clinton, explained Zenz, had “nothing to offer” to people who had struggled in the final years of Obama’s presidency. Weeks into the trade war, Trump’s alternative seemed to be chaos. “Yeah, China has been cheating,” said Kind in an interview. “Now’s the time to build an international coalition to stand up to them, not to go it alone. That’s just going to invite the kind of retaliation that we saw this week.” Republicans in agricultural states were sounding the same notes as Kind, and openly questioning the administration’s handling of the fallout. Several asked what Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue had meant last month when he suggested “mitigation” on behalf of farmers if a trade war broke out. On Wednesday, Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), whom the president had personally recruited to run for Senate this year, urged Perdue to use every tool “to protect ag producers from effects resulting in potential trade actions against China.” [ Republican Kevin Cramer to run for Senate in North Dakota in boost for GOP ] In Wisconsin, where two Republicans are fighting for the nomination against Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), candidate Kevin Nicholson delighted Democrats by telling a local news channel that farmers might have to put up with “risk.” “We’ve made so many mistakes to get to this point that it’s going to involve some amount of risk to undo it,” said Nicholson. “The president’s objective is clearly a world without tariffs.” Unlike Republicans, who risk alienating their base when criticizing the president, Democrats have plunged into the fray. In the 1st district, where five Democrats are competing to replace Walz, each candidate quickly condemned the administration for launching a trade war on TV instead of using the low-key — but less disruptive — tools available in the World Trade Organization. “There’s such uncertainty in ag in the first place,” said Dan Feehan, an Army veteran who served in the Obama administration and led the field in fundraising. “Negotiating tactics, in my view, are done in the form of a negotiation. When you’re making policy, you start with everyone at the table talking through their concerns. Otherwise, you don’t know what the other side is thinking, and it turns into a very dark situation.” Joe Sullivan, a green energy advocate running to Feehan’s left, called the trade war “a completely self-inflicted wound.” Republicans, who had convinced farmers to abandon the Democrats, said that they could win the argument before November. Hagedorn argued that any Democratic victory could restore the policies of the Obama era, including regulations on water use and pollution that many farmers had despised.

38,"As election looms, Modi's popularity wanes in rural India","KAIRANA, India (Reuters) - Indian farmers voted overwhelmingly for Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2014 general election that swept him to power. He cannot count on them doing so again, as a crash in commodity prices and surging fuel costs stoke anger in …",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-farmers-politics-insight/as-election-looms-modis-popularity-wanes-in-rural-india-idUSKCN1IZ03F,2018-06-03T04:37:57Z,"KAIRANA, India (Reuters) - Indian farmers voted overwhelmingly for Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2014 general election that swept him to power. He cannot count on them doing so again, as a crash in commodity prices and surging fuel costs stoke anger in the countryside. Four years ago, Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, winning 73 of 80 seats, as the rural poor - swayed by promises of higher crop prices - deserted the rival Congress party. Now, facing criticism for not improving living standards in the countryside, where 70 percent of India’s 1.3 billion people live, analysts and farm economists said Modi would find it hard to repeat the feat in a general election due by May 2019. While it is risky to predict election outcomes in India, where religion and caste remain important issues – not to mention the influence of fickle regional parties - interviews with some of the state’s millions of farmers suggest rural angst could cost the government dearly. “No doubt, there was a wave for Modi in 2014, but farmers are disenchanted with him now,” said sugar cane grower Uday Vir Singh, 53, plonking down on a wicker chair and smoking his hookah. “Modi promised to double farmers’ income but our earning has halved because of his apathy and anti-farmer policies.” Nearly half a dozen farmers sitting with Singh on a hand-woven rope cot, and many of others in Kairana - which elected a joint opposition candidate from a small regional party in a key by-election this week - accused Modi and the Uttar Pradesh administration, also run by the BJP, of failing to live up to their promises and overlooking the concerns of villagers. “Modi is a very good salesman but we are not going to fall prey to his glib talk again,” said 55-year-old Narendra Kalhande, who grows cane on his 2.5 acre farm. Farm Minister Radha Mohan Singh defended the government’s record, citing initiatives on irrigation, crop insurance and electronic trading platforms for farmers to sell produce. “For farmers, Prime Minister Modi’s 48 months have been much better than the Congress’s rule of 48 years,” Singh told Reuters, referring to the main opposition party that dominated Indian politics for most of the years since independence from British colonial rule in 1947. CRISIS IN COUNTRYSIDE Higher inflation and sluggish growth helped Modi trounce Congress, which had long counted the rural poor as its core constituency, in the 2014 election. Small farmers had been hit by rising living costs but benefited little from rising food prices because of the web of middlemen in India’s agricultural markets. Since then the economy has picked up, recording its quickest pace of expansion in nearly two years in the first three months of 2018, helped by higher growth in the farm sector. But lower food prices, weaker farm wages and modest crop procurement rates - the result of a shift in focus from the subsidies favored by Congress to investment under the pro-business BJP - have hurt most of India’s 263 million farmers, who typically own less than 2 hectares of land. In the past year, Modi’s popularity has fallen by 12 percentage points among farmers, according to a “Mood of the Nation” survey published last week by the Lokniti, part of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), a research institute. Next year’s election would be fought on farmers’ issues, said Yogendra Yadav, a leading academic-turned-politician. Farmer organizations in some states began a 10-strike on Friday, in which they have said they will stop selling produce to protest a steep drop in the prices of an array of farm goods. Farm Minister Singh said his government had yet to hear from farm leaders but was ready to listen. COMMODITIES CRASH Prices of pulses, a key crop for Indian farmers, have fallen 25-30 percent below state-set support prices, as higher imports and bumper local crops bumped up supplies. While the government announces support prices for more than 20 crops each year to set a benchmark, state agencies actually buy only rice and wheat at the support level. Vegetable prices, especially onions, cabbage and tomatoes have fallen 25 percent from last year, largely because of the lack of refrigerated trucks that could take the perishables to the consuming big cities. Milk prices have also dived by more than 25 percent in the past year as a global glut has brought exports to a near halt. Farmers in Charkhi Dadri, three hours’ drive west of the capital New Delhi, recently dumped tomatoes onto the road in protest after buyers offered a quarter of a rupee per kilogram for a crop that costs at least 6 rupees ($0.09) a kg to produce. Jai Bhagwan, 54, borrowed 12,000 rupees to grow onions on a plot of about half acre in Jhajjar, an area otherwise famed for pottery. When his crop was ready, Jai Bhagwan could get only 1,200 rupees. “I could not even recover my labor cost,” said Jai Bhagwan, who was in New Delhi recently to participate in a farmers’ meet. Prakash Singh, also from Jhajjar, spent 6,000 rupees to grow green chilli, but the crop fetched him barely 200 rupees. “I’m in debt up to my eyeballs. But I can’t sit idle, so I’ll have to borrow more to grow something else,” Singh said. Ashok Gulati, a farm economist who advised India’s last government, said there were three policy options to support farmers: building state buffer stocks to soak up excess supply, acting to boost exports or building capacity for processing farm commodities into end products such as milled, dehusked pulses or vegetable oils. Most of those measures would require long-term structural changes, however, and analysts predict in the run-up to the election Modi is likely to announce more populist, short-term fixes such as higher guaranteed prices for crops and farm loan waivers. Many farmers complained they are still reeling from disruptions caused by the launch of a new nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July 2017 and a ban on high denomination bank notes in November 2016. Blaming the shock move for exacerbating farmers’ financial woes, Gulati said: “Expectations were high from the government, but the fact is that the plight of farmers is far worse now than what it was four years ago.” Modi’s drive to purge “black money” from the economy by removing, at a stroke, 86 percent of the cash in circulation, made it difficult for farmers, who survive on cash, to buy inputs like seeds and receive payments for their crops. In Kairana, all 35 farmers Reuters spoke to agreed that abolishing 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes had made things worse. POWER SURGE Farmers in Uttar Pradesh, home to 220 million people, are also angry over a sharp rise in the pump price of diesel and a steep hike in electricity tariffs. Many farmers in the state use diesel to run tractors for plowing and trolleys for moving their produce to wholesale markets. They depend on electricity to operate irrigation pumps. Diesel prices have shot up by more than 40 percent to record highs and electricity tariffs have surged by more 20 percent in the past two years, said Shri Pal, a farmer from Shamli. “Villages account for most of India’s diesel consumption and that’s why higher prices pinch farmers the most, but diesel in India is much more expensive than Bhutan, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka,” said Hannan Mollah, a former lawmaker and a senior official of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Kairana and Shamli lie in the sugar cane belt of Uttar Pradesh, the top sugar state of India, the world’s biggest producer after Brazil. Soaring global output has caused a collapse in sugar prices, leading to losses for mills who now owe nearly 23 billion rupees to cane growers. A BJP spokesman, G.V.L. Narasimha Rao, said the government has streamlined timely payments to cane growers. That has not been enough to satisfy farmers such as Ram Lakhan Singh, a cane grower from Shamli. “Most sugar mills have not paid us a single rupee since December and the government has connived with them to deprive us of our rightful dues. Trust me, cane farmers will think twice before voting for the BJP.” Reporting by Mayank Bhardwaj; Editing by Alex Richardson",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,Big labour sees growth potential in California’s marijuana fields,Discord between unions could upend what promises to be an opportunity for U.S. labour to regain lost influence,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/us-business/big-labour-sees-growth-potential-in-californias-marijuana-fields/article37429504/,2017-12-26T21:29:54Z,"Unions have caught a whiff of a rare opportunity to organize a whole new set of workers as recreational marijuana becomes legal in California. The United Farm Workers, Teamsters and United Food and Commercial Workers are looking to unionize the tens of thousands of potential workers involved in the legal weed game, from planters to rollers to sellers. The move could provide a boost to organized labour's lagging membership – if infighting doesn't get in the way. The United Farm Workers, co-founded by iconic labour leader Cesar Chavez, says organizing an industry rooted in agriculture is a natural fit and growers could label their products with the union's logo as a marketing strategy. Story continues below advertisement ""If you're a cannabis worker, the UFW wants to talk with you,"" national vice-president Armando Elenes said. But United Food and Commercial Workers, which represents grocery-store employees, meat packers and retail workers, registered its intent to organize cannabis workers across the country. ""We would hope they respect our jurisdiction,"" UFCW spokesman Jeff Ferro said. Teamsters organizer Kristin Heidelbach said there's no need for unions to battle each other. There will be plenty of workers needing representation as small cannabis businesses run by ""happy stoner"" types give way to large pharmaceutical corporations, she said. The green rush that begins in 2018 is an opportunity for unions to regain influence that began declining in the late 1950s, said David Zonderman, a professor of labour history at North Carolina State University. But discord between unions could upend it. As could resistance from cannabis-business leaders. ""Are they going to be new-age and cool with it,"" Mr. Zonderman said, ""or, like other business people, say, 'Heck, no. We're going to fight them tooth and nail?'"" Last year, California voters approved sales of recreational marijuana to those 21 and older at licensed shops beginning Jan. 1. Cannabis in California already is a $22-billion (U.S.) industry, including medical marijuana and a black market that accounts for most of that total, according to University of California, Davis, agriculture economist Philip Martin. Medical marijuana has been legal since 1996, when California was the first state to approve such a law. Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement Labour leaders estimate recreational pot in California could employ at least 100,000 workers from the north coast to the Sierra Nevada foothills and the San Joaquin Valley, harvesting and trimming the plants, extracting ingredients to put in liquids and edibles and driving it to stores and front doors. Other pot workers have organized in other states, but California should be especially friendly territory for unions, said Jamie Schau, a senior analyst with Brightfield Group, which does marketing analysis on the marijuana industry. The state has one of the country's highest minimum wages and the largest number of unionized workers across industries. Its laws also tend to favour employees. At least some workers say they're open to unions. ""I'm always down to listen to what could be a good deal for me and my family,"" said Thomas Grier, 44, standing behind the counter at Canna Can Help Inc., a dispensary in the Central Valley community of Goshen. The dispensary – with $7-million in yearly sales – sells medical marijuana. Story continues below advertisement Called a ""bud tender,"" Mr. Grier recently waited on a steady flow of regular customers walking through the door to pick out their favourite strain. So far, no unions have contacted him, he said. Mr. Grier gets along with his boss and said he doesn't want to pay union dues for help ironing out workplace disputes. But he hasn't discounted the possibility of joining. After recently entering the marijuana industry, Los Angeles resident Richard Rodriguez said one sticky traffic stop three months ago converted him into a ""hard core"" Teamster. He'd never been in a union until this year. Mr. Rodriguez said an officer pulled him over delivering a legal shipment of pot and detained him for 12 hours as he was accused of following too closely behind a truck. A union lawyer stepped in, and Mr. Rodriguez said he was released without being arrested or given a ticket. ""Most companies can't or are unwilling to do that,"" he said, ""because employees are easily replaced.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty-six states — including Sessions’ home state of Alabama — have legalized some form of medical marijuana in recent years, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Eight of those states also allow recreational marijuana. Among the guidance that Sessions rescinded was the so-called Ogden Memorandum of 2009 that instructed federal prosecutors not to pursue cases against medical marijuana patients and distributors who complied with state laws. “Previous nationwide guidance specific to marijuana enforcement is unnecessary and is rescinded, effective immediately,” Sessions told the U.S. attorneys based in all 50 states in a letter Thursday. Georgia state Rep. Allen Peake, a Republican who sponsored a bill in his state’s legislature that legalized possession of medical marijuana in 2015, denounced the move. “I’m very disappointed in Jeff Session’s actions,” Peake said Friday in a telephone interview. “He will be hurting the grandfather with Alzheimer’s, the soccer mom with breast cancer, the college student with Crohn’s disease, the young child with seizures — these are the people that will be impacted by this action by the attorney general.” The only legal protection now for medical marijuana growers, processors, sellers and users is a temporary measure sponsored by Republican California Rep. Dana Rohrabacher and Democratic Oregon Rep. Earl Blumenauer prohibiting the U.S. Department of Justice from using government funds to target them. Rohrabacher, in a conference call with reporters and four other members of Congress, said Sessions’ move should galvanize national support for marijuana legalization. “This is a wake-up call for American people who believe in freedom,” Rohrabacher said. “It will mobilize people throughout the country.” Many politicians, including Republicans, have cast Session’s move as an infringement on states’ rights. Only Idaho, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas do not allow any access to marijuana, said Karmen Hanson, a cannabis policy analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures. Twenty-nine states — plus Washington, D.C., and the U.S. territories of Guam and Puerto Rico — allow for comprehensive public medical marijuana programs. An additional 17 states allow use of marijuana products for medical reasons in limited situations or as a legal defense, she said. Many of the states that allow some form of medical marijuana with low THC — marijuana’s psychoactive compound — did so in 2013 and 2014. About half of the initiatives that allowed medical marijuana were passed by voters in ballot measures and the rest by state legislatures, Hanson said. Georgia’s General Assembly passed that state’s medical marijuana law in 2015. Called Haleigh’s Hope Act, it was named for a girl who was suffering from hundreds of seizures a day. “This means the world to us,” Haleigh’s mother, Janea Cox, told reporters when Georgia’s governor signed the bill. Peake said Sessions’ move will have a chilling effect on a bill he introduced that would allow the growing, processing and distribution of cannabis oil in Georgia. “This is as bipartisan an issue as you can get,” he said. “Cancer doesn’t ask if you’re a Republican or a Democrat. There are people of all races and creeds who benefit from medical cannabis, so that’s why it’s so crucial that Congress get together and take action.” The Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment that restricts U.S. attorneys from taking legal action against people who use medical marijuana or produce it was maintained in a last short-term funding bill passed by Congress. But that funding bill expires on Jan. 19. Blumenauer “is working to make sure it’s maintained again in whatever next funding bill Congress passes,” said his spokeswoman, Nicole L’Esperance. Rohrabacher said a better, more permanent solution is a bill he submitted last year that amends the Controlled Substances Act so it doesn’t apply to people who produce, possess or deliver marijuana in compliance with state marijuana laws. If it passes, Rohrabacher said he and Blumenauer would not be forced to repeatedly seek passage of their amendment annually. New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker has also introduced a bill to legalize marijuana at the federal level. ___ Follow Andrew Selsky on Twitter at https://twitter.com/andrewselsky ___ This version corrects that Peake has introduced the Georgia bill, not that he plans to.

In his memo Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions didn’t directly order a federal crackdown on pot enterprises. But it was vague enough to leave that possibility open. So while growers, sellers and their financial backers aren’t panicking, they know Sessions' move isn’t good for business. Sessions on Thursday rescinded an Obama-era guidance on federal intervention, essentially giving U.S. attorneys permission to aggressively enforce federal laws against marijuana. The order may unnerve small banks that have begun to take on cannabis companies as clients, analysts said. Entrepreneurs and investors thinking of getting into the business may now back out. And if federal agents move to prosecute even one company that is otherwise complying with state laws, it could raise fears of raids, prison terms and seized property. ""It may spook enough of the support ecosystem around the cannabis business that will make it extremely hard for business to go forward,"" said Sean O'Connor, who runs the Cannabis Law and Policy Project at the University of Washington School of Law. Federal law prohibits growing, buying and using marijuana. But a growing list of states have legalized marijuana in some form within their borders. Twenty-nine allow the use of marijuana for medical purposes, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Eight states — Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Washington — have approved laws allowing the sale of recreational marijuana, although recreational sales have not yet begun in all of those states. Customers purchase marijuana at Harborside, one of California's largest and oldest dispensary dispensaries of medical marijuana, on the first day of legalized recreational marijuana sales on January 1, 2018 in Oakland, California. Elijah Nouvelage / Reuters The Justice Department policy under the Obama administration sought to establish a balance between federal authority and states' rights. It instructed federal prosecutors to leave legal pot activity in states alone, except in cases that involved the sale of marijuana to children, across state lines, on federal land, or by gangs or organized crime. States saw the policy as a guide to keep the feds out of their business. Critics, however, viewed the Obama-era policy as giving ""safe harbor for the industry to operate,"" according to a senior Justice Department official. Protections for medical marijuana remain in effect under a piece of the federal spending law that prevents federal authorities from trying to curtail that aspect of the industry. Sessions, a longtime outspoken opponent of marijuana, has asked Congress to remove it when it comes up for reauthorization this year. State officials and industry leaders were defiant upon hearing the news of Sessions' new policy, saying it would have little long-term affect on the cannabis market, which they see as too big to fail. ""Never underestimate the power of hundreds of millions of people who want to buy cannabis,"" said Troy Dayton, CEO of the Arcview Group, an Oakland, California-based venture capital firm specializing in the marijuana market. His firm estimates that legal cannabis spending on recreational and medical pot totaled $8.6 billion in 2017. ""And never underestimate the power of states that don't want to give up their tax money,"" Dayton said. Tourist Laura Torgerson, visiting from Arizona, smells cannabis buds at the Green Pearl Organics dispensary on the first day of legal recreational marijuana sales in California on Jan. 1, 2018, in Desert Hot Springs. ROBYN BECK / AFP - Getty Images In Colorado, where the state pocketed more than $500 million in marijuana tax revenue last year, Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, said the Obama-era memo ""was foundational in guiding states’ efforts to regulate the production and distribution of marijuana."" In Oregon, which collected more than $60 million, Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum in a statement called Session's action an example of the administration's ""overreach"" and vowed to ""do everything within my legal authority to protect"" the state's pot industry. Sessions seemed to be aware of the political and legal danger of pushing too hard against states where voters have approved the legal sale of pot, and where governments have built regulatory structures around the new industry, analysts said. Most of those states are largely Democratic, and some have fought prior Trump administration's policies on immigration and health care. ""The unique thing about the marijuana industry, and capitalists in general, is they are activists, people who are not going to go down without a fight,"" said John Hudak, who studies marijuana policy at the Brookings Institution. ""A lot of them have too much to lose to shut down."" Glenn Ballman, CEO of düber, a technology platform that allows marijuana consumers and sellers to exchange information, said the cannabis market had been expecting such a move from the Justice Department since Sessions was appointed attorney general. ""Sessions could have been more aggressive,"" Ballman said, but added that without further guidance, ""there is a lot of uncertainty right now"" about whether small marijuana distributors will be allowed to thrive. Robert Mikos, an expert in federalism and drug law who teaches at Vanderbilt Law School, said Sessions' order could cause financial headaches for the industry. Banks, which are regulated by the federal government, have relied on the good will of the Justice Department to not punish them for providing services to cannabis businesses, Mikos said. Those institutions, mostly small entities, may now decide that it's not worth the risk. ""The removal of these memos is going to make the banks even more skittish,"" Mikos said. How skittish remains to be seen. One bank in the cannabis business, Salal Credit Union in Seattle, said in a statement that it was ""waiting to discuss potential impacts until we have a fuller understanding of the situation."" Another, Numerica Credit Union in Spokane Valley, Washington, said it was ""currently reviewing what actions, if any, that need to be taken with our canna business accounts."" Aaron Smith, executive director of the National Cannabis Industry Association, said Sessions' order ""doesn't instill a lot of confidence"" among financial institutions, ""but it's important to understand that nobody wants to see the cannabis industry operating outside of the banking system.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And that is very good news for South Africa’s farmers, struggling with drought, who are switching to a crop whose farm-gate price has risen 130 percent since 2008. Already, South Africa generates around 1.85 billion rand ($137 million) a year from avocados, producing around 125,000 tonnes and exporting more than half to Europe. In 2008, they fetched an average 9.64 rand (70 U.S. cents) per kg, in 2017 it was 22.10 rand. It takes six years to get an avocado plantation into production, but that is not putting farmers off. “Forestry plantations are being felled and cleared and avocados planted,” said Derek Donkin, chief executive of the South African Subtropical Growers’ Association. “There are also areas that were either bush or some grazing that’s been planted to avocados.” There are currently about 16,500 hectares (41,800 acres) of avocado plantations, and that area is growing by about 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres) a year. Traditionally, avocados were grown in humid sub-tropical climates in the Limpopo, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal provinces, but now they are being planted in the drier Eastern and Western Cape provinces. Techniques such as drip irrigation, which drips water slowly on the soil, and planting orchids on ridges to reduce surface run-off help to make the most of the water available. “Traditionally, no one would ever dream about planting down there, but you need to pioneer - much like this farm was pioneered more than 100 years ago,” said Craig Lewis, an executive at the producer HL Hall and Sons on a farm near the northern city of Nelspruit. The firm hopes that its trial plantation on the Western Cape - hit hard by drought this year - might allow it to extend what is now a six-month season to 10 months, to supply a global year-round demand. “Although South Africa is planting 1,000 hectares a year, we would like to plant a lot more,” Lewis said. Donkin said the rate could hit as much as 2,000 hectares a year within the next few years. On a smaller scale, Tom Mdluli manages 188 employees on a 6,000 hectare community farm in Mpumalanga province owned by a Trust. It exports around 80 percent of its 260 hectares’ worth of avocados - and is planning to expand by another 120 hectares. Even the wines famously grown on the Cape may one day have to move aside for the avocado. “They swap the annual crops like maize, cotton and alfalfa for more permanent crops,” said Wessel Lemmer, senior agricultural economist at Absa Bank. “They even take out vines.” ($1 = 13.4745 rand) Additional reporting by Nomvelo Chalumbira; Editing by James Macharia and Kevin Liffey",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And it's likely going to be roughest in British Columbia. While a shortage of Christmas trees in the United States is turning into an exporting boon for growers in Eastern and Central Canada, B.C. shoppers are expected to face stiffer prices and a more dismal selection of evergreens. ""People may not be able to buy the choice of trees they want,"" said Art Loewen, whose business, Pine Meadows Tree Farms in Chilliwack, supplies local garden centres. ""There will be enough trees, but they might not get the choice they want."" Story continues below advertisement But for Canadian growers, who suffered through a dark period seven years ago, when they faced a glut of trees from U.S. producers, things have rebounded. This fall's orders were exceptional, said Jimmy Downey, whose family farm, Sapinière Downey, is located in Hatley, in Quebec's Eastern Townships, an area southeast of Montreal that exports 85 per cent of its fir trees to the United States. This is the first year that most of Mr. Downey's sales were finalized many months before workers started cutting the trees. ""We try to run after our clients. This year, it was the opposite. The clients were running after us to get their trees,"" said Mr. Downey, who is president of growers' group the Association des producteurs d'arbres de Noël du Québec. ""It seems to be a really good year. We are selling to the max,"" said Shirley Brennan, executive director of the Canadian Christmas Tree Growers Association. The scarcity in the United States is, however, a concern in B.C., which relies on U.S. imports. Other parts of Canada are not expected to be affected and big chains such as Loblaw and IKEA said they will be properly supplied for the holiday season. The problem south of the border has been attributed to a delayed result of the recession that began in 2007. There were fewer sales, less harvesting and, as a result, U.S. growers planted fewer new trees, which need a decade to mature into adequate size. Mr. Downey said he had been getting more orders from Washington State, where dry conditions might have affected the tree crops. ""You end up with [what] we call a Charlie Brown tree … you only see a few needles and a trunk and branches. It's not appearing green, it won't give a nice smell in the house, it's not marketable."" Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement B.C. relies on imports from the United States as its limited agricultural land has pushed farmers toward higher-value crops, said Mr. Loewen, an executive with the B.C. Christmas Tree Council. ""We've never grown enough of our own and we've always imported a lot from the U.S. That has become tougher,"" he said. His business is growing fewer firs because he can't rent additional acreages any more. He has had to buy more trees from U.S. suppliers to keep up with the demand, but their prices have gone up. For example, noble firs that he used to buy for $30 or less a unit now cost $50 wholesale. In addition to higher prices, he said that instead of Fraser or balsam firs, retailers might have to sell grand firs, which don't keep their needles as well, Mr. Loewen said. In Nova Scotia, booming demand for real trees in the United States has many growers uncertain of whether they can cut enough trees this December to keep up with wholesale demand. Story continues below advertisement The province's Christmas tree industry is large and in the midst of a rebound after going through ""a rough period,"" said Angus Bonnyman, executive director of the Nova Scotia Christmas Tree Council. Increasingly, big-box retailers in both Canada and the United States have been turning to Nova Scotia growers to pick up the slack from large U.S. growers, he said. Whether that will translate into shortages and higher prices at retail tree lots is not yet clear. ""There should be a tree for everyone. We wouldn't want folks to panic,"" Mr. Bonnyman said, while suggesting in the same breath that shoppers buy their trees early. Mr. Bonnyman said there aren't reliable statistics on the number of trees sent to the United States versus other provinces, where trees are commonly given new tags of origin and sold again. Growers in Nova Scotia are independent and often family-owned; they are not compelled to disclose sales data. Even growers who supply the Canadian domestic market feel the pressure from a tree-starved U.S. market. Cindy Rhodenizer, who runs G.A.R. Tree Farms with her husband in Nova Scotia's Lunenburg County, supplies one main client, a big-box retailer with stores across Canada.

44,Portugal seduces parched investors with water: plenty of it,"As wildfires scorched California yet again this summer, Jose Dariush Leal da Costa, a Bay Area native with Portuguese roots, was harvesting his first almonds in a sun-drenched, watery oasis in southern Portugal.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-portugal-lake-business-widerimage/portugal-seduces-parched-investors-with-water-plenty-of-it-idUSKCN1LF104,2018-08-30T10:12:20Z,"ALQUEVA, Portugal (Reuters) - As wildfires scorched California yet again this summer, Jose Dariush Leal da Costa, a Bay Area native with Portuguese roots, was harvesting his first almonds in a sun-drenched, watery oasis in southern Portugal. The largest artificial lake in the European Union, the 250 square km (97 square miles) Alqueva, irrigates an area the size of Los Angeles, luring foreign investors at a time when climate change is fanning droughts from California to northern Europe. European fruit growers, Spanish olive oil makers, almond and berry farmers from California and Chile, and many others are moving in to rival local farmers on these irrigated lands, whose prices soared by 50 percent in the past five years. The 5 billion euro ($5.8 billion) irrigation project on the River Guadiana, begun two decades ago to revive a region at risk of desertification, is only now reaching its initial design capacity and there are plans to expand it further. It has also boosted income and jobs in the most disadvantaged region of Western Europe’s poorest country. “We have enough water to the point when I’m five years into a drought and not worried about water,” said Leal da Costa, noting that water scarcity was always a worry in California, the world’s largest almond producer, where farms compete for water resources with cities and industries. For a photo essay click on: reut.rs/2LE8mtb NEW CALIFORNIA? During a trip to the United States in June, Prime Minister Antonio Costa invited investors in California, which has a climate similar to Portugal, to set up shop around Alqueva in a pitch that played on concerns about global warming. “It was very effective. In California, land is very expensive and water is very scarce. If you have affordable land and tenable, affordable water, these are the incentives people need,” said Rusty Areias, a former California Assemblyman turned investor who met Costa during his visit. Areias has visited Alqueva and is talking to the government about water rights for potential U.S. investment, including his own, while encouraging farmers in parched Fresno county to diversify their business to Portugal, which is “uncongested and a lot like California was in the 1950s”. Seeking to boost economic growth after being hit by crisis in 2011, Portugal provides cheap loans and other incentives to investors ready to spend more than 500,000 euros and create jobs. The Alqueva project only this year reached the design goal of selling its water to 80 percent of the area it serves. State firm EDIA, which runs it, plans to expand irrigation coverage by over 40 percent to 170,000 hectares by 2022. Other Portuguese regions want similar irrigation projects, but Alqueva is unlikely to face competition from new schemes as EU rules that require sufficient clean water supplies for human needs have largely halted damming for agriculture. Alqueva has faced environmental complaints, with green groups warning that the flooded areas would destroy wildlife habitats, while the intensive agriculture it encourages would pollute groundwater and soil. Areas irrigated by Alqueva now stretch almost from the Atlantic coast to the Spanish border, creating what EDIA chief Jose Salema calls “a green barrier to desertification”, a phenomenon that threatens swathes of southern and central Europe. Salema says water consumption per hectare at Alqueva is half of what it had been designed for, thanks to more efficient growing and watering methods such as drip irrigation. Still, California investor Areias said water rights in Portugal still need to be made clearer to convince more cautious investors, who need guarantees of water supply for over 20 years. EDIA estimates foreign investors already work on an estimated 25,000 hectares, a quarter of all Alqueva-irrigated lands in use, having put 250 million euros into crops and equipment. RECORD CROPS, GETTING EARLY TO SHOPS Olives remain the area’s main crop, with yields that are four times the operating cost. Alqueva boosted olive oil output in Portugal, the world’s fourth largest exporter, to a record 147 million liters last year, official figures show. “There are more jobs, new crops, which is always great for the region,” said small-scale local farmer Helder Martins, whose beekeeping business has improved since almond growers started hiring his hives to pollinate their trees. Unemployment in the wider Alentejo region around Alqueva fell more sharply than anywhere else in Portugal last year to below the average national level, dropping to 8.4 percent. Almond plantations in the area doubled in size last year to more than 5,500 hectares, with foreign investors dominating new plantings. Fruit plantations have also expanded strongly to more than 1,000 hectares, helped by investment from Spain, Germany, and Switzerland. “We have plantations in various European countries and we see that many types of fruit grow a lot faster here,” said Joao Serrano, CEO of the Portuguese unit of Swiss-based Fairfruit Group. But nowhere may escape the impact of global warming for long. Portugal had its own deadly fires last year after a three-year drought, with a big blaze south of Alqueva this year. In a scenario of more frequent and longer droughts, an expanded Alqueva may no longer be sustainable by 2030-2040, requiring tough conservation efforts, said Prof. Ricardo Serralheiro of the University of Evora.

Gone is the noisy trading pit, replaced by a handful of buyers sitting behind their laptops in a silent auditorium. Armed with tasting notes, they bid electronically on hundreds of lots drawn from the city’s hilly hinterlands in Assam and West Bengal. To passing visitors, it appears as if everyone in the room could do with a little caffeination. Yet within only three hours or so, enough tea changes hands to brew 24 Olympic-sized swimming pools. If Indian tea delights those who get to drink the country’s finest blends, it frustrates all those who plant, pluck and peddle it. Archaic government regulations have in recent years pushed up production costs to around 175 rupees ($2.70) per kilogram, well above average auction prices of 140 rupees, which makes large cultivators grumble. Pickers complain about working conditions. Marketers fret over whether young people around the world thirst for tea as their parents do. Upgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors' Picks newsletters. For now, tea remains the most popular drink in the world after water. Around 40% of global production of black tea comes from India (China also grows the stuff but specialises in green tea, which uses the same species of plant but processes it differently). Many of the firms in the business can trace their heritage to well before Indian independence in 1947. Back then four out of five lots used to end up abroad; now the same proportion is drunk locally. That is due as much to sluggish exports as to rising domestic demand. Tea drinking in India has grown by less than 3% a year since 2012, and foreign sales have barely risen in 70 years; in some rich export markets they are shrinking. On the world scene India is behind Sri Lanka and Kenya, both relative newcomers. Government meddling, in the form of onerous, outdated rules, is mostly to blame for the industry’s worsening fortunes (although producers do also benefit from protection from imports). Regulations from the 1950s have heaped paternalistic obligations onto owners of large tea plantations. These mandate the number of workers and provide their families with schools, health care, subsidised food, electricity and so on. Labour now accounts for around half of production costs, a figure which has grown by 12% a year over the past three years. Despite that, few workers make more than $2 a day on top of their housing cost and other benefits, and child labour is rife—hence widespread discontent with conditions. Over time, new processing techniques have raised output, to 1.25m tons last year, but at the expense of quality. Tea leaves are now shredded into tiny bits, which generate lots of flavour but less of the subtlety for which Indian tea has been prized abroad (Indians boil rather than brew their tea and so tend to make do with lower-quality leaves). Improvised small-time growers, some of them with barely a few plants, have sprouted, further denting quality. With much lower costs, given they carry none of the social obligations of large plantations, these small producers now make up nearly half the market, from barely nothing at the turn of the century. Traditional producers have tried to find ways to adapt. Giants like Hindustan Unilever or Tata have focused on marketing and selling the stuff to tea-drinkers rather than just growing it and selling it wholesale. Others have invested heavily abroad; McLeod Russel, the world’s biggest producer, last year made enough profits in Uganda, Vietnam and Rwanda to offset losses in India. Another large producer, Rossell India, has diversified into kebab shops and making military kit. Many would like to use their tea land for other purposes, but this is forbidden by government regulation. The resulting overproduction of lower-quality tea has depressed prices and profits (though a bad harvest in Kenya has recently nudged up prices). It also bodes ill for future exports. According to ICRA, a credit-rating agency, the country’s nine biggest planters combined made no profit in the most recent financial year, ending in March 2017. Few producers are making the investments that are needed to raise productivity by uprooting old bushes and planting new ones. Tea marketers’ hope is to nudge consumers both in India and abroad to slurp pricier brews, moving them from loose tea to tea bags, canned iced tea or premium blends. Their plan is in its early stages, and a short-term setback came this summer when a three-month agitation by local separatists in the Darjeeling area of West Bengal, which grows what is considered the country’s finest tea, resulted in perhaps 40% of the year’s revenue being lost. Yet the biggest gripe in the industry is not to do with prices, quality or even heavy-handed regulation. Customers, especially millennials, increasingly lack the patience to make a proper cup of tea, laments Krishan Katyal, the boss of J Thomas. The leaves need at least three minutes to release their complex aromas, beyond an eternity for youngsters these days. Like a master distiller told of a single malt being mixed with Coca-Cola, he winces at the thought of drinkers squeezing their tea bag after merely a few seconds. “That poor thing,” he says. “It never got a chance.” This article appeared in the Business section of the print edition under the headline ""Strange brew""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,"Legalizing Marijuana Nationwide Would Create One Million Jobs, Study Says","With federal legalization, there would be 782,000 jobs created immediately, a report said.",http://www.newsweek.com/legal-marijuana-create-one-million-jobs-decade-778960,2018-01-11T23:29:48Z,"Legalizing marijuana nationwide would create more than one million new jobs within the next decade, a new study says. Analysis from New Frontier Data, a firm that focuses on the marijuana industry, also found that the federal government would create at least $131.8 billion in federal tax revenue over the next eight years if cannabis were legalized in all 50 states. With federal legalization, there would be 782,000 jobs created immediately, and the firm forecasts that the number would increase to 1.1 million by 2025, including growers and retailers. Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now In 2015, a year after Colorado legalized recreational cannabis sales, the legal marijuana industry created 18,000 full-time jobs and $2.4 billion in economic growth in the state, according to the Marijuana Policy Group. New Frontier suggested this trend could be sustainable on a national level. A customer purchases cannabis products at the Green Pearl Organics dispensary on the first day of legal recreational marijuana sales in California on January 1. ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images “If cannabis businesses were legalized tomorrow and taxed as normal businesses with a standard 35 percent tax rate, cannabis businesses would infuse the U.S. economy with an additional $12.6 billion this year,” New Frontier CEO Giadha Aguirre De Carcer told the Washington Post. The economic growth would be pushed by increased demand on various industries, according to the Marijuana Policy Group. Farmers need warehouse space, and they purchase specialized equipment like lighting and irrigation for marijuana growth. Retailers rely on contractors and book-keeping services to run businesses. In states like Washington and Colorado, legal recreational marijuana has also led to a boost in some tourism sectors. California became the eighth state to sell legal recreational marijuana on January 1, and 29 states now allow medical marijuana. Federal legalization, while popular across nearly every demographic group in the U.S., is facing renewed challenges from U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whose strong opposition to statewide marijuana laws has slowed the bipartisan push. Sessions last week rescinded an Obama-era rule that told federal prosecutors to leave marijuana alone in states that legalized it, leaving open questions about the future of the burgeoning industry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,Greece's Olive Oil Industry Offers a Lesson on Economic Hurdles,"Greek olive oil should be a shining example of the country’s export sector. Instead, it offers a lesson in why Greece remains deeply uncompetitive despite years of pressure to fix its economy.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/greeces-olive-oil-industry-offers-a-lesson-on-economic-hurdles-1513593001,2017-12-18T12:22:55Z,"STREFI, Greece—Workers at Yiannis Skiadas ’ mountainside mill pressed prized Kalamata olives on a recent day to extract the thick, fragrant oil known regionally as “green gold”—most of which would get shipped abroad in bulk and blended into Italian olive oil. Mr. Skiadas could earn almost three times as much by branding his oil and selling it himself. But that would require investing in every step from cultivation to marketing, and quick cash from Italian customers is appealing after a decade of economic pain in Greece. “Thank God for the Italians,” he said. Greek olive oil should be a shining example of the country’s export sector. Instead, it offers a lesson in why Greece remains deeply uncompetitive despite years of pressure to fix its economy. Greece has what should be significant competitive advantages, including a climate that is favorable for agriculture and a 22% drop in labor costs since 2010, around the start of the Greek debt crisis. But the country has been unable to leverage its low cost base to pull itself out of economic malaise. The value of Greek exports fell last year, despite years of efforts aimed at promoting export-led growth. Just 2.5% of Greek enterprises are involved in export activity, according to a recent survey by Ernst &amp; Young. Bank lending is scarce in a country mired in debt. And Greece’s notoriously inefficient bureaucracy makes it time-consuming to secure health and safety approvals and export paperwork, according to Greek exporters. Similar problems affect other Greek agricultural products from peaches to wine. Exports of textiles and household appliances have also slipped in recent years. The failure of Greece’s olive-oil makers to break into the international market for branded oil is especially painful. Greece is the world’s No. 3 producer of olive oil, according to Eurostat, but just 4% of branded olive oil sold world-wide is Greek, according to a 2015 report by the National Bank of Greece. The reason: Greek olive-oil producers have mostly stuck to making bulk oil, unable or unwilling to invest in making the branded product that can command lofty prices in foreign markets. Only 27% of Greek olive oil is exported as a branded product, compared with 50% from Spain and 80% from Italy. “Greece hasn’t invested to create a brand name, as have Italy and Spain,” says Christina Sakellaridi, who heads the Greek Exporters Association. “Now it’s difficult to compete with them.” By sticking with bulk oil rather than branded oil, Greece is foregoing about EUR250 million in revenue each year, according to the National Bank of Greece report, money the capital-starved country desperately needs. Many Greek olive farms and mills are family-operated and have fewer than 10 employees, according to olive-growers’ associations. Their small size leaves them with little of the money and management skill needed to upgrade their products and establish a brand name. For those who do invest, the payoff can be significant. Before the crisis, Georgios Skarpalezos sank money into new machinery for his mill. Now he makes extra virgin olive oil that he sells in, among other places, London’s Harrods department store. He makes as much as EUR4 a liter, while a middleman, usually an oil-mill owner, might make as little as 10 to 20 euro cents a liter on bulk oil. “I cannot produce huge quantities, because I have to focus on the quality of the product,” said Mr. Skarpalezos, showing dark glass bottles designed to safeguard the oil. Olive-oil producers also often need to import products such as Mr. Skarpalezos’ glass bottles and plastic caps. To produce bottled extra virgin olive oil, local farms would have to pay an agronomist to check their fields at least twice a year to make sure they are disease-free and send soil and olive samples to labs to check the type of fertilizers or herbicides used. The trees would have to be irrigated and pruned according to specific rules. Because of the difficulty in borrowing money, Mr. Skiadas said he and his suppliers also can’t spend to upgrade their final product. Many, for instance, don’t buy crates or fabric sacks designed to keep picked olives fresher, sticking instead with plastic sacks that lack ventilation. Mr. Skiadas also shuns the cold-press method that mills must use to label their product virgin or extra virgin olive oil, instead pressing the olives at high temperatures because that yields up to twice as much oil. Mr. Skiadas believes that the quality of the product is the same. “All these intermediate steps lead to a rise in our costs,” he said.

Today, it serves as the capital of Peru’s war on drugs. Clandestine airstrips etched into the jungle make the area a hub for smugglers. They form part of an “air bridge”, with small planes flying in from Bolivia to pick up cocaine paste or refined cocaine, stopping in Bolivia to refuel and then heading to Brazil, from which the drug is dispatched to Europe. A single plane can carry 300kg (660lb) of cocaine, worth some $350,000. Peru and Bolivia, which co-operate to disrupt the air bridge, are an odd anti-drug duo. Peru is a partner of the United States, from which it gets $120m a year to fight the narcotics trade. Bolivia’s president, Evo Morales, once led a coca growers’ union and in 2008 expelled the United States’ Drug Enforcement Administration. Both countries allow some coca cultivation (for traditional uses like chewing). Bolivia nearly doubled the area on which farmers can grow coca to 22,000 hectares in 2017. Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. The United States has “decertified” Bolivia’s anti-drug programme every year since 2008 and contends that Bolivia, like Venezuela, has “failed demonstrably” to carry out international and American drug-control policies. Yet Peru is the bigger producer. It grows enough coca to make 410 tonnes of cocaine a year, while Bolivia’s potential is 275 tonnes. Most of the cocaine seized in Bolivia comes from Peru. Neither country is winning the battle against it. In Peru, smugglers restore airstrips as soon as police dynamite them, says Héctor Loayza, the general in charge of Dirandro, the anti-narcotics agency. Bolivia has more aircraft and airstrips, in part because “air taxis” are used as transport in forested areas, such as the Beni department. Dirandro and FELCN, Bolivia’s anti-drug police, identified hundreds of flights in the first half of this year but seized only six planeloads of drugs, partly because of the time it takes to scramble helicopters. Sometimes the narcs’ perseverance beats the smugglers’ ingenuity. Last October Mr Loayza’s agents found 1.3 tonnes of cocaine that had been shaped into irrigation pipes. But such successes are exceptions. FELCN and Dirandro each interdicted only around ten tonnes of coca-based products in the first half of 2018. Marco Ibáñez, FELCN’s chief, complains that his force of 1,400 agents is about “one agent per airstrip”. Policing Bolivia’s 1,000km (620-mile) border with Peru, as well as its 3,300km border with Brazil, is a “struggle”. Both agency chiefs plead for more manpower. Even more important, they say, would be authorisation to shoot down suspected drug flights. “All we need is the green light, and the next day” smugglers will abandon the air bridge, says Mr Loayza. He points out that, in 2016, traffickers mistakenly thought that two aircraft had been shot down. The drug flights “disappeared for two months”, he says. If the governments had their way, their agents would get that tool. Bolivia approved a law in 2014 that allows air interdiction. The defence minister, Javier Zabaleta, said in July this year that it would be implemented as soon as a new radar system was operational. Peru passed a similar law in 2015. In fact, neither country is likely to shoot down drug flights. The United States has been opposed to the tactic since 2001, when Peru mistakenly downed a plane carrying American missionaries. The European Union will dissuade Bolivia, to which it gives €35m ($40m) a year in anti-drug aid. Shoot-down laws violate international law, wrote Alonso Gurmendi Dunkelberg, a legal scholar, last year. Besides, the practice would encourage armed groups to chaperone drug shipments overland, spreading criminality. A better idea, until drugs are legalised, would be to strengthen co-operation between Peru and Bolivia. Peru, for example, does not share intelligence. The United States could encourage teamwork, by treating Bolivia not as an enemy, but as an ally in the drug war.

49,"Wines of The Times: 2016 Dry German Rieslings: Graceful, Resonant, Delicious","The label terminology can be confusing and confounding, but the best wines speak a universal language.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/dining/drinks/wine-review-2016-dry-german-rieslings.html,2018-05-03T15:12:03Z,"The problem is, the newer terminology is not consistent through all German regions. Many producers who belong to certain growers’ associations have adopted the term “grosses gewächs” to indicate dry wines from individual vineyards deemed exceptional. But that phrase is not employed in the Rheingau region, where the preferred term is “erstes gewächs.” Meanwhile, erstes gewächs should not be confused with “erste lage,” which indicates wines from sites that aspire to grosses gewächs status but have yet to earn the designation. Nor should grosses gewächs be confused with “grosse lage,” indicating wines from top sites that are not dry. And definitely don’t confuse grosse lage with grosslage, an old term meaning that a wine comes from several vineyards in a particular town rather than one vineyard, or einzellage. Not surprisingly, many producers choose to use the simpler trocken designation. Perhaps it is unfair sport to remark on the confusing nature of German wine labels. But I mention it because the wine panel recently tasted 20 bottles of dry German riesling from the largely excellent 2016 vintage. The tasting was blind, which spared us from the daunting label verbiage. But anybody examining the list of our 10 favorites will require a decoding device. For the tasting, Florence Fabricant and I were joined by Sabra Lewis, beverage director at L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon. We usually aim for two guests, but our second was a casualty of the New York region’s dysfunctional transit system, so we went ahead with just the three of us. Although Germany’s sweet rieslings are singular and among the treasures of the wine world, its dry rieslings can be equally wonderful and are likewise unlike those from anywhere else. Rieslings from Austria generally feel firmer, denser and more penetrating, while those from Alsace are altogether bigger and more voluminous. If I can speak generally about dry German rieslings, which can vary considerably depending on which region they come from, they are often far more delicate in texture than the others, precise and jewel-like rather than rich. By many accounts, difficult weather made the 2016 vintage tough to manage for many growers, but it produced wines of exceptional balance that amplify many of the best traits of dry German rieslings. The wines we liked best were deep and profoundly mineral, while also resonant and refreshing. What do I mean by resonant? These are wines that feel three-dimensional in the mouth. They have length — their flavors proceed in a linear fashion and last long after you swallow — and depth, which suggests the sort of complexity that makes you want to taste the wine again and again in an effort to unravel the flavors. But these are also young wines, and the more ambitious among them will benefit from aging five to 10 years to allow these complexities to uncoil while mellowing the rippling acidity. Sabra wondered whether some of them would ever relax, and suggested that maybe 20 years would do it. I don’t think it will take that long, but the best of these wines are well worth giving some time. Not all of the wines were exceptional, however. Balance was sometimes an issue. We rejected some wines that were overbearingly acidic — punishingly tart and lacking charm. That’s an old complaint about dry German rieslings, and one I was surprised to find might still have legitimacy. The good far outweighed the bad, however. Sabra called it a transparent vintage, meaning that the wines were quite expressive of their terroirs. And we found some excellent values, wines that are delicious right now. Top among them was our best value, a trocken from Schloss Mühlenhof in Rheinhessen — juicy, zesty and, if not complex, immensely satisfying, and just $13 for a liter. Right behind it was the Blauschiefer trocken from Stein in the Mosel, likewise lively, juicy and stony and just $19, albeit for a 750-milliliter bottle. While lovely bottles, these two predictably lacked the depth and nuance of our top (and more expensive) wines. Our No. 1 bottle was the Forster Ungeheuer grosses gewächs from von Winning in the Pfalz. Earthy, lively and multidimensional, the wine is a pleasure to drink now, but will get even better with time. If, by the way, you ever want to read some entertaining promotional wine writing, check out von Winning’s American importer, Terry Theise, who describes this wine in his 2017 catalog like this: “firm and caramelly, shiitakes, goose fat, but all in a heaving jiggling orgy of hedonism and licentiousness.” I’m afraid multidimensional is all you will get from me. No. 2 was the Lorcher Krone from Eva Fricke in the Rheingau, tightly coiled yet graceful and full of energy. Our No. 3 bottle was the Dalsheim Hubacker grosses gewächs from Keller in Rheinhessen, rich and succulent, with apricot and mineral flavors. Just behind these wines were the stony, tangy Haardter Herrenletten from Müller-Catoir in the Pfalz, the balanced energetic Maximin Klosterlay erste lage from Carl Loewen in the Mosel and the fresh, floral Dhroner Hofberg from A.J. Adam in the Mosel. Also well worth noting were the Marienburg Fahrlay grosses gewächs from Clemens Busch in the Mosel and the “Detonation” from Immich-Batterieberg, also in the Mosel. It’s important to emphasize that this was a fragmentary tasting, simply a cross-section of the 2016 vintage. We did not have many bottles from the Nahe region, where the ’16s have been especially lauded; and in a land of many small producers, you can look well beyond our top 10 to find wonderful bottles. Just know that they are well worth seeking out. And, if you are uncertain about which words indicate that a wine is dry beyond the all-purpose trocken, the alcohol level is often a dead giveaway. The sweet wines, in which all the sugar in the juice was not converted to alcohol in fermentation, are usually less than 10 percent alcohol. These dry bottles were 11.5 to 13 percent.

(Louis/Dressner Selections, New York) Recipe: Blanquette of Scallops Crisp, savory dry German rieslings can accompany all sorts of dishes, but they’re best paired with spring. And for me that means discarding dark sauces and turning toward ingredients that are light and green. Here I’m inspired by the French blanquette, a stew, usually veal, in a creamy white sauce. I replaced the veal with plump sea scallops and brightened the whole thing with verdant, seasonal asparagus. Traditionally a blanquette is thickened with egg yolks and has pearl onions and often button mushrooms in the mix. The onion is in my version, but minced. I also omitted the mushrooms and used new potatoes that, unlike the mushrooms, help thicken a sauce made without the egg yolks. The result is a dish that’s fancy enough for guests, yet easy enough for a weeknight. Just be sure to open that refreshing bottle of dry riesling alongside.

(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) President Trump and his chief environmental enforcer, Scott Pruitt, share many similarities when it comes to communicating with those outside the government. Both denounce news reports that scrutinize their behavior. Both gravitate toward giving interviews with sympathetic, right-leaning outlets. Here's another: an affinity for snail mail. The Environmental Protection Agency chief diligently writes thank-you notes to the many business executives, lobbyists, politicians and other government officials with whom he meets. The letters, many of them written by hand, offer a glimpse into the networking skills of an EPA administrator closely tied with some officials from industries his agency regulates. Pruitt's penchant for penning notes to associates is one he shares with his boss, Trump, who as a private businessman often scribbled praise and admonishment on news articles before sending them along to those in and outside the Trump Organization. Environmental groups have looked with suspicion on the dearth of email correspondence from Pruitt that has been dredged up in open-records requests. They ask how such an active EPA administrator could send so few emails. But the thank-you notes sent by Pruitt last year — included in a batch of newly released documents from the Sierra Club, which sued the EPA for access to Pruitt's correspondence under the Freedom of Information Act — show the 50-year-old bureaucrat may just prefer pre-Internet ways of staying in touch. Last year, Pruitt sent thank-you notes to a wide range of executives, including top ones at the National Association of Wheat Growers, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the American Gas Association, BP, Chevron and the American Petroleum Institute. Pruitt had spoken at a March 2017 board dinner held by that last group, the nation's largest oil and gas industry association. Afterward, Pruitt wrote to API's president, Jack Gerard, saying that he “appreciate[d] your hospitality and engagement.” “I've commented to many since then that it's the first time my button down group ever broke out in spontaneous applause for a speaker,” Gerard wrote to Pruitt in his own handwritten note. Note sent by American Petroleum Institute chief executive Jack Gerard to Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt following a dinner meeting last year. (EPA via The Sierra Club) Khary Cauthen, API's senior director of federal affairs, said such a meeting with top-level government officials is typical during any administration. “API routinely welcomes incoming administrations – democrat and republican – and engages in discussions with them on ways that America’s natural gas and oil industry can continue to contribute to American jobs, economic growth, national security and benefits for consumers,"" Cauthen wrote by email. (He also received a letter from Pruitt last year.) In early 2017, Richard Smotkin, Pruitt's longtime friend and a former Comcast lobbyist, arranged a meeting between Pruitt and former Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper. Pruitt later wrote to Harper to thank him for “the opportunity to discuss various policy matters.” Both men have been accused of trying to curtail climate-change research under their purview. Thank-you note sent from Pruitt to former Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper. (EPA via The Sierra Club) Smotkin, the lobbyist, later helped orchestrate Pruitt's controversial trip to Morocco to promote the export of U.S. liquefied natural gas, an activity normally overseen by the Energy Department. Pruitt used thank-you notes to not only forge new relationships, to maintain old ones as well. “Truly, visiting with you and our friends with DEPA blessed and encouraged me,” Pruitt wrote to his longtime ally, Harold Hamm, the chief executive of the Oklahoma-based driller Continental Resources. “DEPA” refers to the Domestic Energy Producers Alliance, an industry group that Hamm chairs. As that state's attorney general, Pruitt sued the Obama administration with DEPA over endangered species listings. Pruitt personalized the typed letter with a quick handwritten postscript before sending it off: ""Appreciate you!” Another April 2017 note sent by Pruitt to oil and gas driller and Trump booster Harold Hamm.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) — Drip, drip, drip: The holiday was no respite for the never-ending trickle of reports about Pruitt. Here are some highlights from the latest revelations: The EPA chief called on the president to replace the Attorney General Jeff Sessions with him — at least temporarily, CNN reports. Pruitt wanted to head the Justice Department under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act for up to 210 days, and then go back to his home state of Oklahoma to run for office, per the report. CNN added: “Advisers quickly shot down the proposal, but it came at a time when Trump's frustration with Sessions over his decision to recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation had resurfaced."" For his part, Pruitt denies that this happened. ""This report is simply false. General Sessions and I are friends and I have always said I want nothing more than to see him succeed in his role,"" he said in a statement, according to Reuters. Pruitt hired former political ally Elizabeth Beacham White as the director of the agency’s Office of the Executive Secretariat, Politico reports. Some are warning that White, who previously worked as the treasurer for Pruitt’s political action committee, could have a conflict in her role in charge of the office responsible for responding to Freedom of Information Act requests about Pruitt's lobbying meetings and other information. Indeed, the office has tightened its grip on sensitive information being released about the agency under Pruitt. With Pruitt at the head of the EPA, oil and gas drillers in Utah finally acquired long-sought exemptions from regulations around smog and ozone pollution, Politico also reports. Meanwhile, the watchdog group American Oversight is calling on a federal court to probe a report from CNN that Pruitt and his aides have kept “secret” calendars for the administrator. —And the conservative pushback continues. Fox News anchor Laura Ingraham is once again calling for Pruitt's ouster: Pruitt is the swamp. Drain it. — Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) July 3, 2018 — Is the administrator reaching the end of the line? A top administration official said Pruitt is “inching toward the tipping point,” CNN reports. For the umpteenth time, a White House spokesman said the final decision about Pruitt’s fate lies with the president, who is carefully ""looking into those"" reports, per deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley. The Post's Josh Dawsey adds: Trump is frustrated with EPA head Scott Pruitt, per two senior admin officials. But he hasn't focused on the issue that much because of North Korea, SCOTUS, etc, both officials said. That more than anything is saving Pruitt. — Josh Dawsey (@jdawsey1) July 4, 2018 The logo for Harley-Davidson appears above a trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) — Tariff woes: Trump’s tear against Harley-Davidson continued with a Tuesday tweet criticizing what he described as lower sales since the motorcycle maker said it would shift parts of its operations out of the United States. Now that Harley-Davidson is moving part of its operation out of the U.S., my Administration is working with other Motor Cycle companies who want to move into the U.S. Harley customers are not happy with their move - sales are down 7% in 2017. The U.S. is where the Action is! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2018 Why this tweet makes no sense: “Harley-Davidson made the announcement on June 25 that it would be moving some operations overseas in response to high tariffs the European Union is imposing on the motorcycles, The Post’s Damian Paletta explained. ""It could not be learned why Trump was linking the company’s 2017 sales figures to a decision it made in the middle of 2018.""

The extension will cover hotel and motel rooms for 20 more days for the about 950 families still receiving the relief, after a June 30 deadline was extended to July 4 at midnight, the New York Times reports. Pedestrians cross a shimmering Pennsylvania Avenue as temperatures soar into the 90's in Washington. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post) — Man, it’s a hot one: Areas around the world saw major weather records broken last week. “No single record, in isolation, can be attributed to global warming. But collectively, these heat records are consistent with the kind of extremes we expect to see increase in a warming world,” The Post’s Jason Samenow writes. Here are some highlights from just North America, per Samenow: — And that scorching nationwide heat wave has also led to a rise in electricity demand in parts of the Mid-Atlantic, Bloomberg News reports. The PJM Interconnection saw 144,557 megawatts of use by mid-Tuesday, the highest use since August 12 2016, per the report. A helicopter transports water to contain the Weston Pass Fire near Fairplay, Colo. (Hugh Carey/Summit Daily News via AP) And out West: There are nearly five dozen active wildfires burning in the Western United States, according to the Associated Press, including nine in New Mexico and six each in California, Colorado and Utah. And state officials were worried prior to the Fourth of July holiday over the “possibility of campfires or fireworks starting new fires because of the dry, hot conditions,” according to the AP. Extra precautions meant that many park areas, national forests were closed and fireworks displays were canceled to prevent further fires. — Cooler ocean = fewer hurricanes: OK, here's some good weather news. Atlantic waters are cooler this year, which could mean fewer extreme storms that shut down oil and natural gas operations in the hurricane-prone Gulf of Mexico region. Colorado State University has already dropped its predictions from 14 named storms down to 11, Bloomberg News reports. — ""REDUCE PRICING NOW:"" Trump took to Twitter to yet again put pressure on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to respond to high oil prices with more output. The demand follows a meeting where the oil group’s members decided to increase oil production, and follows assurance from Saudi Arabia that it would be able to increase output as needed with a capacity of 2 million more barrels a day. The OPEC Monopoly must remember that gas prices are up &amp; they are doing little to help. If anything, they are driving prices higher as the United States defends many of their members for very little $’s. This must be a two way street. REDUCE PRICING NOW! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 4, 2018 The truth: While a major oil suppler can move the needle, gasoline prices are ultimately set by a number of geopolitical and economic forces outside the control of a single country or cartel. In fact, Iran's oil ministry told Trump to stop tweeting, according to Bloomberg News : “Your tweets have driven the prices up by at least $10 per barrel. Pls stop it, otherwise it will go even higher!” A parking lot of predominantly new Tesla Model 3 electric vehicles is seen in Richmond, Calif. (REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo) — The road ahead for Tesla: The electric carmaker has reached its production target of 5,000 Model 3 sedans a week, after initially setting that goal for the end of last year, The Post’s Drew Harwell reports. The company has since been racing against the clock and a series of production-related delays, but ""some analysts questioned whether the youngest and most valuable U.S. automaker could sustain the Model 3 production long term,” Harwell reports. — However: The company’s chief executive ordered employees to halt a key brake test as it worked toward the production goal, Business Insider reports — though it is unclear for how long. The so-called the brake-and-roll test ""is a critical part of the car manufacturing process, taking place during its final stages,” per the report. “The test ensures that the car's wheels are perfectly aligned and checks the brakes and their function."" A green traffic light shines in front of the Volkswagen logo outside the company's headquarters in Wolfsburg, northern Germany. (Swen Pfoertner/dpa via AP) — Will an electric future erase “Dieselgate” woes? “Three years after revelations of the Dieselgate emissions cheating scandal, the VW brand desperately needs an image upgrade, particularly in its home market of Germany, where the scandal has cut deep into national pride and consumer goodwill,” the Wall Street Journal reports. “VW’s pitch is that it will lead in global vehicle electrification, eventually.” Coming Up The House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water, Power and Oceans holds a legislative hearing on proper administration of water facilities on July 11.

For an earlier morning read on exponentially more races — and for a more comprehensive aggregation of the day's most important campaign news — sign up for Campaign Pro today. ( http://www.politicopro.com/proinfo ) Welcome to another election edition of Score. Tonight, we have a lot of big races that will be decided in Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, the special election in Ohio’s 12th District and Washington state. Check POLITICO at around 7:15 p.m. Eastern for a live chat featuring your favorite election team (that’s the Campaign Pro team, if you were confused). Polls close first in Ohio at 7:30 p.m. Story Continued Below With that many races up for grabs, POLITICO’s Steve Shepard and Elena Schneider outline the things you should watch tonight. The first comes in the OH-12 matchup between Republican Troy Balderson and Democrat Danny O’Connor. The race “will test the potency of boiling down a House race to two candidates not on the ballot: Donald Trump and Nancy Pelosi, a pair of polarizing figures that each party hopes will drive turnout. Trump campaigned alongside Balderson last weekend, aiming to juice support for the state senator in a race that’s tightened into single digits, according to public and private polling. … Republicans also tried to tie Democrat Danny O’Connor to Nancy Pelosi in TV ads, a strategy the GOP has used in special elections throughout the last year and is prepared to replicate in the fall.” Trump’s primary power will also be put to the test. Trump waded into the Kansas GOP gubernatorial primary, endorsing longtime supporter Kris Kobach in a Monday tweet as he tries to oust Gov. Jeff Colyer. Trump waded into the race despite the fact that he had “been urged to stay on the sidelines by the Republican Governors Association and some White House advisers, who fear that Kobach could be defeated in a general election.” Trump also endorsed in two Michigan primaries: state Attorney General Bill Schuette in the gubernatorial contest and John James for Senate. The battle for the future of the Democratic party will continue tonight, as progressives try to secure some victories. Both Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsed Abdul El-Sayed, who is running for governor in Michigan, and Brent Welder, who is running in Kansas’ 3rd District. El-Sayed has trailed the establishment-backed Gretchen Whitmer in polling, while “Republicans are confident they can paint [Welder] as out-of-step with a traditionally Republican area that has recoiled at Trump’s GOP.” — A grab bag of the remaining races to watch: In WA-08, Republican Dino Rossi is expected to emerge from the jungle primary, but what Democrat will join him in this battleground seat? What Republican will face Democrat Paul Davis (who ran unopposed) in KS-02, another battleground? Which Democrats will win the primaries in MI-09 and MI-13 and become a likely member of Congress in a safe blue district? And what will the general election matchup be in the MI-11 battleground?

Upcoming election dates — Aug. 11: Hawaii primaries. — Aug. 14: Minnesota, Wisconsin, Connecticut, Vermont primaries. TALKING TARIFFS — Republican leaders worried that the president’s tariffs could come into play in some battleground districts — for example, in Minnesota’s 1st District. The Minneapolis Star Tribune’s Judy Keen : “Farmers, particularly soybean growers, have been hurt by retaliatory tariffs imposed by China and other countries after they were hit with U.S. levies on imports such as steel and aluminum. No top-tier candidates in the district — including Republican primary rivals Jim Hagedorn of Blue Earth and state Sen. Carla Nelson of Rochester — unreservedly endorse the tariffs. These misgivings are one way they’re trying to demonstrate that they’re attuned to rural voters’ worries and priorities.” BIG SPENDING ALERT — The League of Conservation Voters and United Steelworkers have teamed up to spend $3.1 million on voter mobilization in four battleground Senate seats. Campaign Pro’s James Arkin : “The money will go to Arizona and Nevada — Democrats' two best opportunities to flip Senate seats this cycle — as well as Montana and Ohio, two races featuring Democratic incumbents. The partnership will be run through the joint New American Jobs Fund, according to a press release. It will focus on voter persuasion and turnout, but will include some digital and TV advertising and direct mail. The groups aim to contact 106,000 voters in Phoenix; 106,000 voters in Las Vegas and Henderson, Nevada; and 58,000 voters in Cincinnati, Ohio and the surrounding county.” MIDTERM MESSAGING — How do you rally the president’s supporters without mentioning him by name? POLITICO New Jersey’s Matt Friedman : “Republicans in several hotly contested New Jersey congressional races are keeping an arm's length from President Donald Trump — who remains deeply unpopular in the state — while at the same time using the president’s immigration policies to gin up his base. … ‘These Trump voters will come out and vote if Trump is on the ballot,’ Monmouth University pollster Patrick Murray said. ‘So how do you find a way to make them feel that at least there’s a referendum on Trump at stake here without turning off the moderate voters who would normally vote Republican and who are turned off by Trump?’” SCOTUS BATTLE — America First Policies, a Trump-aligned outside group, is kicking seven figures into the Supreme Court battle. POLITICO’s Chris Cadelago : The group “will take to broadcast TV beginning Wednesday with ads against Sens. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, according to information the group provided to POLITICO. America First plans to spend nearly $1.2 million over the nearly month-long blitz, expanding on the parallel efforts of other deep pocketed conservative groups”. — Americans for Prosperity said it’s reached over 1 million Americans through direct mail, telephone calls or door knocks urging them to support Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination. WAY DOWNBALLOT — The Democratic primary race for New York attorney general has turned into a microcosm of the battle for the future of the party. The Atlantic’s Russell Berman : “The Democrats are all, to one degree or another, running on the explicit promise of taking on Trump and protecting New Yorkers from his administration’s conservative policies. They’re seizing on the unexpected opening of a plum elected perch with a big national spotlight, and on the desire of progressive voters — already energized for the midterm congressional elections — to fight the president in whatever way they can. But the attorney general’s race is also caught up in a turbulent New York political moment, one that pits veterans of the state’s Democratic establishment against insurgents trying to push the party to the left.” Separately, Yahoo News’ Hunter Walker reported that “the race is on Trump’s mind, and he has asked allies in New York for opinions about the candidates.” FUNDRAISING MACHINE — Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke continues to raise money at an incredible clip in his bid to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). On the heels of Cruz releasing his first ads (some of which attacked O’Rourke), O’Rourke’s campaign said he raised north of $1.27 million dollars over the weekend. WHAT’S IN A NAME? — In one of the more novel races this cycle, Kansas Republican Rep. Ron Estes is facing a primary challenge from … Ron M. Estes. BuzzFeed News’ Alexis Levinson on how the candidates are trying to distinguish themselves in this Ron-eat-Ron world: “The Facebook ads that the congressman is running in the final week of the campaign feature an image of the ballot, with Ron M. Estes — who will appear first on the ballot — blocked out in red with a big X next to his name. The congressman, on the second ballot line, is highlighted in green, next to a picture of his smiling face and a green checkmark. … “Republicans are convinced that the whole primary is Democrats trying to mess with them. They note, among other things, Ron M. Estes’ wife, Ellen Estes, had donated to Democrat James Thompson’s campaign when he was running against Estes in a special election last year and again late last year.” THE FULL GRASSLEY — Because it is never too early to campaign in Iowa, 2020 presidential candidate Rep. John Delaney is making his 14th stop in the state this week. His camp said he’s slated to complete the “full Grassley ” on Sunday — visiting all 99 of Iowa’s counties. BATTLEGROUND WATCH — The NRCC added Peter Tedeschi, who is running in Massachusetts’ 9th District, to its “Contenders” phase of its Young Guns program — the second tier of its battleground race list. REMEMBERING PAUL LAXALT — The former Nevada governor and senator died Monday at 96. The Las Vegas Review-Journal’s Steve Tetreault’s obituary. CODA — QUOTE OF THE DAY: “I can run faster and jump higher than the other candidates,” Wisconsin Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mahlon Mitchell joking about the advantage he has over his primary opponents because he is a black candidate, to HuffPost.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,Succulents That Stun in the Snow: Start Planning Now,"Debra Lee Baldwin, author of ‘Designing with Succulents,’ on new cold-hardy varieties that add brilliant color and exotic shapes to your winter garden—just when you need them most.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/succulents-that-stun-in-the-snow-start-planning-now-1520613870,2018-03-09T16:44:31Z,"IF YOU GARDEN in a climate that endures real winters, all that succulent-loaded landscaping in sunny states might turn you chlorophyll green with envy. Those chubby leaves and architectural forms, not to mention a rainbow of colors, elude northern gardeners. The booming succulents industry has registered your pain. In response to demand, growers are cultivating tough, showy varieties that sail through subzero winters. These newcomers not only save Northerners the trouble of hauling them inside when temperatures drop, they add a new type of evergreen to your winter garden, and a snowstorm only makes them more sculptural. “Most cold-hardy succulents change color through the seasons when grown outdoors,” said Matts Jopson of northern California’s Mountain Crest Gardens, a large online hardy-succulent retailer that’s seen sales increase 10-fold in five years. For example, the plants pictured at left (“Seeing Red”) take on cranberry hues in winter. In summer, or in the greenhouse, these hens-and-chicks rosettes are Granny Smith green with reddish tips, while the sedum’s scalloped leaves are pale green with purple edges, the plants loaded with clusters of starry yellow flowers. At Mr. Jopson’s nursery, he said, the cold-hardy varieties actually “look best after a snowy winter.” Early last spring, when sun melted 18 inches of snow, which had hid the plants for six weeks, “the colors were the most spectacular we’d seen—vivid rich shades of red, purple, pink, and even a few oranges, blues, and golds.” “There are hundreds of kinds of sedum,” said Panayoti Kelaidis, senior curator of the Denver Botanic Gardens. He noted that these tiny-leaved ground covers (commonly known as stonecrops) spread by rooting from little pieces “even in Zone 3,” where average lows are between -35 and -30 degrees. He’s equally enthusiastic about hylotelephiums. After these shrub perennials’ broccoli-shaped flowers go to seed and flurries arrive, they resemble snow cones, as seen in New York’s High Line. Though these varieties pay off in cold weather, spring is when growers’ selections expand, and you need to get them in the ground well before the freeze returns, as well as do some advance planning, especially when it comes to ensuring good drainage. “Wetness is the enemy,” cautioned Mr. Kelaidis. “Plant them in walls, rock gardens and shallow containers.” Give in-ground plants maximum sun exposure and “a microclimate similar to a Russian steppe.” That is, a south-facing slope amended with coarse, gritty soil.

53,California issues 1st licenses for its legal pot market,California issued its first batch of business licenses for the state's upcoming legal marijuana market sets the stage for sales to begin in January.,https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/legal-pot/california-issues-first-licenses-its-legal-pot-market-n829936,2017-12-15T04:57:00Z,"LOS ANGELES — California on Thursday issued its first batch of business licenses for the state's upcoming legal marijuana market, setting the stage for sales to begin in January. The first temporary license was awarded to Pure CA, which does business as Moxie brand products, a company known for its cannabis extracts. ""I couldn't be more excited,"" said Moxie CEO Jordan Lams, who credited ""a lot of the stars aligning"" for being awarded the first distributor license for recreational pot. Marijuana plants are displayed at the Green Goat Family Farms stand at ""The State of Cannabis,"" a California industry group meeting in Long Beach, California on Thursday, Sept. 28, 2017. Damian Dovarganes / AP file ""California has been without regulations for a very long time. So there is going to be a transition period,"" he added, referring to the changes coming in 2018 with legal cultivation and sales. The release of the initial 20 temporary licenses, good for 120 days, represents another steppingstone toward legal purchases, which were approved by voters last year. ""We plan to issue many more before Jan. 1,"" Lori Ajax, the state's top marijuana regulator, said in a statement. Related: California has approved legal pot, but black market growers thrive The first license for recreational retail sales went to Torrey Holistics in San Diego, which submitted a 60-page lease, diagrams and a detailed business plan. Tony Hall, who opened the shop two years ago with a college friend, said he sees recreational marijuana taking off like the wine and craft beer industries. Customers go through an electronic security gate manned by a guard. Once inside, the business looks like a stylish pharmacy with wood floors and Christmas decorations. ""The taboo part is slowly going to be removed and this is going to be like any other business,"" Hall said. In general, California will treat cannabis like alcohol, allowing people 21 and older to legally possess up to an ounce and grow six marijuana plants at home. Come January, the newly legalized recreational sales will be merged with the state's two-decade-old medical marijuana market, which is also coming under much stronger regulation. Related: Will Las Vegas Be ‘Amsterdam on Steroids’? Door Opens for Pot Lounges The state and local governments have been rushing to develop rules for the new industry. A patchwork is emerging with some cities embracing legal sales and others banning commercial pot activity. In the background is widespread uncertainty about whether President Donald Trump's administration will attempt to intervene in states where marijuana is legal. As marijuana is illegal in the eyes of the federal government, major banks are leery to do business with dispensaries and growers so much of the business is conducted in cash.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54,"In the Instagram Age, White Christmas Trees Rule","As the fake Christmas tree loses its stigma, shoppers are embracing the artificial and going all out with photogenic white ones.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-the-instagram-age-white-christmas-trees-rule-1513782565,2017-12-20T15:09:33Z,"White Christmas trees are white hot this year. “What could be more faux than having a snow-covered tree in your living room?” says Carrie Chen, brand manager for Treetopia, an online Christmas tree retailer whose sales of white trees are up 44.5% this year. White trees—whether flocked with fake snow or shimmering stark white—can appear lit in daytime and are photogenic, particularly in white-on-white looks in home-décor magazines and on Instagram. “If you’re going to have a tree that isn’t real, it feels like you’re owning it,” says Clea Shearer, co-owner of the Home Edit, a home-organization company based in Nashville, Tenn. Ms. Shearer put up a stark-white 7-foot tree near her foyer at home. She paid $93 for it on Amazon and enlisted her children, Stella, 6, and Sutton, 3, to help decorate it in shatterproof Christmas balls, with pinks and reds near the top and purples toward the bottom. The tree adds a pop of color to a black-and-white room. Fake has become a new badge of authenticity. More people find that trying to appear all-natural all the time is exhausting. Women delight in telling one another that their eyelashes are fake. Sally Swift, a 56-year-old radio producer in Silver Spring, Md., says she took a break this year from chopping down and hauling home a fresh Christmas tree. Instead, she put up a plastic one trimmed in white lights and blue paper ornaments from Party City. Total cost: $130. “There is so much freedom for me in this,” she says. The tree, she says, “is so ugly, it’s kind of beautiful. People’s jaws drop when they see it. They laugh and say, ‘That’s really great.’ It’s a great conversation.” White trees have taken off on social media. “For so long, there have been these decorative expectations when it comes to what a Christmas tree should look like,” says Julie Cassetina, spokeswoman for online home-décor retailer Wayfair. “Today, everyone is pushing the envelope and thinking about how they can capture a moment through the lens of their smartphone. That plays a huge role when it comes to decorating for the holidays.” Wayfair says sales of white trees from October to Dec. 10 quadrupled compared with the year-earlier period, with many models selling out earlier than expected. This year, white trees make up 13% of total Christmas tree sales, up from 5% last year. “That’s crazy high,” says Adam Skomurski, Wayfair’s seasonal category manager. The company increased the number of models offered by 71% to 120 this year, as buyers spotted white trees at trade shows and images of dream-house living rooms with white Christmas trees on social media. “When we put that together, we were confident sales would trend upward in 2017,” Mr. Skomurski says. “But this surpassed our expectation.” Home Depot has seen a 50% increase in sales of white trees in stores and online. This year, it added a Lexington artificial tree with “warm white lights and pine cones” to its mix of white trees. The Lexington sells for $249 to $299, depending on size. Five out of 40 artificial trees displayed in Home Depot stores are white, up from just two last year. “That’s actually a lot,” says Kelie Charles, holiday merchant at the retailer. “I was concerned about having that many on the floor.” Artificial Christmas trees are a $1.2 billion business, with sales increasing about 3% each year, says Thomas Harman, president of the American Christmas Tree Association, a trade group that represents artificial and real Christmas tree suppliers. This year, he expects sales to rise by 3% to 5%, thanks in part to reports of shortages of real trees. The National Christmas Tree Association, which represents growers of fresh trees, says sales for the $2 billion-a-year business have been relatively flat in recent years. Marsha Gray, spokeswoman for the association, estimates prices are up 2% to 3% from last year. “The shortage of trees and an increase in prices may tip people over the edge into buying that artificial Christmas tree they’ve been thinking about buying for the past few Christmases,” says Mr. Harman, who is founder of Balsam Hill, a Redwood City, Calif., maker of artificial Christmas trees. Consumers figure: Why not do something different? In some ways, a white tree is a better canvas than a green one, says Mr. Harman, whose sales of white trees doubled this year as sales of other trees increased 6% to 8%. That influence, he thinks, is coming from designers, blogs and stage sets and trickling down to consumers. “Here’s the thing: A green tree is actually difficult to decorate because so many things blend into green,” he says. Consumers find that out when they buy red and green ornaments. “It turns out that green ornaments often don’t look really great on a green tree.” A white tree makes colors stand out more. Natosha Tullos, a nurse in Salt Lake City, switched this year from a real tree to a $159 white-frosted model from Walmart. “For whatever reason, I am into the whole White Christmas thing this year,” says the 45-year-old mother of four, ages 17 to 23. Her living room furniture and throw pillows are white or shades of taupe and gray, so the tree fits in well, she says. “I wanted a whiter feel to my Christmas décor.” She used glass, silver and white ornaments and large blush-colored balls to echo her home’s bright pink front door. “I love the idea of bringing snow into my living room,” she says.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,Provinces and pot: Whose approach is best?,Alberta and Quebec recently unveiled their strategies for the commercialization of legal marijuana,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/provinces-and-pot-whose-approach-is-best/article37032439/,2017-11-20T21:58:13Z,"The socialist NDP is embracing the free market, while the free-market Liberals seem to prefer the old-style state monopoly. That is just one of the quirky realities as the provinces and territories slowly and unsurely unveil their strategies for the commercialization of legal marijuana. Currently, only ""medical"" cannabis is legal. It must be prescribed and purchased from one of 74 licensed producers. More than 200,000 Canadians have availed themselves of this privilege. Story continues below advertisement But changes to the federal Criminal Code and the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act mean that, come July 1, 2018, any adult can possess small amounts of marijuana. While the Cannabis Act lays out the legal framework, the federal government left it to the provinces to figure out how marijuana will be sold. In the past week, Quebec and Alberta both introduced legislation, and they took sharply different approaches. Ontario and New Brunswick are the only other provinces to have introduced legislation to date. Quebec's Bill 157, introduced by the pro-business Liberal government, creates a new government agency, the Société québécoise du cannabis, which will have a monopoly on the sale of recreational cannabis, both in retail outlets and online. This is almost identical to neighbouring Ontario's approach. However, Quebec will have only 15 stores come July 1, and 150 within two years. That seems shockingly inadequate given that there are 801 state-run Société des alcools du Québec outlets selling liquor in the province, not to mention beer and wine in every corner store. Quebec is also banning grow-your-own pot, although federal law allows up to four plants to be harvested for personal use. Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement Under the new law, marijuana can be smoked anywhere it is legal to smoke cigarettes, with one exception – college and university campuses. This seems like an odd rule; if anything, educational institutions and their grounds should be smoke-free. On the retail front, Alberta's New Democrats have taken a diametrically opposed approach to Quebec. Under Bill 26, cannabis will be sold in private retail outlets, with no limit on the number of stores. The Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission will license businesses and handle distribution, just as it does with liquor stores. (In 1993, Alberta shut down 200 state-run liquor stores; it now has more than 2,000 private liquor stores.) However, Alberta will not allow cannabis to be sold where liquor, cigarettes or pharmaceuticals are sold, which means stand-alone dispensaries, which provinces such as Ontario are vowing to shut down. Interestingly, Alberta has kept one element of cannabis sales out of private hands: online sales. In fact, only Manitoba has indicated that it will allow private retailers to sell marijuana by mail – even though almost all medical marijuana is currently purchased from licensed growers and distributed via Canada Post. Story continues below advertisement Online sales, which have received little attention compared with bricks-and-mortar sales outlets, could prove especially lucrative for the provinces. But that depends on whether the online prices for cannabis are the same as in-store prices. To date, no province has issued any regulations about price, although legal cannabis will likely sell from $7 to $10 a gram, plus taxes. With close to $1-billion in taxes alone to be had in the first year of the legal green rush, there is obviously much jockeying going on here. Provinces want more than a 50-50 share of the proposed $1-a-gram excise tax, and users of ""medical"" marijuana want a tax exemption. In Alberta, pot can be smoked anywhere cigarettes are smoked, with one exception – no toking in motor vehicles, even for passengers. Alberta will allow adults to grow their own marijuana, to a maximum of four plants, but they must be grown indoors. Ontario has also adopted the no-outdoor-gardening rule. To date, all provinces have limited sales to 30 grams at a time (about a small baggie's worth) but with no limit on how much cannabis one can keep for personal use in the home. Quebec, however, says a personal stash must not exceed 150 grams. Clearly, with the July 1 deadline approaching, all provinces need to make their plans clear, and soon. All eyes are now on British Columbia, the land of bud. Will the newly elected NDP government legalize the province's extensive network of dispensaries, take the state-run-store route or try some hybrid approach?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56,138 things Trump did this year while you weren't looking,"Behind the crazy headlines, more conservative priorities got pushed through than most people realize. An exhaustive list of what really happened to the government in 2017.",https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/12/29/138-trump-policy-changes-2017-000603,2017-12-29T10:14:40Z,"In Donald Trump’s first act as president, he signed a high-profile executive order intended to dismantle Obamacare, instructing federal agencies to take any measures they could to roll back the Affordable Care Act. In retrospect, the vaguely worded directive was only symbolic. The Trump administration did eventually make moves to obstruct the law, but they took months and another executive order to implement. For all the theater, it’s hard to say whether that order had any effect at all. Less noticed on Inauguration Day was a surprise move by the Federal Housing Administration to scratch a planned reduction in mortgage insurance premiums. That change helped shore up the financial health of the FHA’s mortgage insurance fund—but came at a real cost to homeowners, who would have saved an average of $500 a year if the Obama-era plan had stayed in place. If you didn’t hear about the $500 you may have lost that day—well, that’s how the year went. The attention gap between the empty executive order and the real-life mortgage insurance rollback turned out to be representative of the whole first year of the Trump administration. Again and again, Trump has taken the stage to an adoring crowd and declared victory on some issue, or announced lavish new promises, without any real results or plans to back them up. Meanwhile, very steadily, and almost totally separately from Trump’s speeches and tweetstorms, his administration has been ushering in a new conservative era of government—taking specific aim at Obama-era rules, and broader aim at the big regulatory mission of government. At The Agenda, we’ve been tracking these policy changes weekly since June, ignoring the noise and explaining what the Trump administration actually accomplished each week. This week, we’re pulling them all into one mega-list—a portrait of a quiet but very serious Republican push against the scope and ambition of government. What does it look like? There are a few consistent themes: Rolling back Obama’s legacy on everything from labor regulations to environmental protections, and more broadly tearing down rules across the government. Some topics have been largely missing: his infrastructure push has gone nowhere. Many of the rules are still in progress, or being delayed so long that it’s anyone’s guess what will really happen. (As you’ll see, some of our items are recurring episodes in long-running dramas, like what will finally happen to Obama’s fiduciary standard, which required stockbrokers to act in the best interest of their clients.) And finally, there are some perplexing surprises. After all the rhetoric against China and Mexico, the year’s big trade-war enemy has been… Canada ? Welcome to the annual wrap-up of our weekly guide to what Trump did while you weren’t looking. June 3-9 1. A boost for Uber and McDonald’s. It’s the most controversial question in the labor world these days: When is a worker an employee, and when is he or she an independent contractor? That question has been especially controversial for “gig economy” companies like Uber and Postmates. But increasingly, regular businesses are also opting to classify their workers as independent contractors, which can cut their labor costs sharply by not obliging them to offer benefits like health insurance or pay employer payroll taxes. According to one recent study, the percentage of workers employed as contractors grew almost 30 percent from 2005 to 2015. In 2015, the Obama administration gave workers a win on this one: It issued a guidance document explaining how the Department of Labor would interpret the law, outlining the economic tests it employed in determining whether an employer was misclassifying its workers. The agency had been using that policy in enforcing the law, but putting it in writing sent a clear message to employers across the country that the Obama administration was serious about cracking down on worker misclassification. On Wednesday, the Trump administration withdrew the guidance document. This was a win for business owners in any number of sectors — not just Uber, but industries such as farming and construction, which increasingly use independent contractors. The withdrawal of the document doesn’t change the underlying law, the Fair Labor Standards Act, or the DOL’s current interpretation of it but sends a strong signal to employers that Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta plans to interpret it differently than his predecessor. “The big story is not that, for whatever reason, they pulled down guidance,” said David Weil, who issued the document under Obama. “The real question is what else comes with this.” Acosta also withdrew another Obama-era guidance document on how the department will determine whether a parent company, like McDonald’s or Subway, is jointly responsible for its franchises’ labor violations. As with worker misclassification, the Obama-era DOL interpreted the joint employment standard favorably for workers; its withdrawal is a victory for businesses. 2. A trade war with Mexico averted — for now. Trump has stormed on about the North American Free Trade Agreement, calling it a “trading disaster” and vowing to rip it up, suggesting that a trade war with Mexico may be on the horizon. But on Tuesday, the United States and Mexico went the other direction and actually came to a deal, averting a potential trade crisis when they ended a dispute on Mexican sugar exports. The showdown was seen as a first test for the two countries as they, along with Canada, seek to preserve and update NAFTA later this year. The sugar deal is a quintessentially in-the-weeds trade agreement: It raises the minimum prices for raw and refined sugar and cuts the percentage of Mexico’s sugar exports that are refined from 53 percent to 30 percent, while redefining the purity level for refined sugar. The U.S. sugar industry objected to the deal, arguing that it did not address loopholes that give Mexican producers an unfair advantage in the U.S. market. It wasn’t the win that industry wanted, but many experts were encouraged that the administration’s first big dispute with a major trading partner had an amicable ending. 3. The end of a DOJ “slush fund.” Three years ago, when the Department of Justice settled a $17 billion settlement with Bank of America over its mortgage lending practices, it came with a requirement: The bank had to pay $100 million to various legal and community groups, a sum intended to help homeowners hurt by Bank of America’s wrongdoing. Many other DOJ settlements with financial institutions during the Obama administration required similar payouts to outside groups. Conservatives have long objected to this practice, which was used by Obama and, before him, George W. Bush: They see it as a way for a president to direct money to his favored organizations, illegally sidestepping the congressional appropriations process. The Obama administration argued that so-called third-party settlements were simply another tool for reparations: The money, they said, didn’t go to random organizations but to groups that could help repair the damage caused by financial misdeeds. Opponents called it a “slush fund.” That ended Wednesday when Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo prohibiting U.S. attorneys from including such third-party payouts in any settlements. When the Department of Justice settles a case from now on, third-party groups won’t get a dime. 4. A win for nursing homes. Last October, the Obama administration banned any nursing home that receives federal funding — which is most of them — from requiring that prospective tenants sign an arbitration agreement as a condition to be admitted, a common practice in the industry. Such agreements prevent residents from taking the facility to court, requiring them to appeal to an arbitration tribunal. Nursing homes prefer arbitration because it’s usually cheaper than getting sued; critics say it’s unfair to residents, who often have no idea they signed away their right to sue in court until they actually try to file charges, at which point the nursing home shows them the fine print. The nursing home industry fought the rule, suing the Department of Health and Human Services. In November, it won a temporary injunction against the regulation, so it never actually took effect. And now it may be dead. On Tuesday, the Trump administration signaled its view on arbitration agreements: the Department of Health and Human Services issued a new proposed regulation that rolled back the Obama rule. Because it’s not final, the new rule doesn’t immediately overturn the ban on arbitration agreements; it has to go through the same process as any other rule. But it sends a strong signal for where the administration will ultimately land. 5. Get THAAD out of here. Not every major policy change affecting America originates in Washington. On Wednesday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in blocked the deployment of an American missile defense system intended to block missile attacks from North Korea. The Pentagon’s Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system became a hot-button issue in Asia: China sees the North Korea angle as a cover story for a system that’s really intended to block Chinese missiles, an incursion on its sovereignty. (The Pentagon disputes that argument.) It already was a delicate issue in South Korea; Beijing had been successfully using state media to persuade Chinese consumers to boycott South Korean stores and cancel vacation plans, which has hurt many Korean businesses. Then Trump rattled relations with its ally by insisting in April that South Korea foot the $1 billion bill for the system, an idea later walked back by his national security team. Moon, a left-leaning leader who supports a more open dialogue with North Korea than his scandal-plagued predecessor — was already reluctant to host THAAD at all, but allowed its continued deployment until he discovered last week, to his surprise, that the Pentagon had sent four more launchers into the country. On Wednesday, he stopped any further deployment of the system — just a day before North Korea conducted its 10th missile test of the year. June 10 – 16 1. U.S. and China make nice on beef, dairy and poultry Throughout his campaign, Trump railed against Chinese trade policies, vowing to label the country a currency manipulator and scaring the business community that a trade war was on the horizon. But Trump backed off his promise to officially label Beijing a “currency manipulator.” And in May, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced the U.S.-China 100-Day trade agreement, calling it a “herculean accomplishment.” Still, trade experts who looked at the details of the agreement, were less convinced. Many of the ten policy changes were already underway; on the new changes, China made few firm commitments. This week, a trio of trade announcements revealed there was more substance to the deal than originally thought, if not quite “herculean.” On Tuesday, the Department of Agriculture announced it had finalized an agreement with its Chinese counterparts to allow U.S. beef imports into China, breaking a 14-year ban that Beijing has more-than-once promised to end. On Thursday, the U.S. and China signed a memorandum to promote U.S dairy products in China and on Friday, the USDA published a proposed rule to allow Chinese poultry products into the U.S. These aren’t huge changes to the U.S.-China trade relationship, and some were in the works long before Trump took office. In fact, China promised last September to lift the ban on U.S. beef exports; the dairy agreement wasn’t actually part of the “100-Day” trade deal. But the trio of agreements show that even as Trump rails against Beijing’s trade policies, the two sides are still capable of compromising. For all the eye rolls that Trump’s initial “100-Day” deal invited, it’s looking a lot more real two months later, especially once beef shipments actually arrive in China, which Ross estimated could be as soon as 10 days. “Everyone has been justified in taking a wait and see attitude,” said Bruce Hirsh, a former assistant U.S. trade representative. “Even now, until actual shipments are accepted, it's best to wait and see.” 2. Education Department targets Obama-era student protections With student-loan debt a trillion-dollar issue, the Obama administration announced a new policy last October that would allow defrauded borrowers to have their federal student loans cancelled—an expensive proposition for the government, which would cover the cost. Student advocates, who had long pushed Obama to adopt such a rule, cheered the news, arguing it was simply a matter of fairness. One problem: The rule wasn’t scheduled to take effect until July 1—and now it looks like it will never take effect. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos announced this week that the agency was delaying the implementation of the so-called “defense to repayment” rule indefinitely, on the grounds that it is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit. In effect, this means the idea is almost certainly dead: DeVos also announced that the department intends to rewrite the rule altogether, along with another major Obama-era education rule, known as “gainful employment,” that required colleges to meet certain standards or risk losing access to federal student loan dollars. Unlike “defense to repayment,” the “gainful employment” rule was finalized in 2014 and had already taken effect, so the Trump administration will have to undertake a full rulemaking process to rewrite it, a time-consuming process. The changes are a defeat for defrauded students and a big victory for for-profit colleges, which are disproportionately represented among both loan-fraud cases and colleges that leave students with high debt levels. For-profits loudly argued that the Obama administration was effectively trying to choke out the industry altogether. This week, DeVos gave it new life. 3. The Pentagon flexes its muscles During the Obama administration, the military often complained that the White House was micromanaging its affairs, requiring high-level, interagency approval for decisions on troop levels or drone strikes outside of active warzones. Trump has dramatically reversed those policies, giving the Department of Defense wide autonomy to conduct overseas military operations. That autonomy was on display in two countries this week: Somalia and Afghanistan. On Sunday, the U.S. struck the Shabab, a terrorist group, in Southern Somalia, the DOD’s first known use of additional war-making powers in Somalia. In March, the Trump administration had declared parts of Somalia as an “area of active hostilities,” which gives military commanders the same authority to conduct raids and strikes as they now have in active warzones like Iraq; it also reduces protections for civilians. Human rights advocates criticized the move, saying it effectively allows the Pentagon to conduct unauthorized wars with little oversight. U.S. officials responded that it was necessary to confront emerging threats quickly. The U.S. Africa Command was slower than the White House expected in launching operations after the March change; Sunday’s strike appears to be the first under the new authority. This week, Trump also gave the Department of Defense the autonomy to decide whether more troops are needed in Afghanistan. Washington had been anticipating a decision from the White House on the proposed Afghan troop surge for weeks, with Defense Secretary James Mattis arguing in favor and White House officials like chief strategist Steve Bannon arguing against it. Trump’s decision to outsource the decision to the Pentagon is a big win for the agency and for Mattis—and an outcome that would have been unthinkable under Obama. 4. VA civil service reforms heads to Trump’s desk For years, Congress has tried to reform the rules for firing workers at the Department of Veterans Affairs, having grown frustrated at the difficulty of removing employees responsible for the scandal at VA hospitals in 2014, which eventually led to the resignation of Secretary Eric Shinseki. This week lawmakers sent a substantive set of reforms to the president’s desk; he is expected to sign them in the days ahead. The legislation, called the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, creates a new office to provide greater protection for whistleblowers and significantly shrinks the time needed to fire VA employees. Previously, it could take months, if not years, to broom out problem employees; agencies often deemed it not worth the effort to try. Under the bill, the review structure largely remains in place for rank-in-file employees—it changed more for senior executives—but it sharply cuts the time for filing appeals and for the oversight board to reach a decision. It also lowers the burden of proof necessary for agencies to take action against employees. Groups representing federal employees, including the American Federation for Government Employees and the Senior Executives Association, said the legislation would undermine worker protections like due process. Veterans’ groups cheered the changes. Civil-service reforms don’t often get much attention, but these are significant changes with bipartisan support, and government reformers are watching them closely. If they prove successful at the VA, lawmakers could soon look to implement them across government. 5. New food labels? Not so fast. Not every Trump rollback targets a Barack Obama policy—some of them target Michelle Obama policies. The former first lady made healthy living her top priority during her husband’s presidency, promoting exercise with her “Let’s Move” program and working to improve the nutrition of school lunches. One of her big policy wins was the redesign of the nutrition facts panel, the one that appears on all the packaged foods you buy. Unveiled by Obama in May 2016, the first redesign in more than two decades makes the calorie number more visible and includes information on “added sugars” for the first time, provoking a sharp response from the sugar industry. Food makers were supposed to start using the new labels by July 26, 2018—but on Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration put them on indefinite hold. There’s no timetable for when it could be implemented; industry groups had also been pushing to align the timing with another FDA rule on the disclosure of genetically-modified organisms, which isn’t expected until 2018. In a note explaining the delay, the FDA said the extra time was needed for manufacturers to print the new label. It said nothing about actually rethinking the redesign altogether, although it’s possible that could happen too. June 17 – 23 1. The Labor Department loosens a rule on beryllium exposure You haven’t heard of it since chemistry class, but beryllium is a chemical toxic to lung tissue. The Department of Labor took years to finalize a rule protecting workers from exposure, and didn’t issue the final version until the tail end of Obama’s presidency—January 9, to be exact. It was always at risk of removal by the Republican Congress, which could have repealed it with just a majority vote, but it survived until now. On Friday, the Department of Labor proposed a new rule on beryllium exposure; it doesn’t change the original exposure limits imposed by Obama but instead eliminates additional safety requirements for the construction and shipyard industries, such as conducting medical surveillance or providing training for those workers who are near, but not above, the exposure limits. Labor groups slammed the change, saying that it would lead to more lung disease and cancer among workers. Industry groups applauded the changes; the original rule, they argued, was too restrictive. The DOL must still go through a full rule-making process, so the new beryllium rule won’t be finalized for months. In the meantime, the department said it wouldn’t be enforcing the Obama-era rule. 2. A new emergency alert for cops We’ve all noticed the emergency warnings on television or radio, which alert audiences about a child abduction (the “Amber Alert”) or severe weather. Soon, there may be a new alert: a “Blue Alert” for when a police officer is missing, seriously injured or killed in the line of duty. On Thursday, the Federal Communications Commission unanimously approved the first stage of rulemaking to add such a “Blue Alert” to the FCC’s Emergency Alert System (EAS), which was created in 1997 to enable the president to communicate quickly and directly with the American people in the case of an emergency. Stations are required to carry such presidential alerts but alerts for a child abduction or severe weather are voluntary. A “Blue Alert” has already been implemented in 27 states; the FCC proposal would make it a national standard. The change has bipartisan support—it’s hard to see politicians taking a stance against showing concern for officer safety—but it also fits with the Trump administration’s focus on attacks on cops, and the Department of Justice’s pivot from Obama-era policies on police accountability toward a more protective stance on police. 3. The Yucca nuclear controversy re-opens So … where is America supposed to put its spent nuclear fuel over the long term? A decades-old debate was reawakened this week when Rick Perry, the energy secretary, announced at a congressional hearing on Tuesday that he was reconstituting the Office of Civilian Radioactive Management, which ran a proposed Nevada site for long-term waste storage. Throughout the Obama administration, with Nevada Sen. Harry Reid leading the Senate Democrats, plans to store nuclear waste in Nevada’s Yucca Mountain had no chance of actually happening. Now it’s back. This wasn’t exactly a surprise, since Trump’s budget included $120 million to restart the licensing process for the Yucca site; in fact, in May, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission took the first steps towards restarting that process. But Perry’s words nevertheless created a sharp backlash from Nevada politicians who have long fought any plan to store nuclear waste in their state. Perry somewhat walked back his comments at a separate congressional hearing on Wednesday, saying that “no decision has been made at this time with respect to the timing or the location, for that matter, of waste storage."" But the Office of Civilian Radioactive Management is still set to reopen during fiscal 2018. The next Yucca fight is just beginning. 4. The White House gets tough with Russia Amid multiple congressional inquiries and the investigation by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, the Trump administration hasn’t done much to distance itself from Moscow. So it may have come as a surprise on Tuesday when the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on more than three dozen individuals and organizations involved in Russia’s annexation of Crimea. The announcement coincided with Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko’s visit to the White House, but many observers wondered if the administration had a different motive: discouraging the House from taking up the Senate’s Russian sanctions bill. That legislation, which passed the Senate last week by a 98-2 vote, would limit Trump’s ability to ease sanctions on the Russian government. The White House has been working to water down or kill the Senate bill. The new sanctions can’t hurt those efforts. 5. Trump quietly releases another immigration executive order It went almost entirely unnoticed: At 9:20 p.m. on Wednesday, the White House released a new executive order on immigration. Compared to Trump’s past orders on immigration, which have set off national protests and ongoing court cases, this one was minor. It makes a very small change to an Obama-era executive order, removing one section that directed the secretaries of state and homeland security to create a plan so that “80 percent of nonimmigrant visa applicants are interviewed within 3 weeks of receipt of application.” So now, DHS and State can take more time to review nonimmigrant visa applicants. What’s the reasoning for this? Michael Short, a White House spokesperson, said in an email that the change was “a very straightforward step that removes an arbitrary requirement and ensures the State Department has the needed discretion to make real world security determinations.” He explained that the White House didn’t want to set an “arbitrary deadline” for reviewing and vetting visa applicants. For people seeking nonimmigrant visas, which include everything from business travelers to foreign athletes to diplomats, this could mean longer waits as their applications are processed. But to the White House, any additional waits are simply a necessary step to keep the country safe. June 24 – 30 1. The Labor Department was busy, Part 1 The Department of Labor issued some big regulations under Obama, and Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta isn’t wasting any time targeting those. Just this week, he took aim at three big ones: the overtime rule, the fiduciary standard and an electronic recordkeeping rule. Under Obama, the department said it would require certain large employers to electronically submit data on injuries and illnesses, starting July 1. But on Tuesday, the Department of Labor officially proposed delaying the record-keeping rule to December 1. The rule isn’t final yet, so it will technically take effect Saturday but the Department previously said it won’t yet accept electronic submissions. Supporters of the rule hope that sunshine will act as a disinfectant, shaming companies into better labor practices; companies say it is onerous and unnecessary. Then on Thursday, the Department asked for comments about delaying the January 1, 2018 compliance date of another major Obama rule—the “fiduciary standard,” which requires financial advisers selling investment products to act in the best interest of their clients. In May, Acosta announced in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that he was going to allow the fiduciary rule to take effect as planned on June 9, prompting cheers from Democrats who thought the rule was doomed. Those cheers may have been premature: The department had previously announced that it wouldn’t actually enforce the rule until January 1—and Thursday’s news is a sign that Acosta is considering more substantive reforms. Finally, this week the agency sent some signals against Obama’s overtime rule, which doubled the salary threshold under which almost all employees are entitled to time-and-half pay for working overtime. What actually happened was technical: the department defended its authority to set a salary threshold in determining whether an employee qualifies for overtime, filing a brief in federal court in a case challenging the rule. However, what didn’t happen was crucial: The agency didn’t defend the overtime rule itself. In fact, it gave a very strong indication this week that it doesn’t support the rule: On Tuesday, the Department sent a request for comments about the overtime rule to the White House for review, the first step towards significantly reforming the rule. 2. The Labor Department was busy, Part 2 The Department of Labor has two big policy tools at its disposal: rule-making and enforcement. Rules get most of the attention, but enforcement can have a larger impact on worker’s daily lives—and under Obama, the DOL used its enforcement powers broadly, earning praise from labor groups and criticism from businesses. On Tuesday, the Labor Department gave a big hint that a new enforcement regime is beginning. The DOL’s Wage and Hour division announced that it would resume issuing opinion letters, which are documents requested by an employer or employee that provide case-by-case legal guidance over potential federal labor law violations. Businesses like opinion letters: They give individual companies a clear idea if their labor practices are likely to violate the law. Many labor groups don’t: Critics say they suck up department resources that could be spent on investigations, and unfairly favor big employers, who have the resources and know-how to submit formal queries to the government, over employees, who don’t. Under Bush, the Labor Department issued lots of opinion letters. but Obama discontinued the practice, instead issuing general guidance documents that explain broadly how the DOL interprets the law. Acosta rescinded those guidance documents three weeks ago. The resumption of opinion letters doesn’t signal a policy change in itself. But the shift is telling: Under the Acosta regime, business is finding the door open again. 3. Trump expands his trade fight with Canada During his presidential campaign, Trump slammed China for its currency practices and sharply criticized Mexico over its cheap labor. But Canada largely avoided the crossfire—until Trump took office. Since then, our Northern neighbor has become the chief target of Trump’s trade ire as the Commerce Department imposed preliminary tariffs of 7.7 percent on certain Canadian lumber companies. This is the second time Trump has imposed penalties on the Canadian lumber industry; in April, Commerce announced tariffs of 24 percent on certain Canadian lumber companies. It’s the latest moves in the long-simmering dispute that has turned hot in the last few months. The lumber fight is the background battle as the two sides, along with Mexico, are preparing to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. This week, the U.S. Trade Representative hosted a three-day public hearing on NAFTA with 140 witnesses giving five minute statements and then answering questions from government officials. All involved appear to agree that the renegotiation will be long and hard—and the escalating fight over Canadian lumber won’t engender any good will. 4. EPA targets a top Obama-era rule In May, 2015, the Obama administration issued the Waters of the United States rule—colloquially known as WOTUS—a far-reaching and long-awaited plan to limit pollution in America’s wetlands. The culmination of years of work, WOTUS was hailed by environmentalists as a marquee moment in America’s commitment to cleaning up its polluted waters. But two years later, WOTUS is on the verge of defeat. Twenty seven states sued the Obama administration over the rule, arguing that the EPA exceeded its authority to regulate small streams and tributaries. A judge blocked the rule last year, so it hasn’t taken effect, and on Tuesday, the EPA, along with the Army Corps of Engineers, took the first step towards killing it, issuing a 52-page proposed rule to repeal WOTUS. The agencies are accepting comments for 30 days. Soon after, they will issue a final rule. 5. Trump tightens the grip on China—and North Korea When Trump took office, he quickly realized the threat posed by North Korea, even saying he was willing to go easier on trade if China helped Washington with Pyongyang. Those days appear to be waning. On Thursday, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on a small Chinese bank, saying that it “acts as a conduit for illicit North Korean financial activity,” along with two individuals and another Chinese company. The moves are the clearest sign that the Trump administration has decided that Beijing is unlikely to pressure North Korea into giving up its nuclear program and that unilateral action is necessary. Apparently, Trump meant what he tweeted last week: “While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi &amp; China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried!” July 1 – 7 1. A new era for the renewable fuel standard The Renewable Fuel Standard is one of the biggest annual fights in energy policy, a bruising battle between oil and agriculture interests. Under Obama, the agriculture industry frequently came out ahead as the Environmental Protection Agency upped the volume of biofuels — mostly corn-based ethanol — that oil refiners are required to mix into their gasoline supply. Those days may be over. On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency, under new Administrator Scott Pruitt, released its proposed Renewable Fuel Standard for 2018, which would leave the requirement for conventional biofuels unchanged at its 2017 level. But the EPA would reduce the requirement for advanced biofuels, the first reduction in volumes under the Renewable Fuel Standard. It’s a victory for oil and gas interests who praised the move but said it still did not go far enough. Biofuel producers slammed it. Pruitt also signaled that he could undertake broader reforms to the Renewable Fuel Standard, saying the EPA will conduct a technical analysis to “inform a future rule” about the program and will be “assessing higher levels of ethanol-free gasolin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
.” A new regulatory regime is well underway. 2. More oil and gas drilling on federal lands Under Obama, oil and gas companies frequently criticized the administration for limiting drilling on federal lands, an effort that was praised by environmentalists as a way to keep oil and gas in the ground and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. On Thursday, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke took a step in the exact opposite direction when he issued a secretarial order directing the Bureau of Land Management to speed up the permitting process for oil and gas leases. Zinke wants the BLM to hold quarterly lease sales and to issue permits within 30 days. The bureaucratic move is a first step toward opening up more federal land to oil and gas drilling but, as Zinke said, nothing will change overnight. With oil prices depressed, many producers aren’t interested in drilling on federal land. The order won’t change those market forces. 3. Another big victory for for-profit colleges A few weeks ago, the Department of Education targeted an Obama-era protection for students known as the “gainful employment” rule, which required colleges to meet certain standards or risk losing access to federal student loans. It was a big victory for for-profit colleges, which are disproportionately affected by the rule. But since the “gainful employment” rule was finalized in 2014, the department would have to undertake a full rule-making process to rewrite it. As of July 1, the rule required schools to disclose a range of information to prospective students, including completion rates and post-graduate earnings. But on Wednesday, the Department of Education issued a notice that it was extending the compliance date for those disclosures by a year, to July 1, 2018. In the meantime, schools must still disclose that information on their websites. The move is another victory for for-profit schools, which have found a much more welcome regulatory regime under new Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. 4. Trump takes another shot at Obama’s climate policy Just a couple weeks after Trump won the presidential election, Obama took a major step to secure his climate legacy when he blocked any oil or gas drilling in most of the Arctic waters. The plan, released by the Interior Department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, guides offshore energy development from 2017 to 2022, and was a major victory for environmentalists, obstructing Trump’s pledge to expand offshore drilling. On Monday, the Interior Department took the first step toward revising that five-year roadmap and opening the Arctic’s Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea and Cook Inlet areas to oil and gas drilling. The BOEM issued a notice in the Federal Register seeking comments from the public on a replacement plan that would cover 2019 to 2024. Oil and gas groups praised the move as a necessary step to secure America’s energy future, but critics said it would undermine U.S. efforts to fight climate change and put the Arctic waters at risk. Either way, changes won’t happen overnight: Zinke expects the rewrite to take two to three years. In the meantime, offshore drilling in most of the Arctic will remain off limits. Trump cannot overturn Obama’s climate legacy that easily. 5. The Pentagon delays lifting the ban on transgender troops In June 2016, the Obama administration announced that it would allow transgender troops to serve openly in the military, a move lauded by gay-rights groups and criticized by many Republicans who worried it could undermine the strength and stability of U.S. armed forces. The move was set to take effect on July 1 — but late last Friday, the Department of Defense announced that it was delaying lifting the ban until January 1," 2018 to determine the impact on """"the readiness and lethality of our forces."""" Some military experts are concerned that allowing transgender troops to serve openly would undermine unit cohesion and reduce the military's effectiveness. Gay-rights advocates vigorously dispute that argument and slammed the Pentagons delay. But they are hopeful that it signals a broader reversal of the Obama-era policy. July 8 – 14 1. Foreign entrepreneurs not welcome Trump’s overhaul of U.S. immigration policy hit a new target this week: foreign-born entrepreneurs. In 2016", President Barack Obama passed a rule to allow foreign-born entrepreneurs to remain in the U.S. while they build new companies. The so-called startup visa was a linchpin in Obama’s effort to encourage innovative foreigners to remain the U.S. as long as they were creating jobs for Americans; it was a top priority for many technology companies and venture capitalists. It was supposed to go into effect on July 17. This week, the Department of Homeland Security pushed it back, delaying the effective date until March, 2018. The agency also said it will propose another regulation to repeal the original rule, which relies on the government’s parole authority to allow foreigners to temporarily stay in the United States even if they don’t meet the requirements for a visa. This all has its roots in Trump’s executive order on immigration, signed in January, that directed the government to limit its use of parole to only a case-by-case basis. That provision didn’t make headlines, but many immigration experts saw it as a signal that Trump was planning to kill the startup visa—and this week’s move confirms that that is the case. 2. A Korean trade war brewing? Trump’s favorite targets on target on trade are well-known: China, Mexico and Germany. But there’s another country—an important U.S. ally—that often is a frequent target of Trump’s ire: South Korea. This week, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer took the first formal step to combatting Korea’s perceived trade infractions when he formally requested the two sides enter into discussions to consider changes to the five-year-old U.S.-South Korea trade agreement, which was signed under George W. Bush and approved by Congress in 2011. In a one-page letter to his Korean counterpart, Lighthizer specifically wrote that the Trump administration was determined to reverse the U.S.’s $28 billion bilateral trade deficit, a top goal for Trump, who brought up Korea’s trade policies as recently as Thursday in an interview with reporters on the plane ride to Paris. The stakes are high: Both the U.S. and South Korea are seeking a strategy to block North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, a difficult issue that has already created some tension between the longtime allies. Any trade disputes would only hurt the U.S.-Korea relationship. 3. A milestone for Obamacare As the Republican healthcare reform stands on a knife’s edge on Capitol Hill, states can’t just wait and see how those efforts end up; they need to take immediate steps to stabilize their health insurance markets—and they have a powerful tool to do so. A so-called Section 1332 innovation waiver, for its section of the Affordable Care Act, allows states to opt out of many Obamacare regulations within the basic parameters of the law. This week, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved its first waiver, to Alaska, which wants to set up a reinsurance program to help insurers that end up with a disproportionate number of high-cost enrollees. The program is intended to moderate premium increases and prevent its individual insurance market from collapsing. CMS will provide $323 million from 2018 to 2022, and estimates that Alaska’s plan will reduce premiums by 20 percent in 2018. The agency had previously signaled support for the waiver, so Tuesday’s announcement wasn’t a surprise. But it still marked a milestone for the law. The ACA puts strict rules around when and how states can waive Obamacare requirements but that could change if Senate Republicans reach a compromise on their health reform: Under their bill, states could receive approval for waivers much easily—with less oversight, and more freedom to spend money as they see fit. 4. The rollback of Obama’s environmental legacy continues While the Clean Power Plan and the Paris deal garnered most of the headlines, Obama’s environmental legacy touched all corners of the government, from offshore drilling leases to energy efficiency policies. But under Trump, a new environmental regime is underway, quickly reversing those policies. This week brought two such efforts. First, on Tuesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced that it was accepting comments on its proposal to rescind a ban on mining in Alaska’s Pebble Mine. Under Obama, the EPA refused to issue permits for gold and copper mining in Pebble and instead officially restricted mining in the area. The decision was the subject of a fierce legal battle, with developers arguing that the EPA’s determination violated the law and environmentalists arguing that pollution from the mining would threaten a nearby wild salmon fishery, the world’s largest. In May, the EPA, under Administrator Scott Pruitt, announced a deal with the owner of the Pebble Mine to withdraw an ongoing lawsuit, repeal the mining restrictions and allow Pebble a fair process to apply for a permit. Tuesday’s move is the first step in implementing that agreement and allowing drilling in Pebble. On Thursday, the Interior Department announced its first oil and gas lease sale since Trump took office, offering 75.9 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico—more than the agency offered in the Gulf of Mexico during all of 2016, in part due to a lack of demand. Secretary Ryan Zinke also announced that he was lowering royalty rates—the government’s share of the take—on shallow-water leases, an effort to encourage oil companies to drill despite the fact that oil prices remain depressed. The lease sale is scheduled for August 16. 5. A move to lower drug prices As prescription drug prices have climbed higher and higher, Americans have become angrier and angrier at drug companies and the government’s inability to rein in the price hikes. Trump has said the issue is a top priority for his administration, but he has made few real policy changes on it so far. That changed on Thursday when the Department of Health and Human Services released two major new rules setting 2018 payment rates and policies for hospital outpatient departments and ambulatory surgical centers. If it sounds complicated, that’s because it is: The proposed rules run almost 1,500 pages in total. But experts immediately focused on a reform to the prices that the government will pay certain doctors and hospitals for prescription drugs. The change relates to the 340B discount drug program, which was created in 1992 and requires drug manufacturers to offer outpatient drugs at a heavy discount—around 22.5 percent on average—to hospitals and doctors that serve a large share of low-income patients. Under last year’s payment schedule, CMS reimbursed hospitals for 340B drugs by about 6 percent above their average sales price. The new proposal would reimburse hospitals for such drugs at 22.5 percent below their average sales price, effectively negating the discount. CMS says that this reform will lower out-of-pocket costs for patients, ensuring that the 340B program is actually benefiting Medicare patients and not just goosing the bottom line of 340B hospitals and doctors. The Trump administration heavily promoted the changes, even sending out a statement from Trump touting the reforms. But hospitals warned that the changes would hurt patients’ access to care by threatening the financial health of 340B hospitals. The payment rates aren’t final, and the agency is accepting comments on it. Expect a major fight to come. July 15 – 21 1. Reinstating property seizure In 2015, then-Attorney General Eric Holder reversed nearly three-decades of federal policy when he severely limited state and local police from using federal law to seize cash, cars and other personal property from crime suspects. (The Justice Department eventually allowed a very restricted version of the policy to resume last year.) That policy of enabling civil asset forfeiture (dubbed, euphemistically, Equitable Sharing), had enabled law enforcement to seize property worth $3 billion since 2008, a lucrative income source for cash-strapped police departments. But Democrats and Republicans alike had sharply criticized the whole idea, arguing that seizing assets from people who had not yet been convicted of a crime was a violation of due process—and a terrible incentive for police. On Wednesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a new policy guidance reinstating much of the old policy on civil asset forfeitures—with additional safeguards to prevent abuse, including for cash seizures of less than $10,000. Sessions and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, stressed that civil asset forfeitures, a policy that began at the start of the War on Drugs, would be critical for state and local police to combat the opioid crisis. But critics said the safeguards were too weak to guard against abuse and worried it was a reward to police departments for supporting Trump during the presidential campaign. Rosenstein denied that, but Trump has been receptive to requests from local police. In February, sheriffs from the National Sheriffs Association visited the White House and stressed to the president the need to reverse Holder’s policy. In the ensuing discussion, Trump didn’t seem to know much about asset forfeitures—but sided with the sheriffs. “Asset forfeiture,” he said, “we're going to go back on," okay?"""" 2. Trump’s first big regulatory blueprint Twice a year", the White House regulatory office releases a compendium of the regulatory agendas for all government agencies, from cabinet agencies like the Department of Labor to obscure independent entities like the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency. The compendium, called the “ Unified Agenda,” includes what rules the agency intends to issue and the timeline for issuing them and is highly anticipated by businesses, lawmakers and regulation experts. This spring’s version took on even more importance because it is Trump’s first Unified Agenda, the most comprehensive look at how his administration will approach the regulatory state. Experts are still picking through all of the information but a few broad themes are clear: Trump intends a far less active regulatory state than Obama, proposing fewer rules and more deregulatory actions, wiping Obama-era rules off-the-books. So what’s actually in it? There’s a lot: The Environmental Protection Agency intends to repeal Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which imposed limits on greenhouse gas emissions, although the EPA did not provide a specific timeline. The Bureau of Land Management also intends to repeal a rule on hydraulic fracking, the DOL will “reconsider” a rule requiring employers to track workplace injuries and illnesses and the Department of Homeland Security intends to issue a rule for returning border crossers to Mexico and Canada. In some cases, the absence of a rule is telling: The Agriculture Department, for instance, dropped multiple rules on organic products that were close to being finalized during the Obama administration. There’s lots more: Check out the entire Unified Agenda. 3. 15,000 additional visas for foreign workers During the presidential campaign, Trump blasted visa programs that allow foreign workers to temporarily work in the U.S. “[I will] institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program,” he promised in March, 2016. “No exceptions.” In turn, many immigration experts expected a crackdown on such programs under Trump. But on Monday, the Department of Homeland Security announced that it was granting businesses an additional 15,000 H-2B visas for low-skilled, non-agricultural workers for fiscal 2017. Congress had capped the H-2B program at 66,000 visas annually, but in last year’s spending bill, lawmakers granted DHS the authority to issue up to 69,000 additional H-2B visas. Critics called the provision a backdoor increase in foreign labor, allowing Washington to further undercut American workers, and hoped that the Trump administration would not use its new authority. But DHS determined that 15,000 extra visas were needed. John Kelly, the secretary of homeland security," justified the move as a “demonstration of the Administration's commitment to supporting American businesses” and DHS guidance said that hiring companies must attest that they are """"likely to suffer irreparable harm"""" without the extra workers", a standard that drew some praise from some H-2B critics. 4. Selling rice to China Trump blasted China for its trade practices during the presidential campaign but as president, the U.S. and China have found some real common ground on trade. They’ve reached agreements on beef, dairy and poultry. And this week, you can add rice to that list. On Thursday, the Department of Agriculture announced that China—the world’s biggest rice importer—would allow the U.S. to export rice into the country, the culmination of ten-plus years of negotiations. The U.S. rice industry praised the deal, which will allow American rice into the country after China conducts an audit of U.S. rice facilities. Of course, the trade relationship has some real sticking points. For instance, this week, the sides were unable to agree on a one-year plan on trade at the U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue, a talk between high-level American and Chinese officials. And Trump is expected to infuriate China by signing off on steep steel tariffs in the near future. Still, that Washington and Beijing are finding common ground on long-stalled trade issues is an unexpected development in Trump’s first six months, after he spent so much time bashing China during the campaign. 5. No more travelling to North Korea The death in June of Otto Warmbier, an American college student, after 18 months of captivity in North Korea sent shockwaves across the United States and provoked outrage from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, with many calling for a ban on travel to the North. Warmbier was convicted in 2016 to 15 years of hard labor after attempting to steal a poster from his hotel room. Two months into his sentence, he suffered a severe head injury; in June, North Korea released a comatose Warmbier to his family in the United States. He died a few days later. On Friday, State officially banned all Americans from travelling to the North Korea, “due to mounting concerns over the serious risk of arrest and long-term detention under North Korea’s system of law enforcement.” Officially, State is imposing a “Geographical Travel Restriction” on all U.S. citizens from using a passport to travel to North Korea and the Department said it may make exceptions for Americans traveling for humanitarian purposes. It’s unclear whether such a restriction can really stop Americans determined to enter the North—hundreds visit each year—but it sends a very clear message about the threat posed by Pyongyang. July 22 – 28 1. Trump targets Obama’s fuel economy standards On January 13, Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency attempted to lock in its 2022-2025 fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks, issuing a finding that wasn’t due for another 15 months. The goal was clear: block Trump from weakening the standards. But this week, the Trump administration made clear that those standards aren’t going to last. On Tuesday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began the process to write fuel efficiency regulations for years 2022-2025, seeking comment on an upcoming environmental review. Within the notice, the agency also offered clear signs that it is likely to weaken Obama’s fuel economy standards: It is considering freezing the fuel efficiency targets, instead of raising them each year as the Obama administration had proposed. It may also go back a year and review the 2021 fuel efficiency standards, which NHTSA issued in 2012. How can NHTSA issue new fuel efficiency standards if the EPA already issued them in January? Because the standards are, in fact, a dual effort between the EPA and NHTSA; the EPA issues a rule on greenhouse gas emissions from cars and light trucks while NHTSA issues a rule on fuel efficiency. So while the EPA attempted to lock in the 2022-2025 standards through its January rule, NHTSA must still go through a full rule-making process on its own to set the fuel economy standards, giving Trump an opening to weaken those rules. And it appears he’s going to do just that. 2. DOJ takes another swing at sanctuary cities For Sessions, the week was dominated by Trump’s repeated attacks on his job performance and questions about whether the president was setting the gears in motion to fire him. But at the Department of Justice, he was busy implementing Trump’s immigration agenda, imposing new restrictions on so-called sanctuary cities—states and localities that refuse to help the feds enforce immigration laws. The new policy, released Tuesday, imposes new restrictions on cities that receive certain grants from the DOJ. Cities that seek money under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program—known as “Byrne JAG”—must comply with two new conditions: They must give officials at the Department of Homeland Security at least 48 hours notice before releasing an undocumented immigrant from custody, and allow DHS authorities to visit state and local jails. The new policy is Trump’s first real attempt to crack down on sanctuary cities, a top campaign promise. With $347 million in funding this year, the Byrne JAG program is the largest federal grant for state and local law enforcement; cutting funding to sanctuary cities could leave a real budgetary hole for police departments. Will that actually happen? Political leaders of many sanctuary cities, such as San Francisco and Chicago, have already said they won’t change their immigration policies based on the new threat; they are also certain to sue the DOJ, arguing that the coercive use of grants is an unconstitutional use of government power. Like nearly all of Trump’s immigration agenda, the fate of his sanctuary city effort will likely be decided by the courts. 3. Obama’s overtime rule is in trouble In May 2016, Vice President Joe Biden announced a huge expansion of the Department of Labor’s overtime rule, which requires employers to pay employees time-and-a-half their regular wages for more than 40 hours of work. The revised rule expanded the definition for who qualified for overtime pay and raised the salary threshold under which most workers are required to receive overtime, from $23,660 to $47,476. The effort represented a top second-term priority for Obama—a unilateral attempt to give American workers a raise. But businesses hated the rule and sued the administration over it; when Obama left office, the rule hadn’t taken effect and remained in legal limbo. This week, the Trump administration sent a strong message that it will never take effect: The Labor Department kicked off the process to rewrite the rule, publishing a “ request for information ” that seeks comments from the public about further changes. The notice wasn’t exactly a surprise, since last month, the Trump administration declined to support the rule in a legal brief it filed in the ongoing lawsuit. But Tuesday’s news still represents the clearest sign that the Trump DOL doesn’t support Obama’s overtime rule and intends to roll it back. 4. Repealing Obama’s fracking rule In March 2015, the Interior Department released a high-profile rule governing hydraulic fracturing on public lands. The process, known as “fracking,” involves pumping millions of gallons of water into the earth to release oil and gas; it has helped make the U.S. one of the world’s leading oil and gas producers, but environmentalists have criticized it for worsening climate change, polluting groundwater and causing earthquakes. The rule was intended to impose stronger safety measures on fracking on public lands, requiring producers to safely store waste fluids and disclose what chemicals they use. But the rule never actually took effect, due to lawsuits from the oil and gas industry. Now, it’s on the verge of death. The Interior Department on Monday released a 33-page proposed rule to repeal the fracking regulation, saying the Obama-era rule was “unnecessarily duplicative of state and some tribal regulations and imposes burdensome reporting requirements and other unjustified costs on the oil and gas industry.” The agency is accepting comments for 60 days and will release a final rule soon thereafter. But it’s clear how this will end: The fracking rule is dead. 5. Ending an Obama retirement program In 2014, the Treasury Department created a new way for Americans to save for retirement, allowing people without access to a workplace retirement plan to open a starter account, known as a “myRA.” It was designed to encourage all Americans to save for retirement—without fees—and participants could contribute up to $5,500 a year from pre-tax earnings, a savings account or a federal tax refund. The Obama administration heavily promoted the program, but myRA never garnered much interest: Only about 20,000 people have opened accounts since it launched at the end of 2015. On Friday, the Treasury Department announced it was shutting down the myRA program; participants’ funds would be transitioned into Roth IRA accounts. The death of myRA isn’t a huge deal, given the limited enrollment. But Friday’s news still marks the end of a top Obama effort to expand retirement savings opportunities. July 29 – August 4 1. DHS waives laws to help build a border wall Congress doesn’t appear very interested in funding Trump’s promised wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Senate Republicans, for instance, introduced a $15 billion border security bill this week—and none of that money was earmarked for the wall. Democrats are refusing to vote for any bill that includes border wall money. But the Trump administration is continuing to take steps to build an actual, physical wall. On Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security issued a notice that it was waiving more than three dozen environmental laws in order to build border wall prototypes along a 15-mile border in the vicinity of San Diego, California. The waived laws include the Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water, and the Antiquities Act, freeing the government from costly regulations like environmental reviews. The notice is still a small move, since the department has only about $20 million to construct the prototypes—money repurposed from other accounts. But it’s another signal that Trump isn’t backing down from his wall. 2. Trump targets a major financial regulation In the aftermath of the financial crisis, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, a law intended to protect consumers, tighten up oversight of banks and prevent another deep recession. Republicans for years have complained that the law was unduly harsh, discouraging banks from lending and contributing to the slow economic recovery. On Wednesday, the Trump administration took a first step to reforming a major component of the law, known as “Volcker Rule,” which prevents banks from risking depositors’ money on certain speculative investments. The Office Comptroller of the Currency, an independent agency currently run by Acting Director Keith Noreika, who Trump appointed in May, requested comments on revising the Volcker Rule, a clear sign that he intends to change the underlying regulation. This won’t be a quick process: Dodd-Frank was passed in July, 2010 and the final Volcker Rule wasn’t released until December, 2013. Despite its seeming straightforward nature, the rule is incredibly complicated, running 272 pages and crafted by four agencies, along with the OCC. Any changes to the rule will require approval from those other agencies—the Federal Reserve, SEC, FDIC and CFTC. Still, the OCC’s notice is a clear message to Wall Street: a new cop is on the beat. 3. A setback for the Department of Education Sometimes rolling back Obama’s legacy is harder than expected. In May, Betsy DeVos, the secretary of education, announced that the Education Department would select a single company to service the agency’s $1.2 trillion portfolio of student loans. The Obama administration had intended to spread different aspects of loan management—such as consolidation, financial reporting, and default—among multiple companies. The move sparked an immediate backlash from Democrats, and some Republicans, who said competition was needed to ensure that servicers had the best interest of students at heart. This week, DeVos abandoned those plans, cancelling a solicitation for bids to manage the loan portfolio. The agency will now seek a new “more innovative approach” to managing the portfolio and is collecting feedback on how to do so. The reversal is a lesson for the Trump administration that Obama’s regulatory legacy is not always so easy to tear down. 4. State Department begins “extreme vetting” rule Much of Trump’s March executive order preventing people from six Muslim countries from entering the United States remains blocked by the courts. But the Trump administration is moving forward with the parts of it that aren’t blocked. On Thursday, the State Department published a notice in the Federal Register soliciting comments on its proposal to begin the “extreme vetting” that Trump promised in his campaign. The agency intends to collect a wide array of information on a “subset of visa applicants,” including their travel, address and employment histories, names of siblings and children and social media information. The proposal requires more information from applicants than the current visa application but doesn’t represent a radical departure from past department practices. The agency is accepting comments for 60 days and will issue a final decision soon thereafter. 5. The FDA makes a mixed move on tobacco In May 2016, the Food and Drug Administration in a landmark move imposed the first real rules on electronic cigarettes, banning their sale to people under the age of 18 and requiring companies to apply to the FDA for approval of the product. Democrats cheered the announcement for instituting long-overdue oversight of the industry while Republicans said it was misguided, potentially causing Americans to smoke regular cigarettes over the electronic versions. Under the FDA’s original rule, companies with markets currently on the market had two years to apply to the agency to market e-cigarettes and premium cigars. Earlier this year, the FDA extended that deadline by three months. Now, new FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is postponing that deadline for five years, effectively killing it for Trump’s entire first term. That looked like a rollback of tobacco restrictions—but at the same time, the agency said it would examine whether to lower the amount of nicotine in traditional cigarettes, a surprise announcement that worried the tobacco industry. The dual changes split the traditional party-line approach to tobacco regulation—Democrats in favor of it, Republicans against—and are sure to set up a knockdown fight with the industry if the FDA really does decide to reduce nicotine levels. Stay tuned. (And yes, we know—the announcement didn’t really come this week, but it was so late last Friday afternoon that it didn’t make our deadline for last week’s list.) August 5 – 11 1. Interior relaxes Obama-era Sage Grouse rules In September 2015, the Obama administration announced new protections for the sage grouse, a bird whose habitat happens to cover some of the most resource-rich lands in the American West. The administration declined to list the bird on the endangered species list—a big victory for oil and gas companies—but the new conservation plan included strong measures to protect sage grouse habitat. This week, the Interior Department, led by Secretary Ryan Zinke, began rolling back the conservation plan, directing the Bureau of Land Management to shrink the buffer zones between sage grouse breeding grounds, among other changes. Environmentalists slammed the move, saying it jeopardized the carefully crafted Obama-era compromise between oil and gas interests and environmental groups. The changes won’t take effect overnight: It can take years for the agency and states to implement new land-use policies that determine where companies can drill for gas and oil, but it was another big sign of the Interior Department’s new priorities under Zinke. 2. EPA eases the approval process for new chemicals Last year, in the largest revamp of America’s chemical safety laws in 40 years, Congress required that the Environmental Protection Agency examine “reasonably foreseen uses” of chemicals when they evaluate them for safety. The changes were designed to ensure that the EPA examines chemicals for their likely real-world impact, instead of narrowly evaluating them on the specific uses for which they were intended. On Monday, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt announced new “ operating principles ” for how the agency will apply the law. In a surprise, the EPA will first assess chemicals based only on their intended use—similar to how the agency operated before passage of the new law. If the EPA has any concerns about other potential uses, “as a general matter,” those will be adjudicated through a separate rule-making. In other words, new chemicals may still be approved while the EPA is reviewing their potential further impact—the exact outcome lawmakers were trying to avoid. The change is a big victory for industry groups, which wanted a lighter touch approach to regulation. Pruitt also announced Monday that the agency had cleared a backlog of 600 new chemicals awaiting approval—another move that drew praise from the chemical industry and strong rebukes from consumer groups. 3. DOJ switches sides in Ohio voting case Under Obama, the Department of Justice frequently challenged voter ID laws and similar state-level laws in court, arguing they unfairly affected minority voters while “solving” a voter-fraud problem that was essentially nonexistent. Under Trump, the DOJ is taking the opposite position; this week the Justice Department reversed its position on a controversial Ohio voting law, under which the state has purged tens of thousands of people from the voter rolls if they haven’t cast a ballot in the past two years and don’t respond to a piece of mail asking them to confirm their registration. The Obama-era DOJ had argued that the Ohio law discriminated against minorities and thus violated federal voting laws, but in a filing on Monday, the department said it had reconsidered its position and determined that the Ohio voting roll purge was legal. Since the election, Trump has repeatedly claimed—without evidence—that millions of people cast illegal ballots, allowing Hillary Clinton to win the popular vote. In response, he created a commission to investigate voter fraud, led by controversial Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, which has done little so far. In addition, the Justice Department in February, dropped its opposition to a Texas voter ID law, a major shift that signaled the priorities of the new administration. 4. The fiduciary standard gets punted Perhaps the biggest financial reform of the late Obama era was the “fiduciary rule,” the 2015 Obama regulation that requires investment advisers to act in the best interest of their clients when selling products like retirement investments. (The concern was that many advisers were pushing investments with a higher commission for the adviser, rather than a better return for the client.) It was assumed to be doomed under the new administration, but Democrats enjoyed a brief moment of celebration in May when Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that he would allow the rule to take effect in early June. It now appears the celebration was premature. Only part of the rule took effect in June, and the Labor Department isn’t enforcing that part until the entire rule takes effect on January 1, 2018. But now even that won’t be happening: This week, in a court filing, the Labor Department revealed that it had sent a rule to the White House for review that would delay full implementation of the fiduciary rule for 18 months, until July 1, 2019—enough time for the Trump administration to make significant changes or repeal it altogether. 5. The nuclear waste storage fight warms up Where should America stash its spent nuclear fuel? A decades-old plan to create a central dumping site in Nevada’s Yucca Mountain stalled out during the Obama administration, with Nevada powerhouse Harry Reid leading Democrats in the Senate. But the Trump administration has re-opened that dormant fight over the past few months, and it’s starting to really heat up. First, Trump requested $120 million in his 2018 budget to restart the licensing process for the Yucca site. Then, in June, Energy Secretary Rick Perry announced that he was reconstituting the key office that oversaw the Nevada site for long-term waste storage, setting off protests from Nevada lawmakers and forcing Perry to walk back some of this comments. This week, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission released a memo—dated July 31—directing staff to conduct preliminary “information-gathering” on restarting the licensing process. This is a small step, a $110,000 effort to “re-establish infrastructure” to get the licensing process underway. But it’s another sign that Trump is serious about storing nuclear waste in the Yucca site. This fight is just getting underway. August 12 – 18 1. DHS ends parole program for Central American children In November 2014, Vice President Joe Biden announced that the Obama administration was taking steps to stem that summer’s border crisis, in which tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors flooded into the United States from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The State Department set up a program to allow the children of parents who are lawfully present in the U.S. to seek refugee or parole status while still in their home countries — without actually making the dangerous journey to the United States. The goal was to reduce the flow of unaccompanied children without leaving them in danger. On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security immediately ended the parole component of that program; DHS canceled the approvals of 2,700 kids who had been conditionally approved for parole but had not received final signoff. The program was small—about 1,400 kids had been paroled and entered the United States—but had still angered immigration hawks who said it was too generous to the children. The announcement follows Trump’s executive order in February in which he directed the three main immigration agencies to use parole “sparingly.” It will please immigration hawks who have long criticized the way officials use parole, but it also carries some risk: The number of unaccompanied minors dropped by almost half in fiscal 2015, and ticked up again last year. The exact reasons for the drop are unknown, but the parole program may have been part of the reason. (The children are still eligible to apply for refugee status without crossing into the U.S., but that bar is higher.) Trump’s repeal of the program could persuade them to head north without U.S. approval, illegally crossing the border. 2. The end of an Obama health care payment experiment While most of the attention on Obamacare has focused on the individual insurance market and the Medicaid expansion, the law also tests numerous ideas to lower the spiraling cost of health care. One approach is known as “bundled payments,” which institutes a fixed price for certain medical procedures, like hip surgery or knee replacement. If the hospital could perform the procedure for a lower cost, it kept the difference. If not, it lost money. The Obama administration had begun testing the concept of bundled payments through a few different programs—with mandatory participation by hospitals that take Medicare money. The mandated participation always irked Tom Price, the former congressman and current secretary of Health and Human Services, and this week, he significantly scaled back those programs. Hospitals will no longer be required to participate in a bundled payment program for certain joint replacements in many markets. Two yet-to-launch bundled care programs—an expansion of the existing joint replacements program and a new program for heart attacks and cardiac surgeries—were canceled altogether. The rollback isn’t a repudiation of “value-based-care,” the movement to pay doctors for quality over quantity, which has bipartisan support. But it does scale back one of the goals of the Affordable Care Act, which was keeping costs under control, and signals that Price, a former physician, will be less aggressive in forcing the new payment system on hospitals, a victory for doctors who are critical of the new payment plans and a defeat for health officials seeking a rapid transition. 3. EPA’s regulatory rollback continues No agency has been more aggressive than the Environmental Protection Agency in undoing Obama-era regulations and the August recess has not slowed down the agency. This week, EPA said it would reconsider two more rules, one on the toxic discharges from coal plants and another on emissions standards for heavy-duty trucks. On Monday, in a court filing, Pruitt said EPA would conduct a rule-making to “potentially revise” a 2015 rule from the Obama administration that set limits on the dumping of toxic metals, like mercury, from coal-fired power plants. The news wasn’t a surprise, since Pruitt issued a rule earlier this spring delaying the compliance dates of the Obama-era rule. Then, on Thursday, EPA announced that it would review certain parts of the agency’s 2016 rule that set emissions standards on heavy trucks for model years 2021-27. It was seen as one of Obama’s last big pushes for cleaner air, as the Obama-era EPA attempted to lock down as many climate rules as possible, before a climate-skeptic administration took over. 4. The end of “Operation Choke Point” In 2013, the Department of Justice announced a new initiative to cut off certain predatory lenders and online merchants from the banking system by cracking down on banks and payment processors. The idea was to pressure banks, as potential facilitators of potential financial crimes, to cease doing business with those companies. The program, officially called Operation Choke Point, was heavily criticized by Republicans who said DOJ was targeting legal businesses that the Obama administration just happened to dislike, like payday lenders and gun retailers, without any evidence of wrongdoing. This week, in a letter to the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, DOJ said it would end Operation Choke Point, which it called a “misguided initiative.” The move is a victory for Republicans and industries like payday lenders who felt targeted by the program. 5. A flurry of small trade deals In the trade world, all eyes were on Washington where American, Canadian and Mexican officials converged for the first session on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. But the Trump administration also made a series of small trade announcements this week to coincide with Vice President Mike Pence’s trip through four South American countries. In Colombia, Pence announced that the Colombian government would lift restrictions on a certain type of U.S. rice exports, while the U.S. will now allow the import of Colombian avocados. In Argentina, Pence inked a deal to allow the export of U.S. pork products for the first time since 1992, opening up a potential $10 million per year pork market to U.S. producers. Finally, the Department of Agriculture announced that South Korea was lifting its ban on U.S. poultry and egg products, which was imposed in March after a series of bird flu cases in the United States. All these deals are dwarfed by top issues under discussion as part of the NAFTA renegotiation. But they continue to show that career officials can make progress on sticky trade issues, willing to compromise with foreign nations despite Trump’s at-times bellicose trade rhetoric. August 19 – 25 1. The State Department turns up the heat on Egypt When Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi visited the White House in April, Trump lavished the foreign leader with praise, saying he’s doing a “fantastic job in a very difficult situation” and that “we are very much behind President al-Sisi.” Those comments drew a sharp rebuke from human-rights groups that had been sharply critical of Sisi’s human rights record. So, it came as some surprise this week when the State Department delayed $200 million in aid to Egypt and cut another $100 million in aid altogether. State officials said the move was a result of Egypt’s human rights record, including a new law that restricts the activities of nongovernmental organizations. But experts also suggested another motive: isolating North Korea. Egypt has historically had ties to North Korea, with North Korean pilots training Egyptian pilots in the 1970s. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert did not deny that North Korea was a reason for the cuts in aid, saying, “We have a deep and multifaceted relationship with the country of Egypt. We have a lot of areas of close cooperation.” The move also created troubles for White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, who was scheduled to meet top Egyptian leaders, including Sisi, this week to talk about the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. A meeting between Kushner and Egypt’s foreign minister was canceled at the last minute, potentially a rebuke to State’s move, though it otherwise did not appear to significantly disrupt the trip. 2. Interior could shrink national monuments In his final weeks in office, Barack Obama protected over 1.5 million acres of federal land from development by designating national monuments in the West, a final attempt to solidify his environmental legacy. Republican lawmakers, oil and gas interests and fishing and hunting groups blasted the move and appealed to Trump to review the designations. In April, they got their wish when Trump directed the Interior Department to review all monument designations larger than 100,000 acres all the way back to 1996. On Thursday, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke delivered that review to the White House. He didn’t release it publicly, instead publishing a vague two-page fact sheet ; in an interview with The Associated Press, Zinke said he was not recommending any monuments be rescinded but was suggesting a “handful” of changes. The New York Times later reported that Zinke recommended shrinking at least four monuments. It’s unclear whether—or when—the White House will accept the recommendations. But given Trump’s commitment to rolling back Obama’s environmental legacy, Zinke’s recommendations will likely find a favorable reception in the Oval Office. And if it does, it would be historic—no national monument has been shrunk by a president since 1963. 3. The White House changes American research priorities Every year, the government funds billions of dollars in research, from large National Institutes of Health grants to small housing experiments. The sheer magnitude of money gives the government great influence over the direction of research across industries, a hidden lever for a sophisticated administration to guide the country well into the future. This week, the Trump administration revealed that it intends to use that lever. The Office of Management and Budget, led by Director Mick Mulvaney, published a four-page memo —dated August 27—that lays out the administration’s research and development priorities for fiscal 2019, which includes a focus on military technologies, border security and treatments for drug addiction. In a break from the Obama administration’s efforts to combat climate change, there is almost no mention of environmental research, with the exception of one reference to renewable energy. The memo also directs agencies to focus on early stage research and, in a bolded section, strongly recommends the use of quantitative data to evaluate any R&amp;D investments, terminating those in which “federal involvement is no longer needed or appropriate.” The real-world effects of such a memo won’t be immediately apparent. Research projects generally operate on a multiyear time frame, so the White House can’t just shift the direction of federal R&amp;D overnight. But these priorities can eventually have big policy implications as researchers focus on certain issues and ignore others. That assumes, of course, that there is actual R&amp;D funding to disburse for research—and if Trump has his way, that may not be the case. The White House has proposed huge cuts to research programs, rolling back federal nondefense R&amp;D by almost 20 percent. Republicans and Democrats alike have rejected those cuts, so they will not become law. While that may be disappointing to a fiscal conservative like Mulvaney, it does help the administration in one sense: More R&amp;D money gives agencies greater influence over the direction of American research. 4. The Amazon-Whole Foods merger sails through Trump’s disdain for Amazon and its CEO, Jeff Bezos, who owns The Washington Post," is well known. """"Is Fake News Washington Post being used as a lobbyist weapon against Congress to keep Politicians from looking into Amazon no-tax monopoly?"""" Trump tweeted in July. Last week", he wrote," """"Amazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers."""" Despite those attacks", Amazon had no problem receiving approval from regulators to acquire the grocery giant Whole Foods. Although the deal has alarmed some antitrust watchers, who worry that Amazon’s expansion is undermining competition in the long run by driving out competitors through its low prices, it barely hit a speed bump in Washington: The Federal Trade Commission released a short statement saying it had completed its investigation into the $13.7 billion deal, which was announced in June, and isn’t going to challenge it. The quick approval also assuaged concerns that Trump would attempt to interfere in the regulatory review for political reasons. The deal is set to close on Monday. Amazon promptly announced that it will cut prices on a wide array of Whole Foods products, from avocados to tilapia, on Monday and intends to introduce benefits at Whole Foods stores for its Prime members. 5. Trump ratchets up sanctions During his first few months in office, Trump attempted to woo Chinese President Xi Jinping, even saying he would relax his trade stance if China applied more pressure to North Korea. But those efforts have fizzled in the past few months, even as North Korea’s nuclear program has continued to advance. This week, the administration took another unilateral step to stop Pyongyang’s nuclear ambitions when the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Chinese and Russian individuals and entities, an effort to reduce North Korea’s exports, which it uses to finance its nuclear program, and to choke off its access to the global financial system. The move is the second time in two months that Trump has sanctioned Chinese entities over North Korea. In addition, on Friday, the White House also announced new sanctions on Venezuela that attempt to cut financing to the country and its state-owned oil company. August 26 – September 1 1. Police can buy military equipment again In August,2014, after the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown, the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, looked something like a war zone as protesters set fires and police responded with camo-clad snipers and armored vehicles the result of a decades-long program allowing local law enforcement agencies to receive surplus military equipment. The controversial image of police rolling in on their own citizens like an army roused Obama into action. Nine months later, his administration prohibited the transfer of certain equipment, such as grenade launchers and armored vehicles, to local police departments and limited the transfer of other items such as drones, riot gear and explosives. Such equipment, the administration determined," didn’t serve a purpose for local law enforcement agencies. """"Some equipment made for the battlefield is not appropriate for local police departments",” Obama said. On Monday, Trump rescinded the Obama-era executive order limiting the transfer of surplus military equipment to local law enforcement agencies. Now police departments can again buy previously restricted guns, ammunition, and riot gear, as well as other military-style equipment like grenade launchers, according to a Department of Justice fact sheet. The changes are a victory for local law enforcement agencies that believe the equipment helps keep their officers—and the public—safe. But it was sharply criticized by civil liberties groups and even received some pushback from Republicans like Sen. Rand Paul. “It is one thing for federal officials to work with local authorities to reduce or solve crime,” Paul said, “but it is another for them to subsidize militarization.” 2. Trump nixes an Obama policy to reduce pay discrimination Last year, the Obama administration made a final attempt to reduce the racial and gender pay gaps, finalizing changes to a form—the EEO-1—that requires employers to report workplace demographics. Under the revised form, employers with more than 100 workers would have to report pay data by race, ethnicity and gender. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the agency responsible for the form changes, could have then used the data to launch an investigation into discrimination. The changes were set to take effect March 2018. But this week, the White House directed the EEOC to stop the changes and instead use the original EEO-1 form, saying the changes “lack practical utility, are unnecessarily burdensome, and do not adequately address privacy and confidentiality issues.” Labor and civil rights groups criticized the roll-back, arguing that the new form was a crucial means to get employers to address continued unfair pay disparities. Business groups praised the move, saying the form changes created an unnecessary paperwork burden that would ultimately hurt growth and wages. 3. The fiduciary standard gets delayed for more than a year One of Obama’s final financial reforms was the “fiduciary standard,” a dry-sounding policy that essentially means stockbrokers can’t put their own interests ahead of their clients’. In May, Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta announced in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that he would let the fiduciary standard take effect as planned on June 9. But that wasn’t the full story: Only some parts of the rule, which requires financial advisers to act in the best interests of their clients, took effect on that date; the rest of the rule takes effect on January 1, and it quickly became clear that Acosta wasn’t going to let that happen. First, at the end of June, he asked for information from the public about changing the law. Then, this week, the DOL published a proposed rule delaying the effective date 18 months, until July 1, 2019. This wasn’t a surprise: in a court filing earlier this month, the agency said it had proposed an 18-month delay. This is just a proposed rule, so the agency must still accept comments and issue a final regulation. But it’s clear that Acosta intends to delay, and likely substantively reform, the fiduciary rule. In the meantime, the agency said earlier this year that it wouldn’t actually enforce the portions of the rule that took effect in June—meaning, in effect, the rule has now been mostly mothballed. 4. Trump’s trade fights with Canada continue During his presidential campaign, Trump railed against China’s trade practices—but he hasn’t done much to improve them since taking office, breaking his promise to name Beijing a currency manipulator and delaying investigations into steel imports from China. Instead, he has targeted a friendly country much closer to home: Canada. He has, for example, reopened NAFTA negotiations with Canada and Mexico and imposed duties on certain Canadian products, including lumber. This week, the trade fight with Canada took a bit of a surprising turn when the Commerce Department delayed preliminary antidumping duties on certain Canadian lumber companies to give the two countries additional time to negotiate a settlement. In effect, the delay temporarily lifts the 7 percent to 8 percent duties that Commerce had imposed earlier this summer. The agency must make a final determination on the duties by November 14. In less surprising news, on Thursday, Commerce opened an investigation into certain types of Canadian paper, the first step toward imposing penalties for unfair trade practices. Neither of these trade moves is especially important to the economy, but they are additional evidence that Trump’s trade agenda, so far, is far softer than the bombastic threats he leveled on the campaign trail. Together with his limited actions against Chinese trade policy, his agenda appears almost … conventional. 5. The diplomatic rift with Russia continues Trump entered office hoping to improve relations with Russia, saying it was “absolutely possible” to ease tensions with Moscow. But the relationship has only spiraled downward as Trump has faced multiple investigations into potential collusion between Trump campaign officials and the Russian government. Things are only getting worse: After Trump reluctantly signed into law new sanctions against Russia, President Vladimir Putin reacted angrily, ordering the U.S. to cut its diplomatic staff in Russia by 755 people. This week, the Trump administration responded by forcing Russia to close three diplomatic compounds, located in San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and New York City. The State Department, in announcing the retaliation, issued a sharply worded statement, saying the initial Russian action was “unwarranted and detrimental to the overall relationship between our countries.” The move is just the latest sign that Moscow and Washington aren't on better terms, even with Trump in the White House. September 2 – 8 1. Trump sets a new goal for deregulation Trump hasn’t had any big legislative wins, but he has succeeded at clogging up the regulatory system—the “deconstruction of the administrative state,” in the words of former chief strategist Steve Bannon. In one of his first actions as president, Trump directed the White House budget office to set an annual cap on regulatory costs for each agency—that is, the total economic costs of all new regulatory and deregulatory actions. For the rest of fiscal 2017, the cap was zero, meaning whatever an agency does this year, it can’t increase net costs at all. But what would the cap be in fiscal 2018? On Thursday, the Office of Management and Budget provided an answer: Agencies are expected to “propose a net reduction in total incremental regulatory costs.” In other words, the economic cost of federal regulations must go down. The policy, which was implemented in an agency-wide memo, doesn’t apply to every regulation; many rules are exempt because their costs are minimal, they are required by law or they are related to national security, among other reasons. And OMB still can issue agencies a waiver if officials deem it necessary. But for most major regulations—the type of health and safety rules that get significant attention—the policy could impose new restrictions on agencies’ ability to issue new rules, experts said. An OMB official did not respond to a request for comment. Given the Trump administration’s focus on deregulation, experts weren’t exactly surprised by the memo. They noted that it just “expects” agencies to cut regulatory costs—it doesn’t require it. But it still represents a dramatic shift in how agencies have traditionally regulated. For all Trump’s deregulatory successes in his first seven-plus months in office, his bigger war on the regulatory system may just be beginning. 2. DOJ takes another swipe at sanctuary cities In late July, the administration made its first real attempt to follow through on Trump’s campaign promise to cut federal funding for sanctuary jurisdictions, like San Francisco or Chicago, which don’t help the federal government enforce immigration laws. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that in order to receive money from the “Byrne Jag” grant, a $347 million program that is critical for local law enforcement, cities must effectively shed their sanctuary status. The change made national headlines and provoked immediate outcry from sanctuary cities, which are challenging the policy in court. Less noticed, on Thursday, Sessions announced that nonsanctuary jurisdictions would get “priority consideration” in another grant program run by the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services. While smaller than the Byrne Jag program, the COPS grant program is still large: State and local law enforcement agencies received around $160 million from it in fiscal 2016. The change has gone largely unnoticed around the country, but represents perhaps the clearest shift in priorities from the Obama Justice Department to the Trump Justice Department. While Obama used the COPS program to favor law enforcement agencies that promoted trust between officers and the community through accountability and “honest recognition of past and present obstacles,” Trump and Sessions are using it to further their immigration crackdown. 3. The EPA’s Clean Power Plan repeal is coming soon Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump railed against Obama’s environmental agenda and promised to undo his Clean Power Plan, which imposed limits on greenhouse gas emissions. In March, he took the first step towards doing just that when he directed the Environmental Protection Agency to review the rule. So it came as a surprise this summer when the EPA revealed that it wouldn’t take action on its review of the plan in the next year. It turns out, that wasn’t correct. The agency announced in a court filing this week that its previous timeline was wrong: It’s going to issue a proposed new rule on the Clean Power Plan—likely a repeal—in the next few months. In fact, the rule has been under review at the White House since early June. Expect to hear more about it soon. September 9 – 15 1. DHS suspends some visas for four countries When the government orders someone deported from the U.S., that deportation doesn’t just happen automatically. It requires approval from the receiving country; the U.S. generally can’t just leave people in other countries. Most countries routinely approve such removal orders, but about a dozen countries are uncooperative, preventing the U.S. from actually deporting those individuals. On Wednesday, the Trump administration took its first step to force greater cooperation when it imposed visa sanctions on four especially recalcitrant countries—Cambodia, Eritrea, Guinea and Sierra Leone. “These four countries have not established reliable processes for issuing travel documents to their nationals ordered removed from the United States,” the Department of Homeland Security said. According to DHS numbers, the government has been unable to remove around 700 Eritrean,1,900 Cambodian,2,100 Guinean and 800 Sierra Leone nationals. The sanctions vary for each country. For instance, senior Cambodian diplomatic officials and their families will be unable to get a B visa, which allows temporary entry into the U.S. for business or pleasure. In Eritrea, no one can get a B visa. The move is just the latest front of Trump’s immigration crackdown, and follows on his January executive order in which he directed DHS and the State Department to enter negotiations with such “recalcitrant countries”—and, if those negotiations fail, enforce sanctions. 2. The first Trump-era guidelines on driverless cars Last September, the Obama administration issued the first guidelines on driverless cars, recommending industrywide standards to support the growth of the burgeoning industry. The guidelines, which were nonbinding, requested that automakers submit to a 15-point “safety assessment,” touching on everything from the testing of driverless vehicles to the prevention of vehicle hacking. On Tuesday, the Trump administration issued the first update to those guidelines, replacing the 15-point safety assessment with 12 “safety elements” that touch on many of the same issues. Consumer groups and industry officials said the plan was more industry-friendly, with significant emphasis on the voluntary nature of the guidelines. (The word “voluntary” appears 57 times in the 36-page document, compared with just five times in the original 116-page guidelines.) Critics said that the plan effectively imposes no rules on automakers, while industry officials said the light regulatory touch is essential to continued technological improvement. This is just the beginning of what’s likely to be a long drama over federal driverless-car policy; both the House and Senate are considering legislation that would enable greater federal oversight over the industry, which, in some instances, actually wants the rules to avoid a patchwork of state laws. Expect more in the months and years ahead. 3. EPA’s regulatory roll back continues Another week brought more regulatory rollbacks at the Environmental Protection Agency. On Wednesday, the EPA delayed for two years parts of an Obama-era rule limiting the dumping of toxic metals, like mercury, from coal-fired water plants. The delay affects two provisions of the 2015 rule, relating to specific waste products, while allowing the remainder of the rule to take effect as planned. The news wasn’t exactly a surprise, as EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has previously said the agency intended to change parts of the rule. He now has plenty of time to do so. Also on Wednesday, Pruitt sent a letter to industry officials—released on Thursday by the environmental group Earthjustice—saying that the EPA would “reconsider” another Obama-era rule, issued in 2015, that set standards for the disposal of “coal ash,” which is a byproduct from burning coal. That rule was the first national standard on coal ash disposal and also imposed new inspection rules to prevent leaks or spills. A formal reconsideration process doesn’t necessarily mean that the agency will change the coal ash rule, but it gives them the opportunity to do so. Any changes would have to go through the full rule-making process, including notice and comment. 4. Trump blocks the Chinese purchase of a U.S. company For years, Chinese companies have been on a buying spree in America, investing around $45 billion in U.S. companies in 2016, according to one estimate. The surge in investment has raised questions about Beijing’s ultimate aim and has focused renewed attention on the agency that reviews foreign investments for national security risks, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. On Wednesday, the Trump administration made its first big statement about Chinese investment when it blocked the acquisition of a U.S.-based semiconductor company, Lattice Semiconductor Corp., by a Chinese venture capital fund. The move came after CFIUS, which is chaired by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, recommended that the administration block the sale. The White House immediately blasted out a statement on the deal, using its bully pulpit to gain extra attention. It’s a sign that Trump intends to be vigilant about Chinese investment in American companies, which should delight experts who have called for a more comprehensive and wide-ranging approach to U.S. policy on China. 5. Labor Department makes two moves This week, the Department of Labor took two moves, one that actually continued to uphold an Obama-era rule and another that pushed one back. The first was Obama’s 2014 executive order that established a minimum wage for federal contractors. Under that order, federal contractors and subcontractors were required to pay their workers $10.10 per hour, starting in 2015. Trump could rescind that order with the stroke of a pen—but he hasn’t. That was made clear this week when the Labor Department issued a notice that the contractor minimum wage would rise to $10.35 next year, an annual inflation update required under the order. It’s unclear how many contractors are affected by the order; in fact, there isn’t an exact estimate for how many federal contractors are used by the government. But the Obama administration estimated it was hundreds of thousands. Also this week, the Mine Safety and Health Administration, within the DOL, delayed a rule regarding workplace examinations of metal and nonmetal mines. MSHA had already delayed the rule, which was finalized on Jan. 23 and initially set to take effect on May 23. It was first delayed until Oct. 2; the new proposed rule would extend that deadline until March 2, 2018. The agency also proposed changes to the rule regarding when daily inspections must take place and exempting from the examination record any safety or health problems that are quickly corrected. September 16 – 22 1. Trump administration hints at big Medicare experiments The Center for Medicaid and Medicare Innovation, created in 2010 by Obamacare, can spend $1 billion a year on innovative ideas to reduce Medicare costs. Under Obama, the agency piloted a number of ideas, such as reducing Medicare payments for cancer drugs and changing how the government pays for hip surgery. Republicans complained of executive overreach and tried to scale back the agency’s powers, but now that Trump is in the White House, the GOP is looking to turn the agency to its advantage. This week, the Trump administration took the first step toward reforming CMMI when it released a nine-page notice asking for comments on a “new direction” for the agency. The notice is just a preliminary move—it doesn’t actually change any policy right now—but it sends a clear message about how Tom Price, secretary of Health and Human Services, and Seema Verma, director of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, intend to use the agency. The notice emphasizes the need for a more “market-based” direction, saying consumers should be empowered “to drive change in the health system through their choices.” The notice doesn’t specify any policy changes but the language may signal that Price and Verma want to test Medicare premium support, an idea long favored by Ryan and Price. Instead of paying for health care, premium support would change Medicare into an insurance subsidy that recipients would use to purchase private insurance. The idea is extremely controversial and loathed by Democrats. A few days after the election, Price and Ryan suggested that transitioning Medicare to a premium support system would be on the agenda for the Republican Congress. Almost a year later, Republicans have struggled to repeal and replace Obamacare, much less undertake a comprehensive Medicare reform. But even if premium support isn’t on the table right now, Price and Verma could lay the groundwork for it through CMMI. 2. Labor Department delays a rule on cancer-causing silica dust In March 2016, the Department of Labor issued a regulation lowering the workplace exposure standard for silica, a mineral that can cause lung cancer when ground into dust and inhaled. The final rule was heralded by workplace advocates as long overdue—it took more than four decades to finalize—and was set to be enforced on June 23. But in April, the Department of Labor announced it was delaying enforcement of the rule for three months until September 23. Technically, that date still stands. But this week, the agency issued a memo, saying that as long as employers show they have made a “good faith effort” to comply with the rule, the agency will give them a pass for any violations in the next 30 days. In other words, the silica rule is effectively delayed another month. The delay is a victory for industry groups, but it is likely to be short-lived: Unlike with some other rules, the Labor Department does not appear to be delaying the enforcement date of the silica rule to give itself additional time to repeal or rewrite it. 3. Trump issues new executive order on North Korea Trump spent much of his time at the United Nations this week addressing North Korea’s nuclear program, vowing to “totally destroy” the country if necessary and discussing the topic in almost every meeting with foreign leaders. With each successive nuclear test, Washington tries to ratchet up pressure on Pyongyang, issuing new sanctions and pressuring China to cut off trade with North Korea. So it was this week when Trump announced an executive order that attempts to further cut off North Korea from the world. The sanctions are a step beyond anything that the U.S. has imposed on Pyongyang in the past, drawing praise from former Obama administration officials. The order allows the Treasury Department to sanction any individual who operates in major North Korean industries like textiles and manufacturing; who owns or operates North Korean ports; who imports or exports significant goods, services or technology to or from North Korea; or who generates revenue for the government. It also prohibits any foreign-owned aircraft or vessel from coming to the U.S. within 180 days of visiting North Korea. 4. EPA delays its formaldehyde rule, again On Dec. 12, the Environmental Protection Bureau issued a rule on formaldehyde emissions for certain wood products, one of the last significant rules issued by the EPA during the Obama administration. The rule was set to take effect on Feb. 27, but Trump already delayed that date twice: first to March 21 and later until May 22. At that point, the rule took effect. But this week, the EPA announced that it was effectively delaying the formaldehyde rule another year by extending the rule’s compliance deadlines. In other words, even though the rule took effect, companies don’t yet actually have to comply with different pieces of the rule until sometime in the future. In some cases, the new compliance deadline is far in the future—in one case, not until 2024. 5. A smaller move on immigration—and a big one coming soon This week, the Department of Homeland Security made one small move on immigration—and there are reports that a big policy change is coming soon. First, DHS extended a special immigration status for Sudanese and South Sudanese nationals that had been set to expire later this year. The status, known as Temporary Protected Status, allows foreign nationals whose home country is hit by a war or natural disaster to temporarily live and work in the U.S. Sudanese nationals can now stay until November 2018, while South Sudanese nationals can stay until May 2019. It’s a sign that despite Trump’s immigration crackdown, DHS isn’t just deporting all foreign nationals without considering their individual circumstances. Be that as it may, there’s more change afoot. The Trump administration is reportedly preparing to impose tighter vetting procedures on a broad list of countries, a replacement for Trump’s travel ban, which attempted to block people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. The ban, which has been tied up in the courts, expires on September 24, so the Trump administration had to make a decision. Expect more on the new vetting program in the coming days. September 23 – 29 1. A new bank enforcement policy In the pantheon of bank regulators, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission doesn’t get much attention. The CFTC is an obscure agency, but it plays a crucial role in the financial system: regulating derivatives, a $483 trillion market that contains some of the financial instruments that caused the financial crisis. This week, the CFTC’s new director of enforcement, James McDonald, announced a new regulatory strategy that has drawn sharp pushback from financial watchdogs. In a speech Monday night in New York City, McDonald said that financial institutions that self-report wrongdoings and cooperate with the ensuing investigations will receive “concrete benefits” from the CFTC, including reduced penalties. He said the program isn’t intended to give banks or individuals a “pass” for their misdeeds, but instead aligns the incentives between regulators and financial institutions to reduce financial crimes while putting the CFTC’s limited resources to the best use. He also said he doesn’t just intend to punish ground-level traders, but to work his way up the chain of command, targeting executives and other managers. For an agency with a budget of just $250 million, this enforcement strategy sounds like a common-sense approach. But financial watchdogs, who were critical of the CFTC under Barack Obama, are skeptical that it will lead to tougher enforcement, doubting that banks can—or will—effectively police themselves. It’s not exactly clear how the new enforcement strategy will work in practice, or how different it will actually be from the Obama administration’s approach. But given the Trump administration’s bank-friendly actions so far, including targeting many Dodd-Frank rules, many financial watchers see the move as the first step toward a lighter touch regulatory regime. 2. Trump’s trade battle with Canada intensifies For all the talk of going after China and Mexico, Trump’s biggest trade battle so far seems to be with our close ally Canada—a puzzling fight that ramped up Tuesday when Commerce imposed giant duties—more than 219 percent—on Canadian aircraft-maker Bombardier. The highly watched case began after Boeing formally petitioned against the Canadian company, accusing it of unfairly benefiting from government subsidies in a $5.6 billion deal last year to sell regional jets to Delta. Canadian leaders had heavily opposed the move; last week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and British Prime Minister Theresa May—Bombardier is based in Northern Ireland—appeared together to publicly lobby against the duties, arguing that Boeing didn’t even sell the type of regional aircraft involved in the Delta deal. The duties are just preliminary, and thus won’t be finalized until early 2018, when the International Trade Commission, an independent agency, will rule on whether the practices actually harmed any U.S. manufacturer. Canada already has threatened to retaliate: If the ITC rules to make the duties permanent, Trudeau has said that Canada will not buy any of Boeing’s F-18 Super Hornet jets, a deal worth more than $5 billion. Even the preliminary duties, though, are sure to increase tensions between the two neighbors, as the North American Free Trade Agreement renegotiations approach a self-imposed, end-of-year deadline. 3. A new environmental rule gets an expiration date During the final days of the Obama administration, the Department of Transportation finalized a rule to require states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from big highway projects, a final piece of Obama’s environmental legacy. The rule was set to take effect on February 17, but the DOT has repeatedly delayed it, first until March 21 and then to May 20—then, for key pieces of the rule, indefinitely. This week, facing lawsuits from environmental groups and state attorneys general, the department finally relented, allowing the entire rule to take effect—but with a big caveat: The rule is going away next spring. In a notice announcing that it was allowing the rule to take effect, the DOT also said it “has initiated additional rule-making procedures proposing to repeal the [greenhouse gas] measure.” In other words, the news is a short-term victory for environmentalists and state attorneys general—but it won’t last long. 4. Interior Department rolls back Obama-era sage grouse protections In September 2015, the Bureau of Land Management within the Interior Department finalized its plan to protect a funky-looking bird, the Sage Grouse, whose habitat sits on some of the most resource-rich land in the United States. The plan was something of a compromise between conservation groups and oil and gas companies, creating 98 separate land-use plans throughout the West that provided new protections for the Sage Grouse—but the department declined to list the bird on the endangered species list. This week, the Interior Department announced it will reconsider those plans, a first step toward overhauling a key Obama-era environmental policy and opening up more land to oil and gas drilling. The announcement was not exactly a surprise: BLM has previously relaxed some rules around Sage Grouse habitats and an advisory report commissioned by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, which was released this summer, recommended broader changes to the Sage Grouse rules. Still, the news is a victory for oil and gas interests who support more drilling opportunities on federal lands and a defeat for conservationists who slammed the news as an attack on the environment and said the overhaul could eventually lead to the Sage Grouse being labeled an endangered species. The changes won’t take effect overnight, as Interior’s announcement is just a first step in a long process—and yet another sign that under Zinke, federal land management policies are turning in a new direction. 5. Trump takes a small step toward constructing his border wall. Democrats in Congress have refused to provide any money for Trump’s wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, denying the president the chance to complete a key campaign promise—so far. But Trump continues to take baby steps toward constructing his wall. This week, U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced that it had begun construction on eight wall prototypes in San Diego—four made of concrete and four of “other materials.” The prototype will be 18- to 30-feet tall and be completed within 30 days. This move is just a small first step, since the Trump administration has about only $20 million to construct the prototypes, money repurposed from other accounts and far less than the estimated cost for building the entire wall, which could reach $50 billion. But it’s a sign that Trump has no intention of backing off his key campaign promise. September 30 – October 6 1. Treasury keeps one Obama-era tax rule—and targets many others In 2016, Barack Obama’s Treasury Department issued a rule to crack down on corporations that shift their headquarters overseas to avoid American taxes. The move provoked an outcry from Republicans who said Obama was unfairly punishing companies for Washington’s failure to reform the tax code—but it largely worked. The drugmaker Pfizer even abandoned a $160-billion acquisition that would have let it make the largest such shift ever. After Trump won the presidential election, many tax experts predicted he would roll back the rule—which specifically targeted corporate inversions, a kind of merger in which companies are “taken over” by smaller firms headquartered in low-tax countries like Ireland. But this week, Treasury announced that it wasn’t going to repeal the anti-inversion rule after all. With the administration still pushing hard for tax reform to lower corporate rates and bring company revenue back into the U.S., the agency said repealing the rule now “could make existing problems worse.” But the White House does plan to scrap a set of other Obama rules. The inversion news was just one part of an 11-page report issued by the agency recommending changes or rollbacks of a number of arcane Obama-era tax rules, many designed to crack down on tax avoidance schemes. Critics didn’t deny that such schemes existed but said the Obama administration’s solutions were vague and unworkable. For instance, one yet-to-be-finalized regulation, which Treasury now intends to withdraw, was intended to stop families from undervaluing their businesses to avoid the estate tax. Another rule relates to the definition of a political subdivision. The report itself does not actually change policy; Treasury will still have to go through a full rule-making process to modify or repeal any regulations. But it’s clear what direction Treasury intends to go. 2. DOJ revives a Bush-era approach to violent crime In 2001, the Department of Justice created a program to reduce gun violence by focusing resources on violent crime and forging better ties with local law enforcement. The program, known as Project Safe Neighborhoods, became a lower priority under Obama, as violent crime hit record lows and prosecutors focused on white-collar crime in the aftermath of the financial crisis. But on Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced he was reinvigorating Project Safe Neighborhood, requiring every U.S. Attorney to implement an “enhanced violent crime reduction program” and improve ties with local police. Sessions called Project Safe Neighborhoods, which was generally considered a success at reducing violent crime, the “centerpiece of our crime reduction strategy.” Critics previously said the program unfairly targeted poorer communities, leaving too many young African-Americans with long prison sentences or criminal records for minor crimes—although reaction this week to Sessions’ announcement was limited. 3. DOJ shifts its legal position on transgender discrimination In December 2014, Attorney General Eric Holder issued a memo ordering DOJ prosecutors to consider discrimination based on gender identity a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964—a huge victory for the LGBT community, especially transgender people. One critic at the time was Jeff Sessions, then a senator from Alabama. On Wednesday, Sessions reversed Holder’s memo. Holder had declared that sex discrimination—outlawed under the Civil Rights Act—should be construed to include gender-identity cases; Sessions walked that back with a memo stating that “sex discrimination encompasses discrimination between men and women but does not encompass discrimination based on gender identity per se, including transgender status.” In other words, the DOJ no longer considers discrimination against transgender people to violate the law. 4. FDA promises a new Nutrition Facts Panel—in 2020. Former first lady Michele Obama made healthy living her top priority, including creating the “Let’s Move” campaign to promote exercise. Perhaps no policy change was more important to her than the redesign of the Nutrition Facts Panel, the label you see on most food in stores, which she announced to great fanfare in May 2016. The label was to include information on “added sugars” for the first time, provoking a sharp response from the sugar industry. The Food and Drug Administration—the agency actually responsible for the redesign—set an initial date of July 26, 2018 for manufacturers to add the new label to food but new FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb indefinitely delayed the rule in June. This week, the agency finally revealed how long the delay will last: Another year and a half. The FDA published a rule in the Federal Register on Monday proposing to delay the compliance date until January 1,2020, an effort to give food companies more time. While the news is a logistical win for many food producers, the FDA has shown no signs of modifying the redesign. So while it will take longer to hit stores, the Obama-era Nutrition Facts Panel still appears to be coming. 5. Trump is renegotiating another trade agreement In recent months, Trump’s war of words with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has intensified and Pyongyang has conducted additional nuclear tests, raising fears of another war on the Korean Peninsula. For all those worries—and the supposed need to show a united front with our allies in the region—Trump hasn’t exactly played nice with South Korea. Instead, he has railed against South Korea’s trade policies—even threatening to withdraw from the U.S.-Korea free trade agreement—known as KORUS—if South Korea didn’t agree to renegotiate it. This week, Trump got his wish when the South Korean government announced it would seek to amend the 5-year-old pact. As with the ongoing renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the upcoming renegotiation of KORUS will be a technical process and take months, if not longer, to complete. In the meantime, the news is a victory for Trump—and an opportunity to draw closer to South Korea as North Korea’s nuclear program continues to advance. October 7 – 13 1. U.S. to withdraw from UNESCO During his presidential campaign, Trump railed against international institutions, like the United Nations and the World Trade Organization, raising fears that, as president, he would attempt to withdraw the U.S. from those organizations, dealing a decisive blow to the post-World War II international order. Despite continued threats and harsh rhetoric, he hasn’t done so—yet. But this week, the State Department did announce that the U.S. will withdraw from the U.N. agency charged with promoting educational, scientific and cultural collaboration, known as UNESCO, citing what it calls an anti-Israel bias. In 2011, UNESCO admitted Palestine as a member, forcing the Obama administration to cut all money for the agency under a little-known law prohibiting U.S. funding for any U.N. agency that accepts Palestine as a full member. (U.S. funds made up 22 percent of UNESCO’s budget.) The U.S. is now behind on about $550 million in payments, which the State Department said the Trump administration is unwilling to pay. The withdrawal won’t happen until the end of 2018, at which point the U.S. would become a nonmember observer state. The move isn’t exactly unprecedented—Ronald Reagan pulled the U.S. out of UNESCO in 1984 before the George W. Bush administration rejoined the agency in 2002—but it is still represents a shot across the U.N.’s bow as Trump pressures the organization on other reforms. 2. Education Department issues new priorities for federal grants Political leaders within federal agencies have a lot of levers to change policy, from issuing new regulations to changing enforcement priorities. But one underappreciated power is federal grant-making, funneling money to organizations that favor a certain policy agenda. On Thursday, the Education Secretary Betsy DeVos began to use this power when the Department of Education proposed new rules around federal grant programs, including a focus on the expansion of school choice—a top priority of DeVos. Organizations that favor school choice, along with other Trump administration priorities like the promotion of STEM and computer science, would receive extra points in the application process for competitive grants, replacing priorities under DeVos’s predecessor, John King, that focused on socioeconomic diversity in schools. The new priorities aren’t final; the agency is accepting comments on them for 30 days. But they show how DeVos intends to use all her authority to push forward her policy agenda. 3. Trump withdraws sanctions on Sudan During the Obama administration, the White House agreed to major foreign policy deals with two of the U.S.’s top adversaries, completing a nuclear deal with Iran and renewing diplomatic relations with Cuba. Trump has adamantly—and vocally—rejected that approach, rolling back pieces of Obama’s Cuba policy and, just today, decertifying the Iran nuclear agreement. Yet, for all his rhetoric about Obama’s “bad deals” and foolish foreign policy, Trump also made a move this week that looks very Obama-esque: lifting decades-old sanctions on Sudan that were imposed over Khartoum’s support of terrorist organizations, including al Qaeda. The State Department had announced a new strategy towards Sudan in the final days of the Obama administration, concluding that Sudan had made progress on counterterrorism efforts and on human rights issues. In something of a surprise, Trump has not reversed the policy, drawing praise from across the foreign policy establishment. The deal still drew criticism from some quarters, including from the families of terrorist victims who are owed compensation from attacks that courts have found were enabled by the Sudanese government. But the Trump administration may have had another reason to make the deal: Sudan said it would comply with U.N. sanctions on North Korea and not pursue arms deals with Pyongyang. 4. Energy Department releases rule to promote coal power plants In Trump’s continued campaign to undo Obama’s environmental legacy and revive the struggling coal industry, the headlines this week focused on the Environmental Protection Agency’s decision to repeal Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which imposed limits on greenhouse gas emissions. Less-noticed but nearly as important was a rule proposed by the Energy Department intended to improve the resiliency of the electricity grid by paying power plants that keep 90 days’ worth of fuel on site—a threshold only met by coal and nuclear plants. The move could significantly reform America’s energy markets but at 19-pages, the rule itself is sparse on details. Nevertheless, environmentalists slammed the move as a backdoor way for the department to subsidize coal and nuclear; even some free-market conservatives have criticized the changes, saying they would distort energy markets. But Energy Secretary Rick Perry isn’t backing down. The power to issue the rule actually falls to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, an independent agency that regulates America’s electricity markets. But Perry is using a provision in a law that hasn’t been used in 30 years to force FERC to take up the proposal and issue some type of decision on it within 60 days. In other words, big changes could be coming to America’s electricity market in just a few months. Stay tuned. 5. DOJ gives “last chance” to sanctuary cities In a week dominated by rolling back Obama’s top legacies and fulfilling Trump’s campaign promises, there was little news about the president’s immigration agenda. But at the Department of Justice, Attorney General Jeff Sessions continues to implement that agenda, despite continuing to find himself out of favor with Trump. This week, the DOJ sent notices to five so-called sanctuary jurisdictions—Cook County, Ill., Chicago, New York City, New Orleans and Philadelphia—that it said were required to comply with certain immigration rules as consequence of receiving a “Byrne JAG” grant, a DOJ grant program which provides money for state and local law enforcement. The DOJ didn't say that it would withhold grant money for the five jurisdictions if they don’t comply with the law. But the department has previously threatened to withhold “Byrne JAG” grants to cities that don’t meet certain conditions around immigration enforcement, although that policy is currently tied up in the courts. Given the sanctuary jurisdictions’ past refusal to change their policies in response to such DOJ threats, it’s likely that another court battle is coming soon. October 14 – 20 1. USDA withdraws a protection for small farmers It took years of pressure and a monologue from John Oliver, but on December 20 last year, the USDA’s Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration issued a final rule—known as the GIPSA rule—that would make it easier for small contract farmers, like chicken growers, to sue meat-packing or processing companies that engage in anticompetitive practices. The Obama administration’s move was a long-awaited victory for small farmers, who had been arguing for years that larger producers were dictating unfair prices to farmers and retaliating against them if they spoke out—and the bar for proving illegal activity was too high. But their win, it turns out, was short-lived: After delaying the rule’s effective date in February, the Trump administration announced this week that it will withdraw it altogether. GIPSA also abandoned a proposed rule, also issued last December, aimed at protecting chicken growers from unfair or predatory practices by large producers. Industry groups and many GOP lawmakers applauded the moves, arguing that the rules would have increased litigation costs and raised prices for consumers, while small farmer groups and Democrats slammed the changes. Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, was a rare GOP voice of dissent. “They’re just pandering to big corporations,” he said. 2. IRS ramps up enforcement of Obamacare Just hours after his inauguration, Trump signed a sweeping executive order directing federal agencies to provide Americans with “relief” from the Affordable Care Act. Though it wasn’t specific, many experts predicted he’d target the individual mandate—the part of the law, unpopular with conservatives, that penalizes people who don’t buy health insurance. So far, however, the administration has left the mandate alone—and this week the Internal Revenue Service took a step to strengthen it. The agency said that it will not accept 2017 tax returns that don‘t disclose the taxpayer’s health-insurance status or specify whether the taxpayer qualifies for an exemption. That disclosure is required under the ACA, but in the first two years since the mandate took effect, the IRS still processed tax returns that left the question blank, giving some Americans a backdoor way to evade the rule. Now, in something of a surprise, the IRS is closing that loophole. 3. Treasury declines to label China a currency manipulator—again In April, when the Treasury Department released its semi-annual report on foreign currency practices, its first under Trump, many experts were surprised that it did not officially label China a currency manipulator—a major, and very specific, promise Trump had made in his campaign. “Why would I call China a currency manipulator when they are working with us on the North Korean problem?” Trump tweeted in defense, a shockingly honest response about the political considerations involved in the currency label decision. In the six months since, the “North Korean problem” has only grown worse and China has proven reluctant to help, as Trump has said on Twitter. But when Treasury released its newest foreign currency report this week, it once again did not label China a currency manipulator. (In a typical White House, this wouldn’t be a surprise: China hasn’t pushed down its currency in recent years.) Elsewhere in the report, Treasury dropped Taiwan from its “currency watch list” and declined to add Thailand to the list, moves that both garnered criticism from some financial experts who said the countries have been interfering in foreign exchange markets. Taken together, the new report suggests that, at least on currency issues, Trump is adopting a conventional White House strategy, much like that of Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush. 4. A new pipeline gets the green light In October 2015, the Bureau of Land Management ruled that the Cadiz water pipeline, a plan to pump groundwater 43 miles from a desert aquifer to Southern California, would require the bureau’s authorization—a victory for environmentalists who argued that the project would deplete the important aquifer. But under Trump, BLM reversed its own finding, releasing a letter this week that said the pipeline no longer requires agency approval. BLM’s new finding represents the next step in the ongoing rollback of Obama’s environmental legacy, and the rise of a business-friendly agenda at departments that Obama had used to impose new restrictions on energy projects and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Cadiz pipeline may still require state approval, so construction won’t begin right away. But the BLM finding removes a major hurdle. 5. A setback for NAFTA renegotiations When Mexico, Canada and the United States began renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement in August, they pledged to complete the process before the end of the year—understanding that a deal would get only harder to reach during the 2018 Mexican presidential election. But this week, the three nations effectively gave up on that timeline," pushing back the next round of negotiations until late November over """"significant conceptual gaps among the parties", and admitting that the talks could stretch into 2018. The news wasn’t exactly surprising, given the increasingly rancorous talks among the three countries; the Trump administration has proposed a number of major NAFTA reforms, including a new sunset provision that would require the three countries to renew the agreement every five years, and the removal of a controversial protection for investors, both of which angered Canada and Mexico. But it still set off alarm bells in Washington and in boardrooms, where lawmakers and business executives are growing increasingly concerned that Trump will withdraw from the pact altogether. October 21 – 27 1. Trump opens the door to a drone zone As U.S. companies have raced to develop new, innovative uses for drones, they’ve faced tight rules in Washington as regulators attempt to understand the new technology and protect Americans from potential harm. To many private-sector companies, though, those rules have slowed a potentially productive industry and prevented America from becoming a leader in this technology. This week, Trump sided with the commercial companies when he sent a memo to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao directing her to create a pilot program within 90 days that would loosen rules around drone usage. Under the program, states could apply to the Federal Aviation Administration to create an “innovation zone” to experiment with different usages of drone technology, such as overnight package delivery, without having to comply with FAA regulations. An innovation zone could be as large as an entire state and would likely target three specific FAA restrictions on flying drones over people, at night and out of sight of the operator. 2. The Interior Department launches an offshore sale (and more) Under Barack Obama, the Interior Department protected huge swaths of federal land from oil and gas drilling, efforts that were praised by environmentalists and criticized by industry. But since Ryan Zinke rode into office in March, the department has reversed course—and, in three separate moves this week, Zinke made his biggest effort yet to unleash a new era of drilling. First, on Tuesday, Interior proposed its biggest offshore oil and gas lease sale in its history, putting 77 million acres—an area the size of New Mexico—up for sale. The sale will occur next March and includes all available, unleased areas in the Gulf of Mexico. Then, on Wednesday, Interior’s Bureau of Land Management rescinded an Obama-era memo that directed officials to consider climate change and greenhouse gas emissions before approving any energy projects. Finally, on Thursday, BLM issued a notice that it will offer all available oil and gas leases in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve in December, potentially opening up more than 10 million acres of land to drilling. Taken together, the three moves represent a major effort to roll back Obama-era environmental restrictions and ramp up drilling, infuriating environmentalists and pleasing the oil and gas industry. But with the price of oil around $50 per barrel, it’s not clear whether Interior will find buyers for all the new leases. As much as Zinke may want to encourage new drilling, simple economics may block his plans for now. 3. With silence from D.C., Iowa withdraws its Obamacare waiver States worried about the health of their Obamacare insurance markets have been turning to a little-known section of the Affordable Care Act that allows them to opt out of many ACA regulations. A so-called Section 1332 innovation waiver grants states additional flexibility in their insurance markets, as long as they stay within the basic parameters of the law, and get approval from Washington. The most controversial proposal was Iowa’s, filed in June, which would have overhauled its individual insurance market by creating an entirely new Obamacare subsidy structure, providing larger subsidies to middle-income people and smaller ones to the poor. It was seen as a very conservative plan, though many experts said it would undermine the ACA’s protections for low-income people and thus violate the waiver requirements. Trump health officials had taken more than two months to respond to the waiver, and on Monday, Iowa withdrew it entirely. In one sense, this wasn’t a surprise since Trump had reportedly directed the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to reject Iowa’s application. But there were also signs that CMS wanted to approve the waiver but couldn’t find a way to do so legally. For instance, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and CMS Administrator Seema Verma issued a joint statement on the news, saying “Iowa pursued state flexibility through the Stopgap Measure, but ultimately, Obamacare is an inflexible law that Congress must repeal and replace.” The withdrawal was huge news in the health world, where insurers and state policymakers had been wondering just how far Trump would go in using waivers to undermine the ACA. Now his administration seems to have drawn a line. 4. The U.S. trade office cracks down on developing countries As Trump has threatened to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement and sparred with China, South Korea and Germany over their trade policies, he’s largely left developing countries alone. Those countries, though, receive major trade advantages with the U.S., which waives duties on thousands of products as a way to encourage their economic growth. This week, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative announced that it will crack down on countries that take advantage of those preferences, creating a new process to review whether countries actually qualify for tariff cuts. Right now, 120 countries meet the eligibility criteria to export products duty-free into the U.S., but the Trump administration worries that the program has been abused, allowing countries to receive tariff cuts even though they aren’t meeting their own obligations under the eligibility criteria, such as combating child labor or upholding worker rights. The new effort is an attempt to stop any such abuse. 5. The FCC helps out a conservative broadcaster For decades, the Federal Communications Commission has required TV stations to maintain a “main studio” near the communities they serve, an effort to prevent big, national broadcasters from buying up local stations and moving their production to big cities like New York. But the rule has faced criticism from some networks and Republicans as being outdated in the internet age, when people can contact local networks on social media or through email, instead of visiting them in person. This week, under the direction of Chairman Ajit Pai, the FCC sided with the critics, revoking the “main studio” rule on a party-line vote. Pai argued that eliminating the rule would allow broadcasters to focus more resources on local coverage. But many Democrats and even some Republicans see an ulterior motive: Paving the way for Sinclair Broadcast Group, the controversial conservative broadcaster that is currently seeking government approval for its $3.9 billion merger with Tribune Media, to gain an even larger foothold in local markets. The repeal of the “main studio” rule follows an earlier party-line FCC vote to ease restrictions on national television ownership. To Pai and his supporters, the moves are a long overdue change to an outdated regulatory system around broadcast television. But to his critics, it’s a not-so-veiled attempt to help Sinclair expand its conservative television empire. This fight isn’t ending anytime soon. October 28 – November 3 1. The Labor Department might be issuing a new overtime rule When the Department of Labor announced in September that it would not appeal a federal ruling striking down former President Barack Obama’s rule that was designed to make millions more workers eligible for mandatory overtime pay, it didn’t come as much of a surprise. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta had previously signaled that he opposed the rule, and to most observers, the rule was dead. But this week, in what looked like a surprise reversal, the Labor Department appealed the judge’s ruling. In fact, as a DOL official told The Wall Street Journal, the Trump administration isn’t defending the Obama-era rule; instead, it’s defending the department’s authority to issue an overtime rule altogether, which the federal ruling had called into question. By appealing the case, the Labor Department is signaling that it’s serious about issuing a new overtime rule, a process that it began in July. In other words, Obama’s overtime rule isn’t coming back to life. But a new overtime rule—almost certainly with a lower salary threshold than DOL proposed under Obama—might be coming. 2. State Department releases overdue guidance on Russian sanctions In August, faced with the threat of a veto override, Trump reluctantly signed a bill imposing sanctions on Russia for its meddling in the 2016 presidential election. But as of Oct. 1, the Trump administration blew through the bill’s deadline to identify which Russian entities would actually face sanctions, raising concerns about whether, instead of vetoing the bill, Trump was just ignoring it altogether. But with two recent actions, the State Department put some of those concerns to rest. Last Friday, nearly a month late, the department released a list of more than three dozen Russian entities that will be sanctioned under the bill. And this week, it released two guidance documents about how State will enforce sanctions to Russia’s energy sector. The moves are certain not to ease congressional concerns that the Trump administration, and the president himself in particular, will go too easy on Moscow and still don’t fully appreciate Russia’s role in the 2016 election. But State is at least implementing the sanctions legislation. 3. The Trump administration approves Utah’s Medicaid waiver In July 2016, Utah submitted a waiver to the Obama administration to expand its Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act. But it came with a catch: Tight eligibility restrictions. The Utah plan would offer Medicaid coverage to certain people earning up to 105 percent of the federal poverty line, instead of 138 percent as envisioned under Obamacare. Utah later added work requirements and a time limit on coverage to its waiver proposal. While the Obama administration approved Medicaid waivers in some states, it never responded to Utah’s proposal. But this week, the Trump administration gave Utah and its Republican governor, Gary Herbert, the green light on a revised plan that will provide coverage to up to 6,000 of the neediest low-income adults—those chronically homeless or suffering from substance abuse issues—in the state. The federal government will provide 70 percent of the money, equal to the matching rate under the traditional Medicaid program in Utah but below the rate set by Obamacare for the expansion populations. The plan doesn’t include a work requirement or a time limit on coverage. Many Democrats and liberal health experts have been concerned that the Trump administration would grant waivers to states to impose new eligibility restrictions on Medicaid, including work requirements, while conservatives have been excited about the opportunity to test different Medicaid reforms in the states. The approval of the Utah waiver signals those liberal fears and conservative excitement may become a reality. 4. A trade war with Canada? Perhaps the most surprising piece of Trump’s trade agenda during his first year in office has nothing to do with China or the North American Free Trade Agreement. It’s that he has targeted Canada with a series of trade sanctions, including imposing preliminary duties on Canada’s softwood lumber in April and June. In September, the countries appeared to have a chance at avoiding a messy trade fight when the Commerce Department delayed those duties as the two sides tried to negotiate a settlement. But this week, any hopes of an agreement were dashed when Commerce imposed final duties on certain Canadian softwood lumber products. Under U.S. trade law, those duties aren’t actually locked in yet; the International Trade Commission, an independent agency, must make a final determination by mid-December on whether U.S. lumber producers are being harmed by Canadian imports. The countries, in the past, have generally managed to settle the decades-long dispute through negotiations, without resorting to trade sanctions. So, Commerce’s announcement this week represents an escalation of a fight with Canada that threatens to undermine trade relations between the two allies as they continue the contentious NAFTA renegotiations. Canada sharply criticized the U.S. move and threatened to take legal action under NAFTA or World Trade Organization rules. A fight that has been simmering for years has finally burst into flames—and may get even hotter in the months ahead. 5. EPA bans certain scientists from its advisory boards Within the Environmental Protection Agency are a few important science boards that evaluate research used by the agency in rule-makings and that recommend certain science-based environmental standards, including on air pollution. While little known to the public, the boards act as something of a scientific backstop to an agency that often is involved in politically contentious fights. This week, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt announced a major reform of those advisory boards when he banned researchers who receive an EPA grant from sitting on them. Critics called the move a purge that would allow Pruitt to stack the boards with business-friendly scientists who would shift the recommendations of the boards and give the agency scientific backing to adopt less stringent environmental standards. Pruitt and his allies responded that the move is needed to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure that the board members are independent. The change won’t affect that many members of each board, perhaps five out of 47 on the EPA’s Science Advisory Board, for instance, who “will have to choose either the grant or service,” according to Pruitt. It’s the latest in a long list of moves by Pruitt to roll back Obama’s environmental legacy and impose a new, conservative approach at the agency. November 4 – 10 1. Big changes coming for Medicaid Buried in almost every version of the Republican health care legislation this year was a little provision that would have enabled states to make a major change to their Medicaid programs, by requiring people to work if they’re going to get coverage. When those bills died, it appeared that Medicaid work requirements died with them. But this week, Seema Verma, the head of the Centers for Medicaid &amp; Medicare Services and a longtime supporter of work requirements, sent a strong message that work requirements are back on the table. In a speech to the country’s Medicaid directors, Verma lambasted the Obama administration’s approach to Medicaid, calling it a “tragic example of the soft bigotry of low expectations,” and argued that requiring Medicaid beneficiaries to work would improve the program. The speech doesn’t result in any immediate policy changes, but CMS is reviewing at least seven waiver proposals from GOP-led states that would impose work requirements on their Medicaid populations. The details around each waiver vary and it’s unclear whether Verma, who helped design a work requirement policy in Indiana that was rejected by the Obama administration, will ask states to tweak their submissions or when she will approve the first waiver. But her speech this week was a clear sign that big changes are coming to Medicaid — even without any help from Congress. 2. USDA delays organic livestock welfare rule The day before Obama left office, the Department of Agriculture made one last attempt to improve conditions for organically raised animals, publishing new requirements on everything from that ensuring animals have daily access to the outdoors to acceptable euthanasia methods to bedding material during transport. Conservation groups, animal welfare groups and many organic farmers cheered the news and USDA officials made a public case for the rule. But this week, those arguments came up short when the agency announced that it was delaying the rule until May 2018—the third delay since Trump took office—and said it found both legal and policy issues with the Obama-era rule, including errors in USDA’s original cost-benefit analysis of it. The move is a victory for many large egg producers, who had sharply criticized the rule as unnecessary and argued that it would raise costs for consumers. But it’s also likely to disappoint a lot of people: The USDA also revealed that the vast majority of the 47,000 commenters on the proposed delay supported the rule. Just a few dozen wanted it withdrawn or suspended. And just a single person supported delaying the rule — the action ultimately chosen by the agency. 3. New Cuba sanctions In June, Trump appeared before cheering supporters in Miami to announce a rollback of Obama’s opening to Cuba, saying that he was “canceling” the “one-sided” deal, imposing new travel restrictions on Americans visiting the island and cutting off transactions with companies connected to Cuba’s military, security and intelligence services. But for months afterward, the agencies responsible for implementing Trump’s directive — the Treasury, Commerce and State departments — were quiet. Finally, on Wednesday, the agencies released rules announcing the policy changes. Americans can no longer visit Cuba individually for educational purposes — tourism is banned by law — and instead can do so only as part of a licensed group. The State Department also released a list of roughly 180 Cuban entities with which Americans and U.S. companies cannot conduct direct financial transactions, including multiple Cuban drink companies that trade experts said would be nearly impossible to enforce. Contracts signed before Thursday, when the new sanctions took effect, were grandfathered in, so hotel chains like Marriott won’t have to withdraw from agreements with entities on the State Department list. Supporters of the Obama-era Cuba policy lambasted the move, saying it would set back efforts to open Cuba’s economy and political system, and they said Trump was hypocritical to issue the changes during a trip in which he was visiting two Communist countries, China and Vietnam. But the new rule also provoked sharp words from the two biggest Cuba hawks in Congress, Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart who were both at Trump’s June speech. In separate statements, Rubio and Diaz-Balart both criticized bureaucrats for watering down Trump’s directive and said they expected the three agencies to reform the new rules. A State Department official defended the rule in a statement, saying the agency “examined a range of sources” in compiling the list — but also said that the agency will review the list periodically and potentially add new entities to it. 4. DHS ends protected immigration status for Nicaraguans, extends it for Hondurans Trump’s immigration crackdown has largely focused on undocumented immigrants, including the so-called Dreamers who were effectively protected from deportation during the final years of the Obama administration. But Trump also has some levers of power over immigrants residing in the country legally — but, as a big move this week showed, using those powers can prove complicated. On Tuesday night, the Department of Homeland Security announced that it was ending a special immigration status for 5,300 Nicaraguans, giving them until January 2019 to leave the United States. But the agency also announced it was extending the protected status of 86,000 Hondurans for six months. Temporary Protected Status, as it is officially known, allows foreign nationals whose home country is hit by a war or natural disaster to temporarily live and work in the U.S. The Trump administration has argued that the TPS program has been abused and promised to crack down on it. The highly watched move drew a sharp rebuke from Democrats, who said many of the Nicaraguans had lived and worked in the U.S. for decades and deserve to stay here. It also appeared to draw an opposite rebuke from White House chief of staff John Kelly, who reportedly called DHS Acting Secretary Elaine Duke to ask her to revoke TPS for the Hondurans as well. Duke angrily rejected Kelly’s request, and the episode quickly leaked to multiple news agencies, an inside look at the complications the White House faces implementing its immigration crackdown. 5. USDA withdraws Obama-era rule on genetically engineered products On Sept. 16 of last year, the Obama administration released a new, far-reaching framework to clarify the regulatory roles of the three agencies overseeing biotechnology products, from chemicals to pharmaceuticals, the first comprehensive update in almost 30 years. Currently USDA, FDA, and EPA share responsibilities for overseeing biotech products, which have gone from a scientific novelty to a multibillion-dollar industry since the rules were introduced in the 1980s. As part of the new framework, USDA released a 32-page rule on the day before Obama left office, creating new restrictions around biotech products, including genetically engineered crops. The ideas was to streamline the regulatory process and ensure that genetically engineered products did not pose a risk to consumers. But industry groups protested the new framework, arguing that the rules contradicted one another and imposed unnecessary costs on companies. On Tuesday, the USDA officially reversed course and withdrew the rule. Secretary Sonny Perdue argued that the Obama-era plan imposed unnecessary costs on the industry and would restrict innovation, and promised to work with stakeholders to develop a new rule. It’s just the latest regulatory rollback in the Trump era. November 11 – 17 1. DOJ takes another shot at sanctuary cities During the presidential campaign, Trump frequently promised to crack down on so-called “sanctuary cities,” threatening to withhold federal money unless they help the federal government enforce the country’s immigration laws. And he chose one of the country’s top critics of sanctuary cities as his attorney general, former Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions. But as Sessions and Trump have attempted to actually crack down on such sanctuary jurisdictions, they’ve run into real limits on their power. This week, Sessions issued his latest threats to withhold federal policing grants from 29 jurisdictions that may not be complying with certain immigration laws. The DOJ told the jurisdictions to address any violations by Dec. 8. The move is the latest threat from Sessions to withhold funding, following up on letters he sent to five sanctuary cities in October that gave them their “last chance” to comply with federal immigration laws. In July, Sessions issued a new policy in which a valuable federal grant to cities, the largest for local police departments at $347 million last year, would be conditional on cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. So far, though, Trump and Sessions don’t appear to have actually withheld any funding from sanctuary jurisdictions since taking office. In part, that’s because Trump’s presidency is less than a year old and it takes time to implement such a policy. But the DOJ has also faced pushback from the courts, which have issued injunctions in multiple jurisdictions to block these anti-sanctuary city policies. Trump’s campaign promise on sanctuary cities was popular with his base, but it is proving much tougher to implement. 2. Game on for elephant poaching In June 2016, the Fish and Wildlife Service announced a near universal ban on the commercial sale of elephant ivory in the United States, an effort to crack down on wildlife trafficking in African countries such as Zimbabwe, Botswana and South Africa. Conservationists cheered the news, while hunting advocacy groups argued that the move would backfire by forcing the trade underground. On Thursday, the Trump administration sided with the hunters when the Fish and Wildlife Service announced it was reversing the Obama-era policy and would allow the import of elephant ivory that was hunted for sport in Zimbabwe or Zambia between Jan. 21, 2016 and the end of next year. The Service argued that Zimbabwe has “stepped up its anti-poaching efforts” and that allowing some commercial trade in sport-hunted ivory in the U.S. could actually support the African elephant population by providing a revenue stream for Zimbabwean conservation efforts. The lifting of the ban also applies to Zambia, although the Federal Register notice does not mention the country. Environmentalists immediately slammed the news and said it would jeopardize the African elephant populations, while hunting groups praised what they said was an overdue reversal of a misguided Obama-era policy. There might be some cheering coming from the Trump family as well: Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump are both big-game hunters. 3. FCC overhauls the Lifeline program The bogus claim that former President Barack Obama was giving out free cellphones to the poor — derisively called “Obamaphones” in conservative media — was one of the most persistent fake-news stories of his presidency. The story was a distortion of the Lifeline program, which subsidizes phone and broadband service, and the person who expanded it from landlines to cell carriers was President George W. Bush. Lifeline’s budget did grow under Obama, nearly tripling from 2008 to 2012; last year, it cost $1.5 billion and served 12.3 million people. Critics have said the program has been abused, and this week, the Federal Communications Commission under Chairman Ajit Pai passed major reforms attempting to reduce such fraud and waste. Notably, the plan eliminates funding for wireless re-sellers, which purchase services from a telecom company and then resell that service to consumers. Many consumer advocates were sharply critical of the plan, saying that previous reforms had already reduced fraud in the program, and that Pai’s changes would cut off phone service to millions of low-income households, many of whom use wireless re-sellers. The Lifeline reforms is just the latest effort by Pai to roll back Obama-era policies at the FCC, and it won’t be the last: News leaked this week that the FCC is preparing to issue its final order that repeals Obama’s net neutrality rules. Stay tuned. 4. Another (possible) win for hunters In October 2015, the National Park Service issued a new rule on hunting across 20 million acres of national reserves in Alaska, an effort to preserve wildlife in the state. The rules touched on everything from when wolves and coyotes can be hunted — not during the denning season — to a prohibition on hunting big game that is swimming. The rule, which attracted more than 70,000 comments during the proposal stage, was a victory for conservationists and a defeat for many hunters, as well as the state of Alaska which argued that the NPS was overstepping its bounds and overriding state law. This week, the NPS announced that it is initiating a review of the rule with the priority of complying with a directive from Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke “to advance conservation stewardship and increase outdoor recreation opportunities, including hunting and fishing, for all Americans.” There’s no timetable for when NPS could issue a new rule or what it could look like. But it’s another sign that Zinke is imposing a new conservative agenda at Interior. 5. EPA delays WOTUS In early 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency issued the Waters of the United States rule — known as WOTUS — a far-reaching and long-awaited plan to limit pollution on America’s wetlands. WOTUS was hailed by environmentalists but loathed by conservatives who said it would impose huge, unnecessary costs on companies and in June, EPA issued a proposed rule to repeal WOTUS. In other words, WOTUS is all but dead. But in the next few weeks, the Supreme Court could issue a jurisdictional ruling that could lead to an injunction being lifted on the rule in 37 states, forcing those states to comply with WOTUS even though EPA is certain to issue a final order repealing the rule in the next few months. Faced with that possibility, EPA announced this week that it would delay the effective date of WOTUS for two years, effectively an insurance policy against an adverse Supreme Court ruling. And EPA must be concerned about that possibility: The agency is giving the public just 21 days to comment on the rule, less than the customary 30-day period. November 25 – December 1 1. Stockbrokers can breathe easier One of Obama’s last, and most controversial rules was the 2016 “fiduciary standard,” designed to prevent stockbrokers from putting their interests ahead of those of their clients. This was fiercely opposed by the financial industry, and in the Trump era, it’s been the subject of some confusing back-and-forth. In May, Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta announced that he would allow part of the rule to take effect in early June—which cheered liberals—but announced not long afterward that he wasn’t going to actually enforce those pieces of the rule until January 1, 2018. Then, at the end of August, the DOL proposed delaying key parts of the rule until well into 2019, which would give the department time to rewrite the policy altogether. This week, the DOL under Acosta made that 18-month delay official. The Labor Department calls it a transition period, during which stockbrokers must comply with a looser set of “impartial conduct standards”—but the agency also said it would not enforce even those standards against any entity that was working in “good faith” to comply. 2. Commerce makes two trade moves against China Trump spent much of his presidential campaign bashing China’s trade practices and raising fears about an impending trade war with America’s biggest trading partner. But in office, he has surprisingly targeted Canada instead, imposing new duties on Canadian lumber and taking a hard line over NAFTA renegotiations. Now there are signs that the Trump administration is starting to take a tougher line on Chinese trade. On Tuesday, the Commerce Department opened an anti-dumping case into Chinese aluminum. The opening of such a case is generally unremarkable—but unlike every case for the past 25 years, it wasn’t triggered by a request from a company or industry group. Instead, it was “self-initiated.” Also on Tuesday, the administration imposed new duties on Chinese tool chests and cabinets. Neither of these moves will cause major changes in the U.S.-China trade relationship. But they are a signal that the relationship, which began with a small 10-point trade agreement in May, is becoming more hostile. 3. USDA rolls back Michelle Obama’s school lunch rules In 2012, the Department of Agriculture issued a sweeping rewrite of the rules around school lunches, an effort to get kids to eat more fruit and vegetables and reduce their intake of sodium and fat. The controversial overhaul was a linchpin of former first lady Michelle Obama’s healthy living campaign, but was panned by some schools and Republican lawmakers who said it didn’t give the schools the flexibility to provide students with food that they would actually eat. Now, schools may never have to comply with key pieces of the rule. On Wednesday, the USDA delayed the new sodium standards by “at least” three years and indicated that the agency may rewrite the standard altogether. It also granted schools additional flexibility to meet the whole grain standards and allowed schools to serve flavored milk, including chocolate milk, which the Obama-era rule didn’t allow. The changes weren’t exactly a surprise, as Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, in one of his first speeches in office, announced his intent to roll back the school lunch rules. But they are a clear message that a new conservative era is underway at USDA. 4. Old bombs are back in action In 2008, the Department of Defense under Secretary Robert Gates announced that the United States would phase out the use of its older stock of cluster bombs by 2019. Human rights groups oppose the use of cluster bombs because they explode indiscriminately over large areas, risking the lives of many civilians, and more than 100 countries have called for a ban on the weapon. Under the new policy, the U.S. would only use modern cluster munitions that explode at least 99 percent of the time, or had safeguards in place if they didn’t explode, so that dangerous, unexploded cluster bombs could not kill civilians years or decades after they were initially dropped. But as the deadline for meeting that policy approaches, the Pentagon this week revealed that it is reversing course. Multiple news organizations reported that a memo from Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan said the military will continue to use the older stock of cluster munitions “until the capabilities they provide are replaced with enhanced and more reliable munitions.” The Pentagon later confirmed that the agency was reversing the 2008 policy. Human rights groups and Democrats, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, slammed the move, saying that it was past due for the U.S. to stop using the older cluster bombs. 5. State Department extends extreme vetting The Trump administration has faced many setbacks as it tried to implement an executive order to block or inhibit people from six Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. But on Trump’s promise to impose so-called extreme vetting on people entering the country, he’s had much more success after the State Department implemented new questions for visa applicants on an emergency basis earlier this year. On Monday, State issued a notice asking for comment on a proposal to extend this extreme vetting for three years. The new proposal would not make any substantive changes to the emergency measures implemented in May, including questions on visa applicants’ social media accounts. The public has 30 days to comment on the proposal. December 2 – 8 1. DOL rolls back Obama-era rule on tipped wages In 2011, Obama’s Department of Labor issued a new rule to protect workers who rely heavily on tips: It prohibited companies from pooling the tips of their workers and dispersing them to other staff. The idea was to prevent employers from pocketing the tips themselves, but critics said it created a gap between tipped and nontipped workers. This week, the Trump administration issued a rule to repeal pieces of the 2011 rule, allowing tip pooling among workers who make at least the minimum wage, which the DOL says will allow employers to more fairly treat tipped and nontipped workers. Workers who make the special sub-minimum wage for tipped employees would still be protected. Labor advocates were very critical of the proposed rollback, saying it would effectively sanction wage theft, allowing employers to collect tips that are rightfully owed to tipped workers. The plan so far is just a proposal; the public has 30 days to comment on it. 2. DOJ starts the process to—maybe—regulate bump stocks After a gunman killed 58 people in Las Vegas in October, Democrats and Republicans appeared to be nearing an agreement on a ban on “bump stocks,” a gun modification that enables rapid-fire shooting, and which was used by the Vegas shooter to turn his rifles into something close to an automatic weapon. Many lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agreed that the devices should be illegal, but talks broke down after Republicans said that a new law wasn’t needed because the Department of Justice could just reinterpret the existing ban on the possession of machine guns to include bump stocks. This week, the DOJ took the first step in that process, announcing that it has drafted an “advanced notice of proposed rulemaking” to give the public and industry an opportunity to comment on a potential new interpretation of the underlying law. “Today we begin the process of determining whether or not bump stocks are covered by this prohibition,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. Democrats were sharply critical of the announcement, saying that it was simply a delaying tactic and that the DOJ doesn’t have the authority to ban bump stocks. “Legislation is the only answer and Congress should not attempt to pass the buck by waiting for the ATF,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein. More than two months after the Las Vegas shooting, the sides remain no closer to agreement. 3. U.S. ends participation in global compact on migration Faced with rising numbers of migrants across the globe, from Syrians fleeing civil war to Europe to Guatemalan children entering the United States, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution in September 2016 that would create a new global compact on migration, promising to stop gender-based violence and improve educational opportunities for migrants, among other commitments. Human rights groups hailed the agreement, set to be formally adopted in 2018, as a promising effort to find a humane and fair way for countries to deal with the rising flow of refugees. But on Sunday, the United States withdrew from the compact, saying that it infringed on U.S. sovereignty. Trump officials defended the withdrawal as necessary to protect America’s borders. “We simply cannot in good faith support a process that could undermine the sovereign right of the United States to enforce our immigration laws and secure our borders,” said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. But diplomats and human rights groups slammed the move, saying it represented an abdication of the U.S.’ international responsibilities that would further degrade its global standing. 4. USDA signals major policy shift on food stamps Should food stamp recipients be required to pass a drug test to receive their benefits? Under Obama, Republican states repeatedly requested permission to impose stricter eligibility requirements on food stamp recipients, which they said would help increase self-sufficiency and improve the integrity of the program. Those proposals were rejected by the Department of Agriculture, which said requirements like drug testing wouldn’t help recipients get back to work. But with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue now in office, those proposals are set to receive a much warmer hearing. This week, USDA released a two-page letter —dated Nov. 30—that informed state commissioners that it “will allow greater state flexibility” in their food stamp programs. The letter pinpointed three specific areas—self-sufficiency, integrity and customer service—where the agency will likely be receptive to state-level experimentation, an indication to many experts that previously rejected GOP proposals will now be approved. In fact, this week, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker announced that he has submitted to USDA a proposal to drug test food stamp recipients. The exact policy implications of the vaguely worded letter are unclear. “You can expect more communication soon on policy that shifts our focus toward these three critical areas,” the letter read, referring to the three new USDA priorities. But it’s clear that a new era of conservative policy in the food stamps program has arrived. 5. BLM finalizes delay on methane waste rule In November 2016, shortly after Trump’s election, the Bureau of Land Management issued a rule to regulate methane leaks from new oil and gas wells, tightening up the requirements on companies operating on public lands. It was one of the Obama administration’s final efforts to combat climate change but it was hated by industry groups who said it was unnecessarily burdensome: companies already have an incentive to reduce methane leaks, they argued, because leaking gas hurts their bottom lines. The rule took effect on Jan. 17, just before Trump’s inauguration, giving environmentalists hope that it wouldn’t be rolled back. Those hopes were short-lived. This week, BLM delayed until Jan. 17,2019, major pieces of the Obama-era regulation, effectively negating the rule and giving the agency time to repeal or rewrite it altogether. The delay wasn’t exactly a surprise: In June, the Trump administration attempted to delay key compliance dates for the Obama-era rule, effectively pushing back when companies must actually adjust their operational practices to avoid penalties, but a judge ruled in October that BLM’s delay violated procedural rules. The new delay, issued after a full rule-making process, is likely on sounder procedural ground. December 9 – 15 1. NLRB reverses course on multiple Obama-era rulings Who is your real employer? The question is increasingly important as more and more Americans have jobs as contractors or through staffing agencies. In 2015, in a highly watched decision, the National Labor Relations Board—with a Democratic majority—ruled that Browning-Ferris Industries was jointly liable for labor violations committed by a staffing firm it hired to supply employees. The decision effectively expanded the definition of “joint employment,” so that more companies would be liable for infractions committed by their franchisees or contractors. Labor advocates lauded the ruling, saying it was necessary to uphold workers’ collective bargaining rights as the number of workers in temporary or contractual work rises. But those cheers were short-lived. This week, the NLRB—now with a GOP majority— overturned the Browning-Ferris decision, saying that it violated the National Labor Relations Act and was “ill-advised as a matter of policy.” Instead, it reinstated the previous standard, which makes it harder for workers to challenge companies for their contractors or franchisees’ NLRA violations. The NLRB also took the first step in overturning its 2014 ruling that allowed unions to speed up elections, which unions said were necessary to prevent common stall tactics from companies. Businesses argued that the 2014 rule prevented them from adequately preparing for the elections. In the new, conservative era at the NLRB, businesses are finding a much more welcome reception. 2. White House releases its new regulatory blueprint Twice a year, the White House releases a major report on its regulatory plans, complete with a detailed breakdown for each agency, from major ones like the Department of Labor to obscure ones like the American Battle Monuments Commission, and its scheduled rulemakings. This so-called Unified Agenda is highly anticipated by businesses, lawmakers and lobbyists. On Thursday, the White House released its second Unified Agenda —the first was released in July—but it was the first that included new Trump-era features on so-called deregulatory actions, which are any regulatory action taken by an agency that reduces economic costs. Experts are still looking through the document, attempting to discern any changes from the July version, and digging into how Trump intends to overhaul the government’s regulatory apparatus. As has been clear for a while, Trump’s main regulatory priority is to roll back the regulatory state. The White House claimed Thursday that the administration had cut 22 regulations for each new one it issued, and claimed $570 million in annual economic savings this year. Those numbers are exaggerated, since they include every deregulatory action while only including regulations with costs greater than $100 million—and nearly 75 percent of the $570 million in cost savings comes from the repeal of one rule. But the Unified Agenda shows that the administration plans to target a wide era of Obama-era rules and implement other Trump administration priorities. A few examples: The Department of Education plans to issue new proposals to replace two Obama-era rules that were intended to protect students from predatory for-profit colleges. Those proposed rules are scheduled to be issued in May and June 2018. The Department of Transportation will focus its rulemaking on drones, which are likely to loosen restrictions on operators, while the Department of Labor intends to issue rules to reform the H1-B visa program for skilled workers to focus on the “best and brightest” and to prevent the spouses of H1-B visa holders from receiving work permits. But it wasn’t all good news for the deregulatory crowd: The Environmental Protection Agency’s plan to repeal a far-reaching Obama-era rule intended to limit pollution in America’s wetlands is delayed. In July, the agency said it would issue a proposed rule this month. That has now been delayed to next May. A final rule isn’t expected until June 2019. 3. Department of Transportation kills Obama-era rule on airline fees Just 11 days before Trump took office, the Department of Transportation proposed a rule to force airlines to disclose checked and carry-on baggage fees when passengers first begin to purchase a ticket, rather than later during the process. While airlines are required to disclose those fees, consumer groups argued that they are often hidden late in the process. The Obama-era proposal, they said, would increase transparency and improve market competition. But this week, the Department of Transportation officially withdrew the proposed rule, saying it was of “limited public benefit” and that the Department’s existing rules were adequate to protect consumers from hidden fees. Consumer groups and Democrats slammed the move while airlines groups praised the withdrawal, saying the Obama-era rule was an unfair restriction on airlines’ rights to market and sell their product as they see fit. 4. FCC makes big moves—beyond net neutrality The Federal Communication Commission’s decision on Thursday to overturn Obama-era rules on net neutrality dominated the headlines, provoking a sharp backlash from liberal groups who said that the rollback would threaten the free and open Internet. Conservatives praised the move, arguing that liberal fears were vastly overblown and that it will encourage digital innovation. But beyond net neutrality, the FCC also made a couple other key decisions on Thursday. Most notably, the FCC issued a “notice of proposed rulemaking” on changing or killing a cap on media ownership, which currently prevents broadcasters from reaching more than 39 percent of the national audience. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the agency has no specific plans for reforming the cap, saying, “We are just asking.” But many groups are skeptical of Pai’s intentions after he reinstated a policy earlier this year, known as the UHF discount, that critics say was designed to enable the conservative broadcaster Sinclair Broadcast Group to purchase to purchase Tribune Media without violating the 39 percent cap. Pai says the UHF discount and the media ownership cap are “inextricably linked” and the FCC intends to review them together. The FCC also voted to create a new “blue alert” code—to go along with existing alerts including for missing children (AMBER alert) and severe weather—for when a law enforcement officer is killed or in trouble. This change was less controversial: It passed unanimously. 5. USDA begins repeal of organic livestock welfare rule On January 19, just a day before Trump took office, the Department of Agriculture published a new rule intending to improve conditions for organically raised animals on everything from daily access to the outdoors to acceptable euthanasia methods. Animal welfare groups and many organic farmers cheered the news, while large egg producers and other big agricultural companies said it would raise prices for consumers. This week, USDA took the first step toward overturning the Obama-era rule, issuing a proposed rule to repeal it altogether. The move wasn’t exactly a surprise: USDA had already sharply criticized the rule as having both legal and policy issues and had delayed its effective date three times. It’s currently not set to take effect until May 2018. Now, that almost certainly that will not happen. December 16 – 22 1. HUD abandons Obama-era rules on floods In October 2016, the Department of Housing and Urban Development took a major step to address the risks of climate change on the housing market with a new proposed rule that required that any building in a flood plain even partly financed by HUD to be built on higher ground. The rule was in response to an executive order from President Barack Obama requiring HUD to issue rules so that federally owned or managed buildings could better withstand severe storms. But this week, HUD reversed course. It officially withdrew the Obama-era rule, citing Trump’s executive orders requiring agencies to review and repeal costly regulations. The news is a setback for environmentalists and a victory for homebuilding companies, which said the Obama-era rule would raise prices and hurt low-income homeowners and renters. HUD also withdrew four other proposed rules issued during the Obama era, including one on demolishing public buildings. 2. The trade war with Canada continues During the first 11 months of Trump’s presidency, trade relations between the United States and Canada have been surprisingly hostile. The two sides have clashed over renegotiation the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the U.S. has issued trade sanctions on Canadian lumber. And there are no signs that the relationship is going to improve. One big flash point has been costly new duties levied against planes made by the Canadian aircraft-maker Bombardier, which Boeing has accused of unfairly benefiting from government subsidies in a $5.6 billion deal last year to sell regional jets to Delta. Since the Commerce Department proposed roughly 300 percent duties in September, Canadian and European leaders have spent the past few months heavily lobbying against them. This week, the agency announced its final figure: 292 percent, slightly reduced but still a giant amount. Bombardier has a chance to derail the trade sanctions: The International Trade Commission, an independent agency, must rule in early 2018 whether its practices actually harmed any U.S. manufacturer. (If not, Commerce said, the duties would be terminated.) In the meantime, as trade negotiators enter a crucial part of the NAFTA renegotiations, trade relations between the U.S. and Canada are going in the wrong direction. 3. EPA says a controversial herbicide is not harmful to humans For the past few years, a debate has been raging over Monsanto’s use of glyphosate, the main ingredient in Round-Up, the top-selling weed killer sprayed on millions of acres of crops across the globe every year. Environmentalists and consumer groups have argued that the ingredient is toxic and petitioned the European Union and the United States to ban it, which would deal the company a major financial blow. Monsanto has aggressively disputed those claims, arguing that there is no evidence that glyphosate is dangerous to humans. This week, EPA came down clearly on Monsanto’s side. In a draft risk assessment," the agency said that glyphosate likely does not cause cancer and that there are """"no other meaningful risks to human health when the product is used according to the pesticide label.” The finding contradicts a 2015 report from the World Health Organization", which found that glyphosate was a “probable carcinogen.” But more recently, the evidence has begun to swing in the company’s favor: Last month, a long-term study on glyphosate found no firm link between the herbicide and cancer, a finding that Monsanto has used to dispute the 2015 WHO report. The EPA finding, which is just a draft and will now go through a 60-day comment period, means Monsanto is on something of a winning streak. Late last month, the EU voted to renew glyphosate’s license for five years, a major defeat for environmentalists who lobbied for a ban or strict limitations on use of the chemical. EPA will consider a similar renewal for glyphosate’s use in the U.S. in 2019. Its assessment this week spells good news for Monsanto when that review happens. 4. A (very) new era at Elizabeth’s Warren’s financial agency After Richard Cordray stepped down as head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the watchdog agency first proposed by Elizabeth Warren after the financial crisis, he set off a minor firestorm by attempting to install his deputy as acting director, hoping his Obama-era regulatory and enforcement priorities would survive a little longer. Trump went a very different direction: He installed the deregulatory hawk Mick Mulvaney, his White House budget chief, as acting director. Mulvaney immediately paused all ongoing enforcement and regulatory actions. And on Thursday, the CFPB announced that it intends to reconsider pieces of its 2015 rule, mandated under Dodd-Frank, that requires mortgage lenders to submit data on their borrowers’ race, ethnicity, sex, income and age, as well as pricing and underwriting standards, an effort to crack down on discriminatory practices in the housing market. The CFPB also will stop penalizing mortgage lenders that submit inaccurate data, as long as the errors were not “material.” The agency also said it intends to amend its 2016 rule on prepaid cards, which companies sometimes use instead of paychecks. The rule was intended to simplify a patchwork of state laws and protect consumers from fraud and abuse, including by mandating greater disclosures on overdraft limits. It was sharply criticized by financial firms as overly broad and difficult to implement. It’s unclear whether this action is a direct result of Mulvaney’s arrival; the CFPB had already found problems with its initial rule and delayed its implementation to next April. Either way, it’s clear that a new, conservative era has arrived at the CFPB. 5. EPA takes next step to rewrite the Clean Power Plan On October 16,2017, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt announced that his agency was officially going to repeal the Clean Power Plan, the Obama-era rules that imposed strict limits on greenhouse gas emissions. It was a decisive blow for perhaps Obama’s greatest effort to combat climate change and was cheered by conservatives and oil and gas companies who had slammed the Obama-era proposal. This week, Pruitt took the next step to rewrite the rule, issuing an “ advanced notice of proposed rulemaking ” to give the public a chance to comment on what a new rule should look like. In particular, the agency said that a new would rule likely focus on just coal-fired plants, not the broader power system. The agency also left one big question unanswered: Whether it will attempt to challenge the Supreme Court ruling that required the agency to regulate greenhouse gases. Many conservatives have asked Pruitt to challenge that ruling, known as the endangerment finding, but many lawyers and industry experts believe such a challenge would be futile. In the regulatory document," the EPA walks through the endangerment finding but says “nothing” in the document “should be construed as addressing or modifying the prior findings.” Whether Pruitt intends to actually challenge the endangerment finding—or will slowly issue a new rule—remains unclear.

57,Fake Christmas trees more popular with real people this year,"According to the American Christmas Tree Association, 81% of American households with Christmas trees will have artificial ones.",https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/12/11/fake-christmas-trees-more-popular-real-people-year/924980001/,2017-12-11T11:00:06Z,"A woman took photos of artificial Christmas trees while shopping at a J.C. Penney store in Seattle on Black Friday. (Photo: Elaine Thompson, AP) Spurred by the rise in Christmas tree prices, this may be the year that many families end years of arguments and buy a fake. Sure, that fresh-pine scent may not fill the living room, but from a practical standpoint, families are finding it makes sense. They won't have to worry about keeping the tree watered, about having to sweep up needles or that the tree might go up in flames in the middle of the night. Plus, the appearance of fake trees has improved dramatically in recent years. Mary Arraf, a mother of two, is making the leap. The 37-year-old automotive manager from Macomb, Mich., said safety and having to regularly clean up the mess were factors in her decision. The family spent $70 for a 7.5-footer, which she said was what they had planned to spend on a live tree. ""We got a regular green one, so it looks like a tree,"" she said. ""We put our own lights on it, too, to make it look like we did the work."" She's not nostalgic at all. ""I don’t love the scent,"" she said, adding: ""There are sprays now. If my husband is really crying over it, we can get that."" Arraf will be in good company. Of the estimated 95 million American households with Christmas trees this year, 81% will display fake ones, according to an American Christmas Tree Association survey conducted by Nielsen. The cost of buying a cut tree is 5% to 10% higher this year than last, says the trade group that represents growers, the National Christmas Tree Association. The shortage of seven- and eight-footers, the most popular size with families, is due to fewer trees that were planted during the recession a decade ago. More: That perfect Christmas tree will be harder to find, pricier this year More: Rockefeller Christmas trees support new homes More: Christmas tree growers may save the holidays For those who have made the fateful decision to go fake, here are five points to ponder when shopping for an artificial tree: Save some green over the long run A fake tree can last, basically, forever. The branches are usually made from green plastic, often polyvinyl chloride, the same stuff used for PVC piping in houses. So even though it may cost more initially, fake trees are cheaper in the long run. The challenge may come in finding a place to store it during the 11 months of the year that it's not the holiday season. Think big picture This tree will be with you for a while, so make sure it's what you want. Consider what height works best for your living space and decide whether you want one that comes already decked out with lights. Some trees have a music option too. Buyers will have to ask themselves how many seasons will they be able to tolerate its merry tunes. Cut some of the stress Gone are the days of hunting for the perfect specimen and working out the logistics of getting the big fir or pine home. The maintenance -- keeping the tree watered and picking up fallen needles -- may be gone but you'll still face the ordeal of having to lug the fake tree down from the attic or out from the back of the garage and blow off the dust each holiday season. Rest easier -- but still watch for hazards Artificial trees eliminate the ""Is tonight the night the tree catches fire?"" fear. Between 2011 and 2015, fire departments in the United States responded to an estimated yearly average of 200 home-structure fires that began with Christmas trees, reports the National Fire Protection Association. These blazes result in an average of six deaths, 16 injuries and $14.8 million in damages annually. Remember, though, artificial trees can burn, too -- just not as easily as a dried-out real one. Electrical cords can't be allowed to fray over the years. Say goodbye to the old tradition -- and in with the new This is the biggie: People wax poetically about the live-tree smell and the authentic, back-to-nature vibe a cut tree gives. For real-tree devotees, PVC is for quitters. Artificial tree advocates would point out family-heirloom ornaments can be hung on artificial branches as easily as on ones Mother Nature formed. And get a tree-scented air freshener, if you need to. After awhile, maybe you'll forget that the tree in the living room is a fake. Or maybe not. Your prized Christmas tree may be carrying more than just your ornaments, it could be teeming with literally thousands of bugs. Veuer's Nathan Rousseau Smith (@FantasticMrNate) explains.

58,Mexican Drug Cartels May Use Legal Marijuana to Take Over Northern California,"Legal marijuana was supposed to hurt the Mexican drug cartels, but narcos in California may be using it to plant the seeds of a takeover.",http://www.newsweek.com/2018/01/19/mexican-drug-cartels-taking-over-california-legal-marijuana-775665.html,2018-01-10T12:30:03Z,"The four men bolted through the forest, exhausted and bleeding from multiple cuts. When they emerged from the trees on that dry summer night in 2016, they spotted a house in the distance. They ran up to it and knocked on the stranger’s door, then frantically asked for help in broken English. The stranger called the police. When the cops arrived, the men told a harrowing story of being beaten by armed guards at an illegal pot farm and fleeing for their lives. The men, who were all Latino, described to the police where the farm was located, just outside a heavily forested area in California’s Calaveras County. Soon, the authorities sent up a team to raid the farm. What they discovered: more than 23,000 marijuana plants producing upwards of $60 million worth of weed. They also found two women they believe were selling marijuana for the Mexican drug cartels. Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now For months in Calaveras County, a rural, conservative enclave about 125 miles east of San Francisco, this drug bust generated local headlines. But federal authorities say Mexican drug cartels are propping up black-market marijuana farms like this all across Northern California. More than 160 years ago, immigrants, business tycoons and speculators poured into these foothills along the Sierra Nevada to mine the ridges and pan the streams for gold. Now weed is sparking the next gold rush, and law enforcement is struggling to keep cartels out of the game, even though recreational marijuana became legal in California on January 1 and medical marijuana has been permitted since 1996. For more than a decade, the Mexican drug cartels have been illegally growing weed in the forests of the United States, and federal agencies have had mixed success destroying these illicit crops. Today, California is the epicenter of black-market marijuana in the U.S., with over 90 percent of the country’s illegal marijuana farms. The authorities say they’re finding cartel-affiliated weed on government-owned lands in states including Oregon, Utah, Washington, Nevada and Arizona, all of which permit some form of medical marijuana. The problem has gotten so bad that in 2016, Colorado began partnering with the Mexican Consulate to bust the narcos. Today, activists in California counties such as Calaveras are pushing back, trying to ban cannabis farms to cut off the cartels. They say drug traffickers are importing automatic weapons and using illegal, highly toxic pesticides that are eviscerating forest animals and poisoning freshwater sources. “We’re going down the toilet bowl,” says Calaveras County Sheriff Rick DiBasilio, “and it’s not going to get any better.” But some legal weed farmers in the area say the authorities and their allies are exaggerating the problem, playing on stereotypes about race and crime to instill fear in locals. As Jack Norton, a Calaveras County marijuana grower, puts it, “Just because a guy and his cousin want to grow weed in the woods doesn’t mean they’re affiliated with ‘El Chapo.’” In early January, the Trump administration gave federal prosecutors more power to go after state marijuana industries, which are still illegal at the federal level. It's still unclear how that move will affect California. But in Calaveras, legal weed farmers fear a blanket ban would crush the local economy and cut off millions of dollars in taxes from going to local law enforcement. Last year, the cops in Calaveras started using that money to purchase ballistic helmets, ballistic shields and tactical gun sights—in part to confront a black-market takeover by the drug cartels. ‘It’s Not Cheech and Chong’ On a recent Sunday afternoon, snow dusted the trees of Mountain Ranch, a bucolic stretch of hills and valleys in the center of Calaveras County. Two and a half years ago, the area was almost entirely covered with lush forest, but in September 2015, two days before California created a state licensing system for medical marijuana, a tree fell onto a power line near the town of Jackson, sparking a forest fire that torched nearly 71,000 acres. The blaze fanned out south, incinerating large pockets of Calaveras. Some of those hills and valleys remain charred, and the clearings reveal what had long been hidden: black plastic tubs filled with marijuana seedlings. These are used by sophisticated, industrial marijuana farms, and many of them are within a 20-minute drive from the Mountain Ranch town center. “It’s not Cheech and Chong,” says Karen Harper, a member of the pro-legalization Calaveras Cannabis Alliance, referring to the people who harvest this crop. “They’re not lazy-ass hippies. They work hard.” Months after the fire, Calaveras announced a temporary ordinance to regulate commercial marijuana farms. That led to a flood of cannabis investors pouring in from across the country. The damage from the fire had decimated property values in Mountain Ranch, and investors showed up in droves to purchase land from families whose homes were destroyed. “We call it the green rush,” says Bill Schmiett, a local real estate agent. Now marijuana drives the economy here. A study by the University of Pacific in nearby Stockton found that more than 740 commercial growers in the area generated nearly $400 million in sales and labor income in 2016. But that study may underestimate the crop’s total impact. The county planning department estimates there are anywhere from 700 to 1,500 illegal marijuana farms sprawled across private property or government-owned lands in Calaveras. Illegal pot farms aren’t new to California. Since the September 11, 2001, attacks, which led to tighter control along the U.S.-Mexico border, marijuana plantations have been on the rise in forests across the northern part of the state. That surge has increased over the past three years—and investigators have been finding more and more illegal pot farms in California forests. In 2014, Stephen Frick, a special agent for the U.S. Forest Service, and his colleagues culled 671,000 plants from national forests in California. In 2016, that figure doubled. Now that the state has legalized recreational marijuana, growers are rushing into rural areas in Northern California to set up illegal farms, with one county even declaring a “state of emergency” last September over the rise of black-market growers. Frick doesn’t think that will slow down. “All the indications so far this year are that [seizures of illegal pot] are going to continue to increase.” Dr. Mourad Gabriel, (front right), Executive Director of the Integral Ecology Research Center, and two of his assistants begin to assess the scope of damage at one of the camps within a grow in Plumas National Forest. A member of the team has just shouted that they've found a suspicious package hanging from a tree. The package turned out to be a poison trap full of carbofuran, a highly lethal neurotoxin. Growers will booby trap their campsites in efforts to keep wildlife from coming into living quarters which are strewn with garbage and food. Photograph by Morgan Heim Just east of Mountain Ranch is the Stanislaus National Forest, another prime location for illegal weed farms. Investigators—from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to the Calaveras County Sheriff’s Office—have found hundreds of thousands of plants tended by undocumented workers on that government-owned land. “Over 80 percent of the people we arrest in these grows,” says Frick, “are here illegally from Mexico.” Many, he says, are from Michoacán, a drug-war-ravaged state in the western part of the country. Frick and other authorities believe the narcos lure workers across the border, promising well-paying jobs patrolling the fields and producing weed on an industrial scale. Others, they say, are brutally forced into it. Cartel players either threaten workers at gunpoint to keep them tending the crops or threaten to kill their family members back in Mexico if they don’t finish the harvest. Because the workers aren’t U.S. citizens, the cartels know they’re unlikely to ask the police for help. Most are afraid to tell investigators who they’re working for, or to testify as witnesses. “If I tell you, they’ll kill me,” one grower told a retired Calaveras law enforcement officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he thinks cartel members are stalking him and his wife. In Calaveras, Sheriff DiBasilio says it’s very hard to arrest people growing illegally. “We’ve done hundreds of flyovers” of pot farms with helicopters, he says. “But as soon as they hear you coming, they’re gone.” Of the growers they have caught, DiBasilio says, the vast majority are undocumented. Calaveras authorities have never received a confession from arrested farmers that links them to Mexican drug cartels. Yet Frick and the California attorney general’s office believe the illegal weed goes into the nationwide pipeline coordinated by organizations such as the Sinaloa cartel and La Familia Michoacana. One piece of evidence? Phone calls and wire transfers of money that travel south, to the border. Frick and other authorities also point to the cult idols they so often find on the pot farms. The retired Calaveras law enforcement officer says he and his colleagues used to find statues of Jesús Malverde, a so-called narco saint from the Mexican state of Sinaloa, at illegal farms in Calaveras County after raids. The legend of Malverde is that he was a Robin Hood–like figure during the 19th century. Cartels first used his image in the 1980s as part of a slick PR campaign to suggest that their criminal empire was built to provide economic opportunity for the country’s poor. Not all of Malverde’s followers are criminals, but in the United States authorities see him as an emblem of the Mexican drug trade. When Chicago cops pulled over a car carrying $19 million of cocaine in 2010, they said it was the Malverde statue on the dashboard that tipped them off. When law enforcement started investigating the four battered men who escaped from that Calaveras black-market pot farm, they visited the home addresses affiliated with the two women suspected of running the operation. At one of the homes, they found a shrine to another Mexican folklore saint commonly associated with drug traffickers: the Grim Reaper–esque Santa Muerte. (Members of law enforcement have discovered that figure when busting migrant smugglers, MS-13 gang operations and cartel rings along the U.S.-Mexico border.) More alarming than these folklore figurines, however, was what they found back at the farm: heaps of trash, dirty black tarps and a makeshift log cabin where the four men lived in putrid conditions. These growers were polluting the forest while reaping an enormous profit—a trade-off that’s happening in illegal farms across Northern California. 14,000 Pounds of Rodenticide Hours north of Calaveras, deep in public forests along the California-Oregon border, 12 tons of plastic trash, thousands of pounds of fertilizers and more than 80 pounds of toxic rodenticides and pesticides lay strewn among towering pines and oaks—turning this Eden into a landfill. Mourad Gabriel, a wildlife pathologist who runs the Integral Ecology Research Center, first encountered this black-market marijuana farm in 2015. He described its festering conditions in an unpublished cache of research he allowed me to preview. Gabriel estimates that criminal organizations are pouring 14,000 pounds of rodenticide and 750,000 pounds of water-soluble chemical fertilizers into the soil on government-protected land every year. Those estimates are based on his fieldwork on more than 120 illegal marijuana farms in public forests across seven counties in Northern California. At these sites, Gabriel has also found the crumpled, poisoned bodies of bears, deer, foxes, rodents and at-risk species like mountain lions. One of the chemicals killing these animals: carbofuran, a pesticide that’s illegal to use on crops in the United States, though still available for purchase online. “Growers often store the concentrate—bubble-gum pink in color—in soda and Gatorade bottles,” Gabriel and his colleagues wrote in a recent op-ed for The Wildlife Professional magazine. “Just a drop is sufficient to kill an adult human.” The unexpected presence of a new marijuana plant at an eradicated grow sets off alarm bells for Dr. Mourad Gabriel, the Director of the Integral Ecology Research Center. It is not uncommon for eradicated, but un-reclaimed grows to become repopulated by the cartel. When Gabriel pulls the plant from the ground, he sighs relief. The root structure of the plant indicates to him that this new plant is a product of the unlikely – the successful offspring of male, female pollination and survival of northern California’s harsh winter. This means the plant grew on its own, and is not the product of new planting. Photograph by Morgan Heim He has talked with men caught tending illegal marijuana farms to learn why they deployed such powerful chemicals to protect their crops. “I would ask, ‘Where did you learn these mechanisms for poisoning wildlife?’ And they’d say, ‘That’s what we did back home’”—in Mexico. Part of the legalization argument is that regulating and taxing marijuana could give California enforcement agencies the funds they need to eradicate illegal farms. But Gabriel thinks it will take years before enforcement can put a dent in the illegal grows that he estimates pop up by the hundreds every year. He points to Humboldt County, about five hours northwest of Calaveras, where authorities are combing through 2,300 applications for growers who want to start selling in California’s recreational market. But there are also an estimated 12,700 illegal farms in the county. Not all of those farmers are claiming allegiance to narco-trafficking clans back in Mexico. But what alarms Gabriel most, aside from the environmental damage, is the growing number of firearms. In 2012, he says, he encountered guns at two of the 20 illegal marijuana farms he investigated. Now, he’s finding them at nearly every site he comes across. “This is not Ma and Pa growing out in the hills,” says Gabriel. “These are literally drug trafficking organizations that are there to protect their investment.” Silent, Sober Majority? Anti-pot activists in Calaveras say the influx of firearms and toxic pollution is enough reason to bar the industry as a whole, and most of the county’s conservative-held government backs their cause. On a Wednesday in November, more than 40 residents packed into a small Calaveras County government meeting as the county planning board worked on a proposal to limit commercial marijuana farms to just 50. If turned into law, that would kick out nearly 150 farmers who have already started legal marijuana operations—but leave Calaveras’s 700 to 1,500 black-market growers untouched. The meeting quickly grew divisive. As weed farmers and anti-pot activists stood up and shared their opinions on the ordinance, people jeered and hissed across the aisle, yelling at speakers to sit down and booing officials as they commented in favor or against the proposal. “Protect us!” shouted a weed farmer at one point during the eight-hour session. “Protect us !” shouted anti-pot activists in response. In the far corner, among the anti-pot activists, sat Bill McManus, a potbellied man with a slight drawl whose white moustache is stained yellow-brown by tobacco smoke. He and his colleague David Tunno are the de facto leaders of the anti-pot movement up here. They call themselves mouthpieces for the “silent majority” that wants weed out. Last year, they collected more than 5,000 petition signatures for a ban proposition, which was enough to float it in front of the county supervisors. And Tunno says that number could have been much higher. “A lot of these people are so damn scared they won’t even help us. They don’t want their name attached to our cause.” Tunno and McManus drum up support with what they call local “war stories”—tales of Calaveras residents accidentally driving into a backwoods illegal farm, where armed men descend upon their car and threaten to find out where they live if they don’t turn back. Or the local ranchers who patrol their plots of land with Kevlar vests strapped across their chests, afraid they’ll stumble upon an armed crew. “You don’t enjoy your property. You don’t go out for walks. You don’t have your grandkids up riding the pony, or bicycles or ATV,” says McManus. “You can’t do that anymore because it’s too dangerous.” All that glitters is not gold. In California, trespass marijuana grows account for a multibillion dollar industry. The grows are sophisticated and covert operations. Rather than clear an area, many cartels will instead plant marijuana in the understory. This particular grow on National Forest land in the High Sierras was busted and reclaimed. Only the divots of where plants used to be remain. While the remnants of this former crop look neat and tidy, marijuana grown on public land is quickly poisoning the environment, wildlife and water. This plot in this one grow was the site for more than 1,200 plants. Some grows reach as many as 40,000 Photograph by Morgan Heim And it’s not just the anti-pot camp that wants the black market shut down. Burch Shufeldt, a registered marijuana grower, claims he’s had run-ins with cartel growers near his properties. He showed me the remnants of what he claims was a cartel grow in the Stanislaus forest—a space littered with pots and pans, chemical fertilizers, felled trees and black hoses—and brought me to a grassy mountaintop above his isolated cabin where cellphone service barely trickles in. “You’d come screaming up the hill on a quad,” he says, “and there’d be this huge Escalade sitting right here.” The six registered pot farmers I interviewed for this story said they believe Mexican cartels or their affiliates are active in Calaveras. But they want to keep weed legal, not only because it’s their livelihood but because their tax dollars help combat the illegal farms. “There’s the hard-core black market with organized criminals,” says Cas Tomaszewski, former director of the Calaveras Cannabis Alliance. “And then there are growers with kids who’ve been doing this here for years.” A total and complete ban on growing pot would hobble the local economy, he says, and could lead to even more drug-related violence. No commercial cannabis means no multimillion-dollar tax boon for the county and its law enforcement officers, who used marijuana tax funds to raid about 40 illegal farms and seize nearly 30,000 pot plants in 2017. “We’re lucky anybody wants to live in this county,” says Harper, of the pro-legalization Calaveras Cannabis Alliance. “And they want to stop something that provides millions of dollars.” Regardless of what becomes of the Trump administration’s push to enforce federal marijuana laws, the county has until February 2018, when its current weed farm ordinance expires, to make up its mind. Outside the county planning meeting, McManus and a small group of anti-pot activists talked about the next step in their yearslong campaign. They’d saturated county roads with anti-pot banners, attended hundreds of county supervisor meetings and visited stores that serve the marijuana industry to lambaste business owners. Now their plan is to sit back and watch. Like Colorado, argues McManus, California will see that legalization and more taxes aren’t enough to kick out the black market. “I think it needs to hurt a little bit,” he says, “before it gets better.” One of the anti-pot activists next to him unzips a compartment in her purse to show me her first-ever pistol holster. No matter what the county decides, this group tells me, their only option is to protect themselves from the armed pot farmers who are now their next-door neighbors. “We’re militarizing,” says a local cattle rancher, who asked for anonymity out of fear of being confronted by criminal growers. “We’re all getting bigger guns, we’re all getting bigger dogs, [and] we’re all getting bigger electric gates.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59,First medical marijuana farm comes to this big state,Ohio joins the growing list,https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2017/12/18/first-medical-marijuana-farm-comes-big-state/961285001/,2017-12-18T17:21:45Z,"A new study says second hand marijuana smoke could lead to failed drug tests. TC Newman (@PurpleTCNewman) has details on this University of Calgary research. Buzz60 Village officials in Yellow Springs, Ohio break ground a new medical marijuana growing site (Photo: Randy Tucker/The Enquirer) CINCINNATI -- Add the Buckeye State to the list of those that have attracted medical marijuana growers. The CEO of a medical marijuana company that broke ground on Ohio's first cultivation facility in Yellow Springs last week described the Dayton-area community as tailor-made for his new venture. ""If we were going to create this new version of cannabis (production) in an area that never had it before, it was really important to have a solid relationship with the community,'' said Charles Bachtell, founder and CEO of Chicago-based Cresco Labs. ""Yellow Springs was on board with this collaborative process as soon as we started talking. We really hit it off.'' Bachtell plans to build a $7 million, 50,000-square-foot state-of-the-art greenhouse on eight acres of land in the town perched midway between Dayton and Columbus. For Bachtell, there is no better location in Ohio to set up shop than the remote enclave of about 3,700 people whose most famous resident, comedian Dave Chappelle, has described it as a ""hippie town'' for its free-spirited, counterculture reputation. ""I wasn't initially aware of the town's reputation, but it was interesting to find that out,'' said Bachtell, who began pursuing a license in Ohio shortly after medical marijuana was legalized in the state last year. Students at a small midwestern college can now major in medical plant chemistry. Basically, it's a degree in marijuana. Buzz60 Cresco was one of 12 businesses selected earlier this month from 109 applicants to run Ohio's large marijuana farms of up to 25,000 square feet. The Yellow Springs facility will include 25,000 square feet of growing space plus 25,000 square feet of offices, harvesting and packaging rooms, according to Bachtell, who also has marijuana growing and retail operations in Illinois and Pennsylvania. It will incorporate the latest indoor commercial agriculture technology and environmental controls. ""Calling it a greenhouse almost does it a disservice,'' Bachtell said. ""I like to call it a super technologically advanced warehouse with a translucent roof on top.'' The project promises to have a direct economic impact on the Yellow Springs community, including at least 150 new construction jobs and dozens of full-time employees once completed, according to Bachtell. And he said his company is proceeding with construction as planned despite threats from state and local officials to freeze the recently awarded cultivation licenses after discovering that one of the consultants hired to score applications was a convicted drug dealer. ""Everybody needs to step back and remember that this is a medical law that was passed specifically to help patients in Ohio,'' Bachtell said. Freezing the licenses ""would be doing a disservice to the patients and people of Ohio, and the law that was passed.'' The drug charges were first revealed by Cincinnati-based investor Jimmy Gould of Green Light Acquisitions, who applied for a growing license in Wilmington, Ohio, but was denied. Gould has since threatened to sue the Ohio Department of Commerce, which oversees the growing, processing and testing parts of Ohio's medical marijuana program, and called for the selection process to be started over again because of the application grader's drug conviction and other irregularities. ""Some people feel like they're entitled to one of the licenses, but that's not how it works,'' Bachtell said. ""The right companies that are doing this for the right reason are the ones that get selected.'' Bachtell is confident that obtaining a grower's license will help him secure the marijuana processing and dispensary licenses in Ohio for which he has applied.

60,Your Morning Cup of Coffee Is in Danger. Can the Industry Adapt in Time?,An industry unites to fight for endangered farms,http://time.com/5318245/coffee-industry-climate-change/,2018-06-21T10:28:21Z,"Howard Schultz wants to know if I drink coffee. The Starbucks boss is sitting on a balcony overlooking the company’s leafy farm in the Costa Rican province of Alajuela, where I’m told the coffee–harvested and roasted on-site–is a must-try. Like more than 60% of Americans, I drink coffee at least once a day, and sometimes I indulge twice or even three times. The Costa Rican blend Schultz pours me has a special taste that mixes citrus and chocolate flavors. But the future of my cup of Costa Rican Arabica is not guaranteed, Schultz says. After nearly four decades at Starbucks, he is leaving at the end of June, and in the role of executive chairman for almost 15 months, he has been looking past Starbucks’ day-to-day operations to its long-term challenges and opportunities. Climate change ranks high among them. As temperatures rise and droughts intensify, good coffee will become increasingly difficult to grow and expensive to buy. Since governments are reacting slowly to the problem, companies like Starbucks have stepped in to save themselves, reaching to the bottom of their supply chains to ensure reliable access to their product. “Make no mistake,” Schultz tells me, “climate change is going to play a bigger role in affecting the quality and integrity of coffee.” This farm, with its verdant vistas and a trickling waterfall, seems far removed from the rising sea levels, blistering heat and destructive storms that characterize climate change. But global warming is exactly why Starbucks bought the 600-acre plot in 2013, and why Schultz makes the 3,500-mile trip from Seattle a few times a year as he has done on this March day. The farm is Starbucks’ field laboratory into the threats posed to coffee by climate change and its testing facility for how it can adapt to the challenge. Schultz hopes that the research here will inform agricultural practices for millions of farmers across the globe, including the ones that supply the company. “We have to be in the soil, growing coffee, to understand firsthand how to rectify and fix the situation,” he says. Study after study has laid out the threat climate change poses to the coffee industry. Rising temperatures will bring drought, increase the range of diseases and kill large swaths of the insects that pollinate coffee plants. About half of the land around the world currently used to produce high-quality coffee could be unproductive by 2050, according to a recent study in the journal Climatic Change. Another paper, in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that that number could be as high as 88% in Latin America. While rising temperatures have caught many industries flat-footed, coffee companies have responded in force, bolstering their presence on the ground in coffee-growing countries like Costa Rica, Ethiopia and Indonesia. Instead of just purchasing coffee, they work with small farms to help them adapt to changing conditions, providing seeds, monitoring production and suggesting new agricultural practices. “Everybody talks about climate, but the only sector that’s actually doing something at scale is the coffee industry,” M. Sanjayan, the CEO of Conservation International, tells me as we tour the Starbucks farm in Alajuela. Not that the industry sees a choice. Declining supplies and a growing coffee-drinking population mean climate change could turn a daily pick-me-up into a high-priced luxury, threatening the continued growth of the industry’s customer base. Addressing that challenge was an important facet of Schultz’s job in his final years at Starbucks. “It’s not only about the environment,” he says of his work on climate change. “It’s also to procure high-quality coffee, to get the best possible yield, at the best possible price.” During our visit to the Starbucks farm, Schultz stops at the company’s Costa Rican farmer support center. The structure is designed to accommodate crops brought in fresh from the field, but still maintains the gloss of a corporate office for the high-level executives who cycle through on occasion. Schultz greets Carlos Mario Rodriguez, director of global agronomy at Starbucks, with a big smile and a familiar handshake. In this building, Rodriguez meets with local farmers, offering them different seed varieties developed on-site and advising them on how to protect their yield in the face of a changing climate. When he’s not teaching planters, Rodriguez, the former head of Costa Rica’s national coffee institute, spends his days among the coffee trees on the property, surveying experiments designed to develop the perfect coffee bean–one that can survive drought and heat while also meeting the company’s quality standards. On the farm, he stops to show me one 4,300-sq.-ft. field where he says 50 new coffee varietals are being tested for their climate resilience as well as taste. Rodriguez and his research are the vanguard of Starbucks’ efforts to adapt. Beginning in 2013, Starbucks decided to invest in growing its footprint in coffee-producing countries. It now has support centers in nine countries–a number Schultz said could triple in the coming years–and a 10-year, $500 million investment fund that supports sustainability programs, such as adaptation training for farmers and testing new coffee varieties. All this work on the ground in Costa Rica may sound obvious. Companies in sectors from energy to technology invest in research and development to better their products. But the coffee behemoth’s focus on local farms represents a seismic shift. Selling coffee to consumers has always been a separate business from growing the beans. And because an estimated 25 million people farm coffee around the globe, big coffee companies have typically found suppliers in whichever place experienced a strong harvest that year. If one country’s yield suffered, the companies simply looked elsewhere. But with climate change, that supply chain is no longer assured. Arabica coffee–the variety found at Starbucks, Dunkin’ Donuts, McDonald’s and pretty much every other American retailer–grows in a narrow region of the tropics known as the Coffee Belt, which stretches from Central America to sub-Saharan Africa to Asia. Conditions must be just right or a harvest is lost. In the past, some areas occasionally experienced off years because of a bad storm or a temperature fluctuation. Researchers say that in the future such challenges will be constant. Farmers in some regions will be able to adapt by growing at higher elevations, but in others there is nowhere else to go. Entire regions risk becoming unable to continue producing Arabica coffee, and Schultz and others say there’s no way to make the more resilient Robusta variety, which is sometimes blended with Arabica to make instant coffee, palatable to the broad coffee-drinking public. Scientists also warn that climate change increases the likelihood of disease, including the dreaded la roya, or stem rust. That disease cut coffee production in Central America by about 15% in the 2012–13 growing year. Due in large part to rust, the price of a pound of coffee for consumers in the U.S. jumped roughly 33% between ’11 and ’13. “Climate change is good,” says William Corrales Cruz, a small-coffee-farm owner in the Costa Rican region of Naranjo. “If you sell rust.” Starbucks says it is eager to share the lessons it learns about adaptive farming with coffee growers around the globe. For big coffee companies buying from a variety of small suppliers, the argument goes, there’s no value in trying to gain a competitive advantage by hoarding trade secrets. Improving all coffee growers’ ability to survive climate change benefits the entire industry, Schultz says. The company’s network of farmer support centers distributes free seeds, teaches new adaptation methods and serves as a resource for farmers who are eager to learn how to adapt, regardless of whether they do business with Starbucks. “It may be hard for people to understand why we are sharing all this information,” says Schultz. “If we don’t, there’s going to be tremendous adverse pressure on the coffee industry.” Starbucks will find plenty of interest in the results of its research. Dwindling supply is a big problem for an industry that projects global coffee demand to double by 2050, driven by population increases and a growing coffee-addicted middle class in Asia, Africa and elsewhere. As a result, nearly every major coffee retailer is paying closer attention to the source of its beans than ever before. The companies whose products touch nearly every American household–think Starbucks, Keurig Green Mountain, J.M. Smucker and countless others–have installed themselves at the ground level of the coffee supply chain in a way unimaginable even a generation ago. Small farmers now interact directly with big-name coffee retailers after years of dealing with local traders only. “In the beginning, it was scary,” says Sara Bogantes Vargas, a regional coordinator for the industry-funded World Coffee Research (WCR), of the farmers’ reaction to seeing the Starbucks farm in their backyard. But Bogantes Vargas says the planters quickly came to welcome the industry’s help. WCR, for which Bogantes Vargas travels around Central America to meet with farmers, is a consortium supported by dozens of major coffee retailers, distributors and exporters. The institute pumps millions of dollars into lab research and coffee field trials every year. The scale is enormous. WCR’s $18 million coffee-monitoring program, for example, covers 1,100 farms in 20 countries. It includes on-the-ground training for farmers, technical assistance throughout the trials and supply-chain analysis. In each of those farms, located from Peru to Kenya, WCR has taken over a small portion of farmers’ land for an experiment testing coffee varieties and various adaptive farming methods. WCR and partner agronomists plant different coffee hybrids, take soil samples and test techniques like planting trees for shade. Like the research conducted by Starbucks, the results will be shared with the public, WCR says. Individual retailers have invested in fighting climate change’s effect on their business as well. In El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua, Keurig has funded a program to teach farmers how to implement new agricultural practices tailored for times when water availability is limited. The program is an integral piece of the nearly $10 million the company spends annually to support farmers. “When there are climate challenges in particular locations, we have the ability to source from other places,” says Colleen Popkin, senior sustainability manager at Keurig. “Farmers don’t have that flexibility … and those farmers are part of our long-term growth trajectory.” Illycaffè takes a similar approach through what the company has termed the University of Coffee, a program with some 30,000 participants around the world. The initiative began in 1999 in Italy as a forum for a range of coffee professionals from baristas to growers looking to improve their business, and since then has focused on helping farmers learn practices that will be sustainable in the face of a changing climate. The initiative trains thousands of farmers a year in more than 20 countries. Training farmers sits at the “very center of our strategy,” says Andrea Illy, chairman of Illycaffè, who estimates that the coffee industry spends more than $100 million each year to adapt. But Illy says that number needs to multiply. “There is a huge gap,” he says. “The best educated guess is that in order to adapt to climate change, we would need as an overall industry to invest something like $1 billion per year to rejuvenate plantations, develop new varieties, improve equipment, even migrate some coffee plantations.” The sweet fragrance wafting through the air in the Costa Rican region of Naranjo, about 25 miles from the Starbucks farm, is unmistakable. Bogantes Vargas and I are walking through a large coffee farm an hour’s drive from San José, the country’s capital, looking at blossoming flowers on coffee trees. As sweet as it smells, the odor from the plants is also unsettling. It’s early March, and the plants here should not bloom for weeks, Bogantes Vargas says. The harvest from a plant that blooms too early could be lost for an entire season. In Costa Rica, farmers say climate change has already made it difficult to predict harvest conditions. “One year it’s too short, one year it’s too long,” says Corrales Cruz of the rainy season. The nation’s coffee industry is suffering as a result. Fifteen years ago the average coffee farm in Costa Rica produced about 14.5 bags of coffee per acre. Today that number is down to fewer than 10 bags per acre. It’s a harbinger for the coffee industry, and a sign of the seriousness of its adaptation challenge: climate change is happening now, and it is happening fast. Remaking the complex system of trees, plants and wildlife that allow for coffee to thrive in a particular place takes careful consideration over an extended period of time. “Changes we make today,” says Peter Läderach, a climate-change specialist at the Colombia-based International Center for Tropical Agriculture, “may only be yielding fruits in five or 10 years.” And no matter how much money the industry pumps into research, or how many boots companies put on the ground for retraining, the future of coffee remains at the mercy of a global population that continues to pump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Average temperatures are expected to rise by more than 5.5°F by 2100 even if countries follow through on their commitments to reduce global warming, according to data from the U.N. Environmental Programme. That’s far short of the U.N. goal of keeping temperature rise below 3.6°F. All this has stark implications for the future of coffee. Which may be why Schultz, back at the Starbucks farm, segues unprompted into a discussion of government policy as we chat in a conference room overlooking the farm. He tells me that the U.S. needs to work to mitigate climate change and return to the Paris Agreement, which the Trump Administration announced in 2017 that it would leave. “We have to remove ourselves from the politics,” he says, “and do everything we can to preserve and enhance our industry and our company.” (Schultz, who is often discussed as a potential Democratic presidential candidate, stressed that he remains a private citizen despite at times sounding ready for the campaign trail.) As we leave the Starbucks farm, Bogantes Vargas, the daughter of a coffee farmer, points out the old coffee plantations that have closed as a result of years of water shortages. Some have been converted into resort homes for foreigners. Others lie abandoned. The fields, lush in some places but brown in others, are a reminder that Schultz, the coffee industry and the authorities charged with stopping climate change need to move fast.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE LONDON — Brown is the color of the summer in northern Europe this year. Fields that are usually covered in lush green grass have now turned to dust, trees are shedding their leaves and animals are eating dry hay or grain instead of grazing in pastures. Farmers in around a dozen countries — from Ireland to the Baltics — are grappling with a once-in-a-generation drought. The unrelenting heat wave has devastated crops, with more than half of the harvest expected to be lost in some areas. Potato plants suffer in the heat in a field in Germany. picture alliance / picture alliance via Getty Image “I have never seen this type of hot and dry weather and I’ve been farming over 30 years,” Max Schulman told NBC News from his farm about 35 miles outside of Helsinki, Finland, where he grows beans, oats, wheat and oilseeds. Schulman says his farm has received just 3 inches of rain since the end of April, compared to between 10 and 14 inches most years. In many areas, the scale of the damage is not yet known as harvests have not been completed. However, some of the crops hit by the drought include: Onions and carrots. U.K. growers expect losses of 30 to 40 percent for carrots and at least 25 percent for onions. Pototoes. At least 25 percent of Germany's harvest is likely to be affected. Corn. Around 60 percent has been destroyed in the Netherlands. Cereals like wheat, barley and oats. At least 35 percent of the harvest has been lost in Sweden. The drought has hit Denmark particularly hard, with the spring harvest of grains and vegetables down between 40 and 50 percent, according to Troels Toft, an official with the Danish Agriculture and Food Council. He estimates that the losses will cost the country's farming industry around $944 million. These satellite images show how this year's heat wave has taken its toll on vegetation in northern Germany, Denmark and Sweden. The first image shows how green the vegetation looked on June 30 and how it appeared dry and brown around two weeks later. ESA “We haven’t seen anything like this for the last 150 years or so,” he said. “When you drive around Denmark it’s not the country we are used to seeing. Some farmers will go bankrupt that’s for sure. If you had problems before the drought then this can be the push over the edge.” Farming associations across northern Europe are turning to their governments and to the E.U. for support, including in economic powerhouse Germany, where losses are expected to top $1.1 billion. Dried-out sunflowers in a field near Breydin, Germany, on Monday. Fabrizio Bensch / Reuters file The loss of crops has consequences for people and animals. In addition to likely price rises for staples like wheat, vegetables will be smaller than usual this year. Breweries and whiskey distilleries that depend on barley and other grains are watching the harvest carefully to see how the situation will affect supply and pricing. Meanwhile, farmers who rely on grass to feed their cows, pigs and sheep have already had to break into their winter food rations. With not enough grass for their livestock, some have started to sell animals from their herds. ""We've had very bad luck recently — last year was rainy and we missed the last cut of grass because it was too wet to harvest. And now we're missing another cut,"" said Mikkel Juhl Nielsen, an organic beef and milk farmer in Denmark. He plans to reduce his herd from 180 cows to 150 before the winter. The drought has caused more than just crop failures — wildfires in Sweden burned tens of thousands of acres of land. The extreme weather comes as no surprise to scientists or to farmers, who say they are on the front line of climate change. In Britain, farmers are facing more than just the weather. Since the 2016 Brexit vote to leave the European Union, there’s been a sharp decrease in the availability of workers from other parts of the 28-country bloc in the U.K. That has meant farmers have been forced to leave good fruit rotting on the vine because no one is available to pick it, while leaving other fields fallow to avoid crops going to waste. “This unprecedented spell of weather really should be a wake-up call for us all. It’s a timely reminder that we shouldn’t take food production for granted,” said Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers Union in the U.K. But Max Schulman and other farmers say even help from the government won’t be enough to make up for this summer's weather-related losses. “To a single farmer this type of year is catastrophic,” Schulman said. “We are a minority but we play a big role in the economy and in your daily life.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mask, she says, is infused with chamomile and sage and aloe vera, plus one ingredient that she still has to explain to her clients: CBD. An aesthetician, Franklin started working with an Oregon chemist last year to make CBD products for the skin, believing that a little of it swiped onto the face could help repair the ravages of age. But Franklin also takes CBD in gummy form, popping some in the morning and some at night. Like a magic pill, she says, it wipes away the sleeplessness and the stress and the nagging pain in her back that has left her with a slight limp, though she’s only in her 30s. “It’s crazy,” she acknowledges. But she insists that CBD can do it all. “It’s just crazy, the different things that it has helped.” For Generation Anxious, affixed to its phones and stricken by news alerts, overworked and under-rested, the mysterious substance known as CBD is quickly becoming the new “it” drug. Devotees whisper about CBD as a soothing remedy for racing thoughts and aching extremities. CBD for those restless nights. Also, somehow, CBD for those listless mornings. Suddenly, you can find sugar-coated CBD gummies to gnaw on, and balms to rub onto pulse points. There’s CBD for your dog (gluten-free and pumpkin-flavored!) and CBD for your aching feet. You can buy bottled CBD water in trendy, seasonally-driven fast-casual restaurants, and bags of CBD-laced coffee in shops on busy thoroughfares in Washington, Colorado Springs, Las Vegas and dozens of other cities. Back at Joy’s, Osorio, the mask still plastered on her face, pipes up about her own experience with CBD, how it seemed to quiet the back spasms she has suffered since an accident years ago. Plus, is it just her imagination, or do her wrinkles seem to have faded? Have we mentioned CBD’s relationship to the green gold mine that is the American marijuana industry? (Surprise.) Also known by its full name, cannabidiol (pronounced canna-bid-EYE-ol), CBD is just one of hundreds of compounds hiding within the cannabis plant. It’s a distant cousin of THC, the stuff in pot that’s notorious for getting you stoned and for inciting the wrath of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. But while the term “cannabidiol” smacks of weed, “CBD” somehow sounds... tame. Like something you can name-drop around Mom, like turmeric and melatonin and charcoal and biotin or any of the other wonder-elixirs that have replaced Prozac in America’s medicine cabinets. The dizzying rise of CBD is a story of timing as much as of branding. As more states deregulate marijuana, the Reefer Madness stigma that surrounded it for decades seems to have gone up in smoke. But here’s why CBD appeals to some who would never smoke a joint after dinner: Take a few milligrams of CBD as, say, an oil slipped onto the tongue or a piece of candy, and it tastes unmistakably like cannabis, which is to say, slightly minty and herbacious, and just a little funky. But cannabidiol’s effect is startlingly anti-climactic. It’s weed without the high. And this may be why CBD is legal in many states, including several that don’t allow legal recreational or medical marijuana. An organic chemist named Roger Adams isolated cannabidiol amid a wave of research into the medicinal promise of marijuana in the 1930s and ’40s. He filed for a patent, and in the decades that followed, marijuana growers experimented with raising plants with high levels of CBD and almost no THC, hoping that a puff might trigger its own trippy bang. It didn’t take long for them to realize that they were wrong. So, so wrong. “CBD became known as the hippie’s disappointment,” says Stuart W. Titus, the chief executive of Medical Marijuana Inc., a producer of several CBD oils and products that entered the market in 2012. Now, the hippie’s disappointment is back, rebranded as the stressed-out modern office drudge’s salvation. Gwyneth Paltrow’s obsessively followed lifestyle site Goop, never one to miss a chance to gush about a wellness trend, recently published a guide to CBD cocktails. One of the many cushy lounges offering swag at Coachella next month is promising CBD oils, along with yoga and vegan food, for all its guests. A writer for the website the Cut wrote that a little CBD made her feel “delightful.” “Some people do want the high, of course,” Titus says. “But others are looking for the health and wellness benefits.” Which, according to the charter members of the Cult of Cannabidiol, are many. Infinite, in fact. “I like to call it the super-nutrient, the super plant,” says Spike Mendelsohn, the Washington-based former “Top Chef” contestant behind fast-casual restaurants including Good Stuff Eatery. More recently, he’s a partner in the CBD-infused “wellness drink” Plnt Water, which comes in such flavors as turmeric and ginger, and matcha and mint and, for now, is available in a healthy-leaning fast-casual restaurant chain. “It’s really mother’s milk,” he says. “It’s natural.” Naturally, not everyone is buying the hype. Last year, the FDA dinged a number of companies hawking CBD based on unsubstantiated claims — mainly that it could cure or reverse cancer. The agency hasn’t evaluated all the claims around CBD, but some in the research field already have their doubts. “I think you’re dealing with disease states where people are grasping for answers,” says Timothy E. Welty, a professor of pharmacy at Drake University in Des Moines. “So they’re turning to this and saying, ‘This is the answer.’ ” Welty has been involved with CBD use in patients with epilepsy, and at least two reputable studies have shown it can relieve seizures. But as for the rest of it — the anxiety and sleep claims, all anecdotal — he’s doubtful. “They’re not scientifically founded, in my mind,” he says. So: Is CBD just this year’s activated charcoal or functional mushroom ? Harmless enough to pop without worry? “I would be very cautious,” Welty says. With no oversight of the candies and waters and food products containing CBD, he says, “you’re not sure what you’re really getting.” For true believers, though, it’s worth venturing into the unknown if it means tossing out the aspirin and the painkillers and the anti-depressants. “For a long time now, there have been people approaching a lot of chefs about working with cannabis and edibles,” Mendelsohn says. Weed seems like fun. “But is it worth risking all the other work that I have? I’m in business with my family. I do a lot of work with kids. I do a lot of work with policy.” Drugs? Unwise. The wellness space? Whole different ballgame, he says. Plus, there’s no question there’s a market for CBD. “People,” he says, “are already buying it.” Franklin is convinced of its powers. “I’ve had friends take CBD for the first time, and call me and say, ‘Where have you been all my life?’ ” she says.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63,Where Is Marijuana Legal? Peru The Latest Country To Legalize,Peru is the latest country to legalize medical marijuana. Where else is cannabis legal in the world?,http://www.newsweek.com/medical-marijuana-recreational-legalization-peru-716156,2017-11-18T23:48:36Z,"The president of Peru signed a bill on Thursday legalizing medical marijuana across the country, a historic move that came a few weeks after the Peruvian Congress voted to approve it. The legalization allows possession, sale, and transport of cannabis for medical purposes, but it’s still illegal to cultivate the plant. The government will develop a list of official importers or growers who are authorized to supply the nation’s new medical marijuana patients, who will be given prescriptions for conditions like Parkinson’s, cancer, epilepsy or other chronic or terminal illnesses. Peru is the latest Latin American nation to legalize marijuana in some form, but where else is cannabis legal? Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now People take part in the 'Grow your rights' rally in Santiago, demanding the legalization of marijuana on June 03, 2017 MARTIN BERNETTI/AFP/Getty Images In many countries, marijuana is only legal on a strict basis. In Australia, Greece, Croatia, Israel, Poland, Mexico, Finland, Turkey, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, Macedonia and Italy, consumers need prescriptions for one of just a few medical conditions. Laws leave some room for research purposes, which makes cannabis technically legal for some to grow, but there are still strict enforcements in place to criminalize most usage. Oftentimes it’s legal for people to possess marijuana, but not legal for anybody to cultivate or sell the drug, leaving a gray area that lowers the rate of arrests for possession but doesn’t allow for most other steps of the process. In Chile, the Latin American country with the highest per capita marijuana use, all public production and consumption cannabis is illegal, but Chilean Congress is debating a bill that would make it legal to grow up to six plants in a private home for “medical, recreational, or spiritual reasons.” In Denmark, marijuana is illegal unless you happen to be in Freetown, a neighborhood in Copenhagen that declared cannabis consumption and sales legal. The Danish police don't enforce federal laws in this neighborhood, that has become known as the “green light district.” Spain has a similar situation, that leaves a loophole for marijuana to be sold in certain private clubs and in private homes, but it’s not technically legal to sell or transport anywhere. South Africa has similar laws on consumption in private. Germany allows marijuana use with a medical prescription, and if you consume marijuana without one, it’s considered “self-harm” rather than a crime. In Colombia, medical marijuana is allowed and some consumption and cultivation in private is permitted. In India and the United States, legalization varies greatly state-by-state. Puerto Rico allows medical prescriptions but only in forms that cannot be smoked. Uruguay, the Netherlands and Jamaica are some of the most accepting nations when it comes to marijuana consumption. In Uruguay, marijuana is fully legalized for both medical and recreational purposes, and Jamaica allows Rastafarians to grow and use cannabis, and anybody can cultivate up to five plants for personal use, though it’s illegal for public use. Possession is legal in “coffeeshops” in the Netherlands, where it can be sold and consumed. Peru's legalization made the country one of more than 20 nations where marijuana laws have been expanded, but some Peruvians are looking for even further-reaching laws. Congress overwhelming voted to approve the new bill, but it only allows certain derivatives and products. “We’re very happy with the fact that Peruvian law has approved this,” said marijuana advocate Ana Alvarez in an interview with the Guardian. “But we’re not totally satisified.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64,Big labor sees growth potential in California pot workers,"The United Farm Workers, Teamsters and United Food and Commercial Workers are vying for the anticipated 100,000 cannabis workers in California.",https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/12/25/big-labor-sees-growth-potential-california-pot-workers/980761001/,2017-12-25T21:05:54Z,"With California set to become the largest legal pot economy in the country next year, small operators are becoming increasingly worried legalization will bring investment banks and corporate-sized interests that will push them out of the market. (Dec. 20) AP Thomas Grier works as a ""bud tender"" at Canna Can Help Inc., a medical marijuana dispensary in Goshen, Calif. Labor unions are vying to represent California cannabis workers when a new law takes effect in 2018 legalizing the sales of recreational marijuana. (Photo: Scott Smith, AP) GOSHEN, Calif. (AP) — Unions have caught a whiff of a rare opportunity to organize a whole new set of workers as recreational marijuana becomes legal in California. The United Farm Workers, Teamsters and United Food and Commercial Workers are looking to unionize the tens of thousands of potential workers involved in the legal weed game, from planters to rollers to sellers. The move could provide a boost to organized labor's lagging membership — if infighting doesn't get in the way. The United Farm Workers, co-founded by iconic labor leader Cesar Chavez, says organizing an industry rooted in agriculture is a natural fit, and growers could label their products with the union's logo as a marketing strategy. ""If you're a cannabis worker, the UFW wants to talk with you,"" national vice president Armando Elenes said. But United Food and Commercial Workers, which represents grocery store employees, meat packers and retail workers, registered its intent to organize cannabis workers across the country. ""We would hope they respect our jurisdiction,"" UFCW spokesman Jeff Ferro said. Teamsters organizer Kristin Heidelbach said there's no need for unions to battle each other. There will be plenty of workers needing representation as small cannabis businesses run by ""happy stoner"" types give way to large pharmaceutical corporations, she said. The green rush that begins in 2018 is an opportunity for unions to regain influence that began declining in the late 1950s, said David Zonderman, a professor of labor history at North Carolina State University. But discord between unions could upend it. As could resistance from cannabis business leaders. ""Are they going to be new-age and cool with it,"" Zonderman said, ""or like other businesspeople, say, 'Heck, no. We're going to fight them tooth and nail?'"" Last year, California voters approved sales of recreational marijuana to those 21 and older at licensed shops beginning Jan. 1. Cannabis in California already is a $22 billion industry, including medical marijuana and a black market that accounts for most of that total, according to University of California, Davis, agriculture economist Philip Martin. Medical marijuana has been legal since 1996, when California was the first state to approve such a law. Labor leaders estimate recreational pot in California could employ at least 100,000 workers from the north coast to the Sierra Nevada foothills and the San Joaquin Valley, harvesting and trimming the plants, extracting ingredients to put in liquids and edibles, and driving it to stores and front doors. More: At 'pot churches,' marijuana is the sacrament More: Marijuana infused wine soon to be available in California More: First medical marijuana farm comes to this big state Other pot workers have organized in other states, but California should be especially friendly territory for unions, said Jamie Schau, a senior analyst with Brightfield Group, which does marketing analysis on the marijuana industry. The state has one of the nation's highest minimum wages and the largest number of unionized workers across industries. Its laws also tend to favor employees. At least some workers say they're open to unions. ""I'm always down to listen to what could be a good deal for me and my family,"" said Thomas Grier, 44, standing behind the counter at Canna Can Help Inc., a dispensary in the Central Valley community of Goshen. A new study says second hand marijuana smoke could lead to failed drug tests. TC Newman (@PurpleTCNewman) has details on this University of Calgary research. Buzz60 The dispensary — with $7 million in yearly sales — sells medical marijuana. Called a ""bud tender,"" Grier recently waited on a steady flow of regular customers walking through the door to pick out their favorite strain. He said so far, no unions have contacted him. Grier gets along with his boss and said he doesn't want to pay union dues for help ironing out workplace disputes. But he hasn't discounted the possibility of joining. After recently entering the marijuana industry, Los Angeles resident Richard Rodriguez said one sticky traffic stop three months ago converted him into a ""hard core"" Teamster. He'd never been in a union until this year. Rodriguez said an officer pulled him over delivering a legal shipment of pot and detained him for 12 hours as he was accused of following too closely behind a semi-truck. A union lawyer stepped in, and Rodriguez said he was released without being arrested or given a ticket. ""Most companies can't or are unwilling to do that,"" he said, ""because employees are easily replaced.""

(Photo: Mary Lou Knurek, AP) KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii — A Hawaii woman is waiting to hear back from Guinness World Records to find out if the 5-pound avocado she snagged is the world’s largest. Pamela Wang of the Big Island found the avocado Sunday while on a walk, West Hawaii Today reported. “I see avocados every day and I pick up avocados every day, but this one. it was hard to miss,” Wang said. “It was as big as my head.” Her next move was to go to the Pure Kona Green Market, where she met up with friends and showed the enormous avocado to community members. Wang’s friends began making inquiries online, uncovering information that indicated that the avocado might just be the largest on record. Wang submitted an application to Guinness and expects to hear back within two months. She had Ken Love, executive director of Hawaii Tropical Fruit Growers, witness the avocado’s weighing. Guinness requires an expert to be present. “I’ve seen (avocados) longer and I’ve seen them fatter, but not both,” said Love, who verified the fruit’s weight at 5.23 pounds. “I think people have other ones that they don’t weigh, but I think this one, it was way up there.” Elizabeth Montoya, assistant public relations manager with Guinness World Records America, Inc., wrote that the company doesn’t have a category for the largest avocado. It does, however, have one for the heaviest. Montoya said that in January 2009, Guinness verified an avocado submitted by Gabriel Ramirez Nahim of Caracas, Venezuela, which weighed in at 4 pounds, 13.2 ounces. Wang said she found the avocado under a tree that hangs over a street. Anything overhanging or dropped outside of a private property line is free for anyone to claim.

66,FOCUS-Sime Darby's Africa ambitions stall pending new deforestation rules,"When Malaysia's biggest plantation company Sime Darby leased 220,000 hectares of lush forest in northwest Liberia in 2009, executives said they had found a much needed new frontier in global palm oil development.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palmoil-sime-darby-africa/sime-darbys-africa-ambitions-stall-pending-new-deforestation-rules-idUSKCN1FY054,2018-02-14T01:17:35Z,"GBAH, Liberia/KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - When Malaysia’s biggest plantation company Sime Darby leased 220,000 hectares of lush forest in northwest Liberia in 2009, executives said they had found a much needed new frontier in global palm oil development. Undulating hills, a tropical climate and plenty of untouched land made the West African country’s interior ideal for palm oil growers running out of room in Southeast Asia. Nine years later, however, Sime Darby Plantation has planted only 10,000 hectares in Liberia and has not laid a seed in two years, stalled by uncertainties over new environmental standards. “We are losing money. We have to balance our books or there is no future,” said David Parker, the head of Sime Darby Plantations in Liberia. In its earnings report for the financial year ending in June 2017, Sime Darby said it had filed a 202 million ringgit ($51.3 million) impairment - a permanent reduction in the value of the asset - on its Liberia operations. The operations were “affected by a number of factors, including the Ebola outbreak and more stringent environmental plans that have stalled expansion since 2014”, it said. The $62 billion palm oil industry is considering whether to adopt new “no deforestation” rules for an oil found on supermarket shelves across the world, from cooking oil to snack food and soups to soaps. The rules mark a more environmentally friendly form of palm oil development, but leave producers with a major conundrum: how to meet growing demand and make money with so much land now potentially off limits. PLANTING PAUSE The debate is unfolding at the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), an industry watchdog that consists of planters, companies and NGOs. While awaiting those rules, Sime Darby has stopped planting palm in Liberia, Parker said. Singapore-listed Olam International in Gabon has also paused development on all but grassland areas until the rules are published, said Ranveer Chauhan, its managing director of edible oils. But back at corporate headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, Sime says it is trying out a new method using satellite data to measure a forest’s carbon content so it can tell exactly how much land it can and cannot develop. “A new plan for land development in Liberia is currently being prepared following the completion of these trials,” Sime’s chief sustainability officer Simon Lord told Reuters. Darrel Webber, chief executive officer at the RSPO secretariat in Malaysia, said he cannot comment with the review under way “and no conclusive decisions on the changes have been made yet”. The rules are expected to come to a vote at RSPO’s annual meeting in November. Concerns about the amount of forests and peatlands cleared for plantations - and the greenhouse gases that are then emitted into the atmosphere - have plagued the palm oil industry for years. Over the past decade, consumer activist groups have pressed big palm oil buyers such as Pepsico, Unilever and Nestle with supermarket boycotts and other protests over palm oil’s perceived links to climate change.

REUTERS/Thierry Gouegnon Many companies are willing to pay a premium price for palm oil labelled with a valued RSPO sustainability certificate. The new rules will decide if land can be cleared for palm based on its carbon content. A dense forest might hold up to 150 tonnes of carbon per hectare, grassland about 35 tonnes. If the RSPO decides an area holding above 100 tonnes an hectare is off limits, then Sime Darby may be unable to develop most of its Liberia concession, said Ahmad Rifqi, Sime Darby’s manager of plantation sustainability in Liberia. “Almost all here is over 100 tonnes per hectare. The only low-carbon areas are farmlands already cultivated by local communities,” he said. FEW ‘GREENFIELD’ EXPANSIONS Sime Darby boasts of being the world’s biggest producer of sustainable palm oil. It has an online “dashboard” displaying information about its supply chain and compliance with RSPO rules. It’s land bank of nearly 990,000 hectares, an area larger than Puerto Rico, makes it the world’s largest palm plantation firm by land size. The Liberia concessions account for over a fifth of that. With governments and companies under increasing pressure to adhere to higher deforestation standards, “greenfield” expansions in Southeast Asia have become uncommon, says Ivy Ng, regional head of plantations research at CIMB Investment Bank in Kuala Lumpur. “In recent years, company expansion is largely via buying stakes of other companies,” Ng said. Sime Darby’s only major expansion in Southeast Asia since its 2007 merger with two other large plantation firms has been its acquisition of New Britain Palm Oil in Papua New Guinea in 2015. Oil palm originated in West Africa and was used there for thousands of years. And with global demand growing by an average 5 percent a year, growers had looked to Africa to expand. Yet production in Africa has grown by less than 4 percent since 2012, compared to around 18.5 percent for Southeast Asia and globally. Latin America is now the number two producing region. CASCADE OF TROUBLES From a watchtower on Sime Darby’s Liberian plantation, low lines of palm can be seen trailing to the horizon, a duller green than the natural forest canopy that towers above the concession’s edge. The serene view belies a cascade of troubles. Local residents, who claimed Sime had encroached on community ands, set up roadblocks to halt workers and stole keys from bulldozers, community leaders and workers told Reuters. Sime says the land came from a government concession. But to appease residents, it built schools and offers free medical services to workers and their families. Its own ambitions, meanwhile, have shrunk. A new mill that doesn’t have enough fruit to press into oil to run at full capacity and crop theft by local residents costs the company about 20 percent of its harvest in some areas, Parker said. Sime hopes to plant another 10,000 hectares once it can show the first 10,000 are profitable, Parker said. “Sime Darby is committed to the long term - if we can make a profit on the first 10,000 hectares.” Reporting By Edward McAllister in GBAH, Liberia and Emily Chow in Kuala Lumpur",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A stunning $1-trillion (U.S.) in capital – nearly double the amount available in 2012 – is sitting on the sidelines, waiting to be put to work by private equity investors across the globe. So many firms are chasing deals that it is creating the most competitive investment climate in more than a decade. In addition to that heap of cash, hundreds of billions of dollars are piling up in funds devoted to other private asset classes. Some of it is destined for infrastructure projects, such as roads, power lines and airports; some of it will be used to buy up real estate, invest in private debt or scoop up timberland or other natural resources. And the fundraising hasn't stopped. At the start of 2018, there were 3,484 private capital funds courting investors for yet more money, according to alternative asset data firm Preqin. Story continues below advertisement It's enough to remind some people of the exuberant mood right before the financial crisis, when 12 of the largest 15 corporate leveraged buyouts ever were done – not long before the industry, and the global economy, were sideswiped by the end of easy credit. ""There are some ingredients of 2007,"" said Simon Marc, the London-based head of private equity at PSP Investments, which invests about $140-billion on behalf of federal government workers, including the RCMP. He said the environment has private equity firms caught between the lure to sell assets and the pull to buy them. On one hand, it's hard to ignore a red-hot market in which where prices often exceed expectations. On the other, strong economic and market conditions have led to robust profits across a large number of industries, creating a compelling case for holding, or making new, investments. ""We're going to be very cautious, very selective about what we do,"" Mr. Marc said. ""But we can't be sitting on the side doing nothing, either."" For many of Canada's private-market investors – which include the major pension funds, insurance companies and other players such as Onex Corp. and Brookfield Asset Management Inc. – there's more at stake than ever before. Over the past decade, the big Canadian funds have gotten bigger, gaining the clout necessary to compete with the world's richest players in private investments. But having a spot at an increasingly crowded investment table presents a new test. Failing would be costly. The last time the buyout market collapsed, the list of casualties was long. Well-respected, high-profile firms were left holding the bag as deals completed at the fevered peak of the market went bad. The TXU Monticello Steam Electric Station power plant near Mt. Pleasant, Tex. on Feb. 26, 2007. MIKE STONE/REUTERS The biggest leveraged buyout of the time, the $45-billion acquisition of Texas utility TXU Corp. in 2007 by a group that included KKR &amp; Co., TPG Capital Management and an arm of Goldman Sachs, turned out to be a spectacular flop. The company, renamed Energy Future Holdings, struggled with falling natural gas prices and a declining retail franchise. Drowning in red ink and $42-billion of debt, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2014.

Canadians will remember the one that got away: the $51-billion (Canadian) takeout of BCE Inc. by a group led by Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan. The peak of hubris for the era, the debt-financed deal collapsed in the crisis of late 2008 following months of uncertainty and drama about the ability of banks to put up the financing. The 2008 collapse of a $51-billion takeout of BCE was the peak of hubris for the era. Chris Young/The Canadian Press A decade on, it has become a world of monsters again – monster funds pursuing massive deals. Fundraising for the largest-ever private-equity fund, Apollo Investment Fund IX, closed in the third quarter of 2017, garnering $24.7-billion (U.S.). Others funds are on track to surpass that amount, including China Structural Reform Fund and China State-Owned Capital Venture Investment Fund. The key questions now are where all of this money will get invested, and how can that cash earn solid returns in a global market where asset values – from corporations to public infrastructure to real estate – are already seen as bloated. Some funds, particularly in the U.S., have opted to park money in exchange-traded funds while waiting for markets to cool and better targets to emerge. ""Valuations are obviously very stretched in many ways around the world. But that doesn't necessarily precipitate a downturn,"" said Mark Machin, CEO of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. He said the fund is constantly running stress tests to see how its investments would hold up under more difficult economic conditions. Asset prices have soared because of a decade of cheap money, thanks to post-crisis policies of the world's major central banks. Public equity markets in many countries, particularly the United States, now look frothy; that is fuelling inflation in private assets, too. In an early 2017 report, Bain &amp; Co. said acquisition multiples are hitting record highs across the US and Europe, at more than 10 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. A more recent report from data platform Pitchbook showed that deal multiples for M&amp;A activity in North America had climbed to the highest levels they'd ever recorded.

""Despite what they think is an over-aggressive bid on their own part – they almost push their boards to nosebleed levels, only to discover that somebody was more aggressive than they were."" CPPIB's Mr. Machin said it will be important to be ready to pounce when things become less expensive. ""When there's a downturn, that should be the moment when we're making really good investments at really compelling prices. We want to make sure we have the ability to do that,"" he said. How can the Canadians compete and mitigate the risks for their stakeholders? Showing up at the right time with a padded wallet isn't enough anymore. It's time to get creative. Canada's institutional investors are moving to play to their strengths and develop new ways to stand out from the pack. That includes developing relationships with wealthy families in far-off lands, preparing for an energy transition years into the future, shoring up on infrastructure assets they can hold for decades and looking to more niche investments, such as the burgeoning marijuana industry, for returns. Mark Machin, CEO of CPPIB, poses for a picture in Toronto on Thursday, Jan. 12, 2017. Mark Blinch/The Globe and Mail It's not what you know, it's who you know. That adage has become gospel for some of the country's largest investors of late. As a response to the competitive deal environment, and in an effort to earn higher returns, institutions are building up leadership teams and hiring more deal hunters with experience in far-off places. CPPIB has hubs in Sao Paulo and Mumbai and its CEO, Mr. Machin, spent about 20 years working in Asia-Pacific markets before taking the top job. PSP Investments officially opened a London office this year and is already eyeing its next Hong Kong outpost. Brookfield has been putting more capital into India, where its infrastructure team sees more opportunity in the telecom sector. The strategy runs far deeper than simply putting boots on the ground. Rather than waiting around to bid at competitive auctions, some Canadian funds are patiently and quietly courting wealthy families overseas as a way to source unique investment opportunities. This style of deal-making often involves years of meetings to establish trust between family-owned businesses and would-be partners before any deal is inked. But once forged, these blue-chip family relationships can open the door to new webs of private investor contacts across Europe and Asia, as well as opportunities outside the competitive auction circuit. Wooing these foreign families has become a more important strategy for some pension funds in recent years. They argue that they can be better partners of family offices than traditional private equity firms because of their long-dated investment horizons, comfort with minority ownership positions and friendlier management cultures. ""It's like a private club … It's a different network from the mainstream financial investment network,"" said Stéphane Etroy, London-based head of private equity at Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec on a recent trip to Toronto. The Caisse employs teams of people specifically responsible for building relationships with governments, entrepreneurs and other leaders in their local markets where they speak the language. Mr. Etroy says that once you do a deal with a family you become a part of the group. In the United States and Britain, there are fewer opportunities to partner with families, since markets are more mature. This has resulted in fewer and less active family funds, investors say. In continental Europe, however, the fragmentation of the countries and cultures has yielded more such ownership, particularly industrial businesses. And in Asia, India and China in particular, there has been a surge of wealthy first-generation entrepreneurs, according to the Asia Pacific Centre for Family Business Excellence run by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which opened the consulting centre in 2016. Many of these business owners are motivated to leave a legacy and find the long-term approach taken by pension funds to be more palatable than the model used by other private equity buyers, Mr. Etroy said. Earlier this year, the Caisse took a 40 per cent stake in Sebia SA, a French medical diagnostic company, that Mr. Etroy said was emblematic of the partnerships the fund looks for. The deal involved bringing in Tethys Invest, an investment fund controlled by the Bettencourt-Meyers family of France, and Caisse CEO Michael Sabia flew to Paris himself to strengthen the bond. ""We think we could potentially be doing more things together,"" Mr. Etroy said of the relationship. Many of the deals struck with families are less threatening than minority ownership positions in businesses with no planned exit. Where the Caisse may hold a standard private equity position for about three or four years, many of the family deals last well more than a decade. Other pension funds are also building out their relationship teams. Last year, the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan launched a department responsible for developing global investment relationships that will co-ordinate the many partnerships the fund has forged through its investment deals around the world. The fund's CEO, Ron Mock, said it's ""intended to be the building of a network."" While Canada's big investors are looking abroad for deals, others international buyers are gravitating to Canada in their hunt for investment opportunities, even if their targets are typically smaller. ""You've got a lot more foreign funds recognizing Canada for mid-market companies, particularly U.S. funds,"" said Jake Bullen, a lawyer for Cassels Brock &amp; Blackwell LLP specializing in private equity deals. ""You've got all that interest, you've got a lot of dry powder and the result is a very competitive market for good companies."" Increasing interest in Canada among U.S. funds has its benefits – it can mean opportunity for domestic players to sell businesses at healthy valuations when the time is right, said Brent Belzberg, founder of TorQuest Partners. Torquest sold a majority stake in SCM Insurance Services to U.S.-based Warburg Pincus in August. In 2015, it sold store-display and merchandising company Array Marketing to The Carlyle Group. ""We have an amazing business in basically creating an arbitrage between the time that businesses we know through our relationships in Canada can be built and when we get them mature enough that they can be put into a book and sold through major world-class investment bankers to people who don't see the border as an impediment,"" Mr. Belzberg said. Brookfield is buying Westinghouse Electric, a nuclear energy company, from Toshiba. Canadian private equity is funding a lot of the shift to renewable energy. Brookfield Asset Management is one of the world's largest investors in the sector, with a major focus on hydro power and holdings in wind and solar. On Thursday, it announced it was leading a $4.6-billion bid to buy Westinghouse Electric Co., the struggling nuclear power giant, from Japan's Toshiba Corp., which was another departure from carbon-intensive power. The Caisse has also been boosting already-large investments, with a recent $150-million (Canadian) loan to Innergex Renewable Energy Inc. and the purchase of a $288-million stake in Boralex Inc., which operates wind, solar and hydro projects in Canada, France and the United States. The renewable-energy industry, estimated to be worth as much as $300-billion (U.S.) annually, is becoming a magnet as governments in Canada and elsewhere tighten carbon-emissions regulations, and as the fossil fuel industry exits the third year of a downturn that has caused a major shakeout of investors in both public and private markets. The difference between today's cleantech world and the one that existed 10 years ago is that it now has the ability to generate real returns without massive government subsidies, said Tom Rand, managing director of ArcTern Ventures, which invests in companies bringing in new technology to aid the integration of renewables into today's energy systems. The trick for private investors is identifying the technologies that will allow them to get first-mover advantage before crowds of investors show up to fund major expansion. ""The economy's changing. Some people just haven't figured this out yet. We're moving to a low-carbon economy come hell or high water. Those who understand that's inevitable are starting to figure out, how do I put some money in play to give me an advantage as that transition occurs?"" Mr. Rand said. ""They're busy buying their way to the front of the line to finance those types of projects."" Today's biggest breakthroughs are in technology that allows the grid to operate with increasing amounts of renewable power. They mesh well with the major investments being made by the largest pension and private-equity funds. ""So that's where the Brookfields and so on of the world are creating a market for us – not simply more solar, but smart grid, energy storage, power electronics – all the stuff that comes in later,"" he said. ArcTern has co-invested with such diverse players as the Kuwaiti Investment Authority, Enbridge Inc. and Canoe Financial and expects to close a new $150-million (Canadian) cleantech fund this month. A Brookfield Infrastructure deep-lake cooling pipeline project near Toronto. Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP It's not enough to be a world leader in owning and operating toll roads, bridges and power lines anymore – Canada's top investors in infrastructure have been forced to become more inventive. Two decades ago, infrastructure was just coming alive as an asset class. Governments in developed economies began to change their thinking on public works projects and became more comfortable with offloading some responsibility to the private sector. This trend accelerated after the financial crisis, as cash-strapped governments looked further afield for financial partners. Big investors stepped up, drawn to the fact that infrastructure investing tends to have less competition, lower volatility, inflation protection and longer-term holding periods than other assets. Canadian funds were big buyers and are now known for their expertise. It's a good place to be, given that governments around the world are building at a record pace and the need for capital to fund construction and maintenance of critical infrastructure is high. But also rising is the amount of money that flooded into the asset class in the wake of the financial crisis. Cash available to be spent by fund managers stands at a record $160-billion, according to Preqin Ltd., which tracks private equity deals and fundraising. ""There are clearly some asset classes that, given extremely low interest rates and what would seem to be unending sources of capital to pursue investment … have probably been chased pretty aggressively,"" says Mr. Rothney of Barclays, citing infrastructure as a key example. ""And therefore the valuations have become quite lofty and returns quite difficult."" Last year was a banner year for infrastructure funds. New York-based investment firm Global Infrastructure Partners set a record when it secured $15.8-billion (U.S.) in capital commitments for its latest fund. All that competition is putting pressure on the returns that can be earned through typical infrastructure building, while encouraging experienced players to move up the risk spectrum, or specialize in unique holdings. Case in point: Brookfield's infrastructure group, which was founded just 10 years ago and now manages $41-billion in assets. The firm is looking to some new strategies to spur growth this year, including the launch of its first infrastructure debt fund. It bested its target of $700-million by raising $885-million right out of the gate. Infrastructure debt would be attractive to pension funds and insurers because of their long-dated contractual cash flows backed by secure infrastructure assets. It's not the only way that the Brookfield team has sought to stand out. The firm also has a backlog of capital projects – investments needed to maintain or improve its assets – billions of dollars deep. Brookfield Infrastructure Group CEO Sam Pollock said last year that these investments are typically where the business earns its highest returns because ""we're not competing to the same degree as we would an M&amp;A opportunity where we have to go up against a number of pension plans."" And investors are getting more creative with the definition of infrastructure. At Brookfield, a big theme for the coming decade is data infrastructure. ""Data is the fastest growing commodity in the world,"" Mr. Pollock wrote in a recent letter to his investors. ""This growth is driving the need for massive investment in the networks that transmit and store data."" Some funds have also pushed the boundaries of what constitutes an infrastructure buy. After a particularly lengthy due diligence, Teachers' infrastructure group and a partner bought Britain's second-largest private crematorium operator, Westerleigh Group for its portfolio in 2016, deciding the land ownership element and revenue stream from more than 30,000 funerals each year qualified it for the portfolio. The marijuana boom is attracting a private equity sector, hungry for new asset classes. Justin Tang/THE CANADIAN PRESS With the world's private equity sights set on the largest targets, Canada's expertise in mid-market niches has become a competitive strength. Until the oil patch downturn, the country's massive energy and materials riches were sought after by Canadian and U.S. funds alike. Now, the country is becoming synonymous with other fast-growing fields outside traditional commodities. The cannabis boom making headlines in the stock market, for instance, is attracting private-sector money, too. It's the latest example of private-market investors expanding their interests into areas they previously avoided. The venture-capital arm of the pension fund OMERS, for example, was launched in 2011 and now has $800-million (Canadian) of assets under management. CPPIB invested in the development of high-end student housing and recently bought 24 properties in the United States for $1.1-billion alongside a partner. At the same time, hedge funds looking to tap burgeoning – yet untested – sectors in pursuit of higher returns at a moment when fees are compressed. Along with cannabis, investors have similarly turned to artificial intelligence and more byzantine private debt deals and even bitcoin, as the first cryptocurrency investment fund launched in Canada. Fundraising and investments in marijuana companies – from growers to makers of everything from tracking software to vape gear – is quickly becoming mainstream in the economy. Canada is attracting money and generating deals with acceptance of the recreational cannabis industry as legalization approaches, making the country the first in the Group of 20 to fully legalize marijuana. The market could be worth more than $8-billion within two years, according to Canaccord Genuity. ""I kind of see it as the day after Prohibition. It's the legalization of alcohol all over again, only on a bigger scale,"" said Ranjeev Dhillon, a lawyer at Bennett Jones in Toronto specializing in cannabis and private equity. His firm hosted a sold-out seminar on private investment in the cannabis sector in early November. ""There's a general view that Canada has a market-leading edge and first-mover advantage, and because of that people are looking to Canada as a place to park money,"" Mr. Dhillon said. Canada is already home to 74 growers licensed to sell medical marijuana and more have applications in the works. When Ottawa legalizes recreational pot this year, the industry is expected to undergo massive expansions in production, wholesale, retail as well as commercial property and other services. Doventi Capital, Nesta Holding Co., Cronos Group and Green Acre Capital are among a growing roster of cannabis-focused private equity players looking to capitalize. In the United States, a handful of large specialist funds and large general institutional investors are also showing interest in Canada's weed sector, Mr. Dhillon said. ""As more money comes in you see more people who are coming in from outside the industry – people with backgrounds in agriculture, or pharma or retail, people with capital-markets experience. That professionalization has quelled investor concerns including in the private-equity space,"" he said. Private equity has avoided some of the ballooning valuations that have characterized publicly traded cannabis companies, though some entrepreneurs are expecting to get similar bumps in the value of their companies. To show how hot the market is, the Horizons Marijuana Life Science Index, an exchange-traded fund that tracks the performance of the North American marijuana index, has surged more than 150 per cent since the start of September. ""Definitely on the grower side, it makes it more difficult because the public [licensed producers] are so inflated now and moment-driven that the private guys all feel like they should be getting the same valuation. If they don't get it they'll just threaten to go public,"" said Tyler Stuart, managing director of Green Acre Capital, a cannabis fund started early in 2017. As a result, Green Acre has focused more on ancillary businesses, which he calls ""the picks and shovels,"" more than growers. ""It's less crowded, less competitive, there aren't as many institutional funds chasing those deals. So oftentimes we'll show up on a small financing and we'll be the only institution in the deal, or one of a very few.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The call for participants has a request: “Tell us about your last purchase of dried cannabis.” The prying minds behind the survey are not criminals lurking on the dark Web or undercover law enforcement agents seeking to dismantle a drug-trafficking ring. Instead, they are data scientists with Statistics Canada, the country’s national statistics agency. It is estimated that since 1991, the price of #cannabis for non-medical purposes has been declining by an average of 1.6% per year and had dropped to $8.30 per gram in 2017. How much do you currently pay? Tell us about your last purchase here: https://t.co/3gvvdziEvF pic.twitter.com/qw7OxqzmTB — Statistics Canada (@StatCan_eng) January 26, 2018 As Canada gears up to become the first advanced industrialized nation to legalize and regulate the sale of cannabis by July — fulfilling one of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s election promises — it has had to grapple with several challenges, including how to train police officers to detect drivers impaired by the drug and whether to grant amnesty for past marijuana convictions. And for the first time, Statistics Canada is turning to an unconventional method to tackle novel problems posed by this policy shift: crowdsourcing. It must determine the price of cannabis on Canada’s street corners so that it can set a price for the drug that is high enough to discourage consumption among young users but low enough to crush the illegal market. The statistics agency also wants to gauge the production and consumption of cannabis while it is illegal so that it can accurately track the impact of legalization on the country’s gross domestic product. “If we just entered a number after legalization, all of a sudden the Canadian economy would get a big bump up, and we’d say that it was all because of cannabis,” said James Tebrake, the director general of the macroeconomics accounts branch of Statistics Canada. “But that would be wrong, because all of that activity was going on before, just below the table, rather than above the table.” The survey asks respondents to fill in the price paid for cannabis, the quantity, where it was purchased, the quality of the purchase and whether its use was recreational or medicinal. A table with average pricing in each of the country’s provinces and territories shows a range from 6.94 to 9.52 Canadian dollars per gram. Tebrake says there have been more than 11,000 responses from “honest Canadians” to the survey since it launched Jan. 23. “I don’t know if statisticians can use the word ‘ecstatic’ about the response,” he said, “but we’re really pleasantly surprised by it.” Canadians spent more than 5.7 billion Canadian dollars on cannabis in 2017, with the majority of it for recreational use, according to a Statistics Canada report released last month. That would make the marijuana industry larger than the tobacco industry and as large as the beer industry. The report, which looked at spending from 1961 to 2017, also found that Canadians consume most of the cannabis they produce. But, it noted, the data is “subject to potentially large revisions” because it relies on “assumptions, models and sparse data sources.” For Trudeau’s government, proposing legislation to legalize cannabis was the easy part. Bill C-45, which sets out the terms for legalization, still faces significant hurdles, with a number of stakeholders arguing that the government’s self-imposed timetable for legalization by July is unrealistic. [ Trudeau vowed to legalize marijuana across Canada by July. It has not been that easy. ] Earlier this week, the government’s team responsible for cannabis legalization appeared before the Senate for two hours of questioning. Conservative senators argued that legalization would endanger children, create a backlog of court cases for possession offenses and do little to stamp out the black market. Under the proposed legislation, the federal government will license and regulate a restricted group of cannabis growers, while leaving it up to the provinces and territories to decide how to sell and distribute the drug. The law sets a minimum age for purchase at 18 and allows for personal possession of up to 30 grams of dried cannabis. Those caught selling marijuana to a minor could face up to 14 years in jail. Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana in some form in the United States, but cannabis remains illegal at the federal level. Uruguay is the only other country where the manufacture, use and sale of cannabis is legal. No other country has attempted to measure the size of the cannabis economy before legalization as Canada is doing, according to Tebrake, although he has been speaking to various jurisdictions about how they account for other illegal activities in their GDP figures. In Colorado, where recreational marijuana has been legal since 2012, baseline data for consumption and production before legalization is limited, according to Shannon Gray, a marijuana communications specialist with the state’s Department of Revenue. She said one of the recommendations she often makes to other jurisdictions looking to legalize is to “make sure you determine baseline data for anything you might want to measure post-legalization.” Tebrake said he thinks that the last time Canada’s national statistics had to account for such a change was when prohibition ended almost a century ago. “There is no guide to prohibition that we could dig up,” he said. “That would have been nice.” Read more: Canada’s fix to the opioid crisis: Vending machines that distribute prescription opioids to addicts Meet the Sikh politician who might ‘out-Trudeau Justin Trudeau’ ‘Build that wall?’ Some Canadians are calling for more border control, too",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And it's likely going to be roughest in British Columbia. While a shortage of Christmas trees in the United States is turning into an exporting boon for growers in Eastern and Central Canada, B.C. shoppers are expected to face stiffer prices and a more dismal selection of evergreens. ""People may not be able to buy the choice of trees they want,"" said Art Loewen, whose business, Pine Meadows Tree Farms in Chilliwack, supplies local garden centres. ""There will be enough trees, but they might not get the choice they want."" Story continues below advertisement But for Canadian growers, who suffered through a dark period seven years ago, when they faced a glut of trees from U.S. producers, things have rebounded. This fall's orders were exceptional, said Jimmy Downey, whose family farm, Sapinière Downey, is located in Hatley, in Quebec's Eastern Townships, an area southeast of Montreal that exports 85 per cent of its fir trees to the United States. This is the first year that most of Mr. Downey's sales were finalized many months before workers started cutting the trees. ""We try to run after our clients. This year, it was the opposite. The clients were running after us to get their trees,"" said Mr. Downey, who is president of growers' group the Association des producteurs d'arbres de Noël du Québec. ""It seems to be a really good year. We are selling to the max,"" said Shirley Brennan, executive director of the Canadian Christmas Tree Growers Association. The scarcity in the United States is, however, a concern in B.C., which relies on U.S. imports. Other parts of Canada are not expected to be affected and big chains such as Loblaw and IKEA said they will be properly supplied for the holiday season. The problem south of the border has been attributed to a delayed result of the recession that began in 2007. There were fewer sales, less harvesting and, as a result, U.S. growers planted fewer new trees, which need a decade to mature into adequate size. Mr. Downey said he had been getting more orders from Washington State, where dry conditions might have affected the tree crops. ""You end up with [what] we call a Charlie Brown tree … you only see a few needles and a trunk and branches. It's not appearing green, it won't give a nice smell in the house, it's not marketable."" Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement B.C. relies on imports from the United States as its limited agricultural land has pushed farmers toward higher-value crops, said Mr. Loewen, an executive with the B.C. Christmas Tree Council. ""We've never grown enough of our own and we've always imported a lot from the U.S. That has become tougher,"" he said. His business is growing fewer firs because he can't rent additional acreages any more. He has had to buy more trees from U.S. suppliers to keep up with the demand, but their prices have gone up. For example, noble firs that he used to buy for $30 or less a unit now cost $50 wholesale. In addition to higher prices, he said that instead of Fraser or balsam firs, retailers might have to sell grand firs, which don't keep their needles as well, Mr. Loewen said. In Nova Scotia, booming demand for real trees in the United States has many growers uncertain of whether they can cut enough trees this December to keep up with wholesale demand. Story continues below advertisement The province's Christmas tree industry is large and in the midst of a rebound after going through ""a rough period,"" said Angus Bonnyman, executive director of the Nova Scotia Christmas Tree Council. Increasingly, big-box retailers in both Canada and the United States have been turning to Nova Scotia growers to pick up the slack from large U.S. growers, he said. Whether that will translate into shortages and higher prices at retail tree lots is not yet clear. ""There should be a tree for everyone. We wouldn't want folks to panic,"" Mr. Bonnyman said, while suggesting in the same breath that shoppers buy their trees early. Mr. Bonnyman said there aren't reliable statistics on the number of trees sent to the United States versus other provinces, where trees are commonly given new tags of origin and sold again. Growers in Nova Scotia are independent and often family-owned; they are not compelled to disclose sales data. Even growers who supply the Canadian domestic market feel the pressure from a tree-starved U.S. market. Cindy Rhodenizer, who runs G.A.R. Tree Farms with her husband in Nova Scotia's Lunenburg County, supplies one main client, a big-box retailer with stores across Canada.

70,Sugar Low: Commodity Plummets on Surplus,"After plummeting 40% last year, the price of sugar has fallen another 23% in 2018, its weakest level in more than two and a half years. This year, major sugar producers are set for record-breaking yields, adding to the oversupply that has dogged the commodity.",https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/05/01/sugar-low-commodity-plummets-on-surplus/,2018-05-01T13:05:28Z,"“Pretty much every bit of news coming out right now is bearish,” said Nick Penney a senior trader at Sucden Financial Limited. As the current season wears on, consultancies and trade bodies have been raising their production forecasts. Australia-based consultancy Green Pool recently upped its surplus estimate by 43% to almost 15 million tons. The International Sugar Organization, the global trade body, sees a surplus of 5.2 million tons. The last growing season, from 2016 to 2017, recorded a 2.5 million ton deficit. But now, a bunch of big sugar growers are opening the floodgates. In particular, production in India—the world’s second-largest producer—has piled pressure on prices. The Indian government is expected to create subsidies to encourage sugar exports for the first time since late 2013. The European Union has lifted export quotas that had previously kept a lid on sugar coming out of the bloc, the third largest global producer. Thailand is also adding to the pile with its own big sugar haul. European and Thai supply are forecast to have increased 21% and 22% respectively in the 2017/18 season, according to the ISO. Brazil, the world’s largest producer, may produce less sugar than it did in its record season last year, but that reduction will “barely leave a dent” in the global excess, said John Stansfield, an analyst at sugar trading house Group Sopex. The excess supply comes despite resilient demand. Even as the U.K. and other places introduce sugar taxes, global consumption is set to grow 1.6% in 2017/18, in-line with the five-year average, the ISO said.

The action by Attorney General Jeff Sessions could have damaging consequences for the burgeoning marijuana industry in the six states including California and Colorado that have legalized the drug for recreational use, plus dozens of others that permit medicinal use. Justice Department officials declined to say whether they might take legal action against those states, saying further steps were “still under consideration.” Federal law still prohibits marijuana even as some states move to legalize it. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said President Donald Trump’s top priority was enforcing federal law “whether it’s marijuana or immigration.” The policy change, detailed by Sessions in a one-page memo to federal prosecutors nationwide, came three days after California formally launched the world’s largest regulated commercial market for recreational marijuana. The administration’s action drew condemnation from marijuana legalization advocates and politicians in both parties in states where the drug has been legalized. They said it trampled on the rights of voters in those states and created uncertainty about how strictly federal drugs laws will be enforced. The move raised questions about how it might impact tax revenues in states that permit some form of legal marijuana use. It also created uncertainty for banks, already fearful about business relationships with the marijuana industry because of concerns they might run afoul of anti-money laundering rules. There has been a surge in legalization of marijuana at the state level in recent years. Other states that permit the regulated sale of marijuana for recreational use include Washington, Oregon, Alaska, and Nevada. Massachusetts and Maine are on track to do so this year. The policy put in place under Democratic former President Barack Obama, outlined by then-Deputy Attorney General James Cole in a series of memos, had discouraged federal prosecutors from pursuing marijuana-related criminal cases in states that had legalized the drug. Sessions said in a statement that the Obama-era policy “undermines the rule of law” and told federal prosecutors in his memo to “follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions” in deciding which marijuana-related activities to prosecute. Some prosecutors in legalization states issued statements on how they would proceed. A U.S. attorney in Colorado said he would not change his approach toward marijuana prosecutions, while a U.S. attorney in Massachusetts said he would pursue federal marijuana criminal cases.

REUTERS/Rick Wilking/File Photo The Trump administration’s action seemed incongruous with comments that Trump, a Republican, made during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump told a TV news reporter that the decision to legalize marijuana should be left “up to the states.” ‘DEFIES FACTS AND LOGIC’ California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said his state will pursue “all legal, legislative and political options to protect its reforms and its rights as a state.” He said the Trump administration’s position “defies facts and logic.” Republican Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado said on Twitter that the administration’s action “directly contradicts what Attorney General Sessions told me prior to his confirmation.” Gardner said he would take all steps necessary to fight the measure, including possibly holding up the Senate from voting on pending Justice Department nominees. The Obama-era policy recognised marijuana as a “dangerous drug,” but said the Justice Department expected states and localities that authorized various uses to effectively regulate and police it. Among companies that have invested in the industry, Scotts Miracle-Gro ( SMG.N ), a gardening product manufacturer, has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to acquire companies that sell soil, lighting, fertilizer and other products to marijuana growers. Shares in the company closed down about 2.3 percent. Several Canadian marijuana-related stocks also fell. Marijuana startup companies said they were now bracing for a deceleration in funding. “In the short term, this news will further scare away investors, which will, in turn, slow down cannabis entrepreneurship,” said Nicolas Ruiz, co-founder of Cloudponics, a San Francisco startup whose technology can be used to grow marijuana. Funding for such startups has been on an upswing since Colorado’s legalization of recreational marijuana use in 2014. Since then, the industry has amassed nearly $1.3 billion in private equity funding for marijuana startups, with more than $600 million in 2017 alone, according to research firm CB Insights. The Sessions memo did not distinguish between enforcement against marijuana used for recreational versus medicinal purposes. But his department’s ability to pursue criminal charges related to medicinal marijuana remains in doubt. Since 2014, federal lawmakers have attached language to spending legislation that explicitly bars the Justice Department from spending resources to enforce cases in states where medicinal marijuana is legal.

Undulating hills, a tropical climate and plenty of untouched land made the West African country’s interior ideal for palm oil growers running out of room in Southeast Asia. Nine years later, however, Sime Darby Plantation has planted only 10,000 hectares in Liberia and has not laid a seed in two years, stalled by uncertainties over new environmental standards. “We are losing money. We have to balance our books or there is no future,” said David Parker, the head of Sime Darby Plantations in Liberia. In its earnings report for the financial year ending in June 2017, Sime Darby said it had filed a 202 million ringgit ($51.3 million) impairment - a permanent reduction in the value of the asset - on its Liberia operations. The operations were “affected by a number of factors, including the Ebola outbreak and more stringent environmental plans that have stalled expansion since 2014”, it said. The $62 billion palm oil industry is considering whether to adopt new “no deforestation” rules for an oil found on supermarket shelves across the world, from cooking oil to snack food and soups to soaps. The rules mark a more environmentally friendly form of palm oil development, but leave producers with a major conundrum: how to meet growing demand and make money with so much land now potentially off limits. PLANTING PAUSE The debate is unfolding at the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), an industry watchdog that consists of planters, companies and NGOs. While awaiting those rules, Sime Darby has stopped planting palm in Liberia, Parker said. Singapore-listed Olam International in Gabon has also paused development on all but grassland areas until the rules are published, said Ranveer Chauhan, its managing director of edible oils. But back at corporate headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, Sime says it is trying out a new method using satellite data to measure a forest’s carbon content so it can tell exactly how much land it can and cannot develop. “A new plan for land development in Liberia is currently being prepared following the completion of these trials,” Sime’s chief sustainability officer Simon Lord told Reuters. Darrel Webber, chief executive officer at the RSPO secretariat in Malaysia, said he cannot comment with the review under way “and no conclusive decisions on the changes have been made yet”. The rules are expected to come to a vote at RSPO’s annual meeting in November. Concerns about the amount of forests and peatlands cleared for plantations - and the greenhouse gases that are then emitted into the atmosphere - have plagued the palm oil industry for years. Over the past decade, consumer activist groups have pressed big palm oil buyers such as Pepsico, Unilever and Nestle with supermarket boycotts and other protests over palm oil’s perceived links to climate change. Many companies are willing to pay a premium price for palm oil labelled with a valued RSPO sustainability certificate. The new rules will decide if land can be cleared for palm based on its carbon content. A dense forest might hold up to 150 tonnes of carbon per hectare, grassland about 35 tonnes. If the RSPO decides an area holding above 100 tonnes an hectare is off limits, then Sime Darby may be unable to develop most of its Liberia concession, said Ahmad Rifqi, Sime Darby’s manager of plantation sustainability in Liberia. “Almost all here is over 100 tonnes per hectare. The only low-carbon areas are farmlands already cultivated by local communities,” he said. FEW ‘GREENFIELD’ EXPANSIONS Sime Darby boasts of being the world’s biggest producer of sustainable palm oil. It has an online “dashboard” displaying information about its supply chain and compliance with RSPO rules. It’s land bank of nearly 990,000 hectares, an area larger than Puerto Rico, makes it the world’s largest palm plantation firm by land size. The Liberia concessions account for over a fifth of that. With governments and companies under increasing pressure to adhere to higher deforestation standards, “greenfield” expansions in Southeast Asia have become uncommon, says Ivy Ng, regional head of plantations research at CIMB Investment Bank in Kuala Lumpur. “In recent years, company expansion is largely via buying stakes of other companies,” Ng said. Sime Darby’s only major expansion in Southeast Asia since its 2007 merger with two other large plantation firms has been its acquisition of New Britain Palm Oil in Papua New Guinea in 2015. Oil palm originated in West Africa and was used there for thousands of years. And with global demand growing by an average 5 percent a year, growers had looked to Africa to expand. Yet production in Africa has grown by less than 4 percent since 2012, compared to around 18.5 percent for Southeast Asia and globally. Latin America is now the number two producing region. CASCADE OF TROUBLES From a watchtower on Sime Darby’s Liberian plantation, low lines of palm can be seen trailing to the horizon, a duller green than the natural forest canopy that towers above the concession’s edge. The serene view belies a cascade of troubles. Local residents, who claimed Sime had encroached on community ands, set up roadblocks to halt workers and stole keys from bulldozers, community leaders and workers told Reuters. Sime says the land came from a government concession. But to appease residents, it built schools and offers free medical services to workers and their families. Its own ambitions, meanwhile, have shrunk. A new mill that doesn’t have enough fruit to press into oil to run at full capacity and crop theft by local residents costs the company about 20 percent of its harvest in some areas, Parker said. Sime hopes to plant another 10,000 hectares once it can show the first 10,000 are profitable, Parker said. “Sime Darby is committed to the long term - if we can make a profit on the first 10,000 hectares.” Reporting By Edward McAllister in GBAH, Liberia and Emily Chow in Kuala Lumpur",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The photo showed a shipment of the farmer's balsam fir trees that had been rejected by a British Columbia retailer because they had lost almost all their needles, a common problem for tree growers. ""I saw in his face sort of a disturbance that it's not just about the money, but it's about the pride of being a producer that his credibility is lost,"" said Dr. Lada, chair of the department of plant, food and environmental sciences at Dalhousie University's Truro, N.S., campus. Story continues below advertisement Nine years later, in a discovery that supporters say could revolutionize the Atlantic region's Christmas tree export industry, Dr. Lada and his team have engineered balsam fir trees that retain their needles longer after harvest – up to 72 days. A sapling protected in wire mesh is seen in a Christmas Tree Research Centre orchard in Truro, N.S. on Dec. 8, 2017. Dubbed SMART Christmas trees, these firs can be shipped farther and more reliably, giving farmers access to wider international markets and higher profits. The trees also have ideal balsam fir characteristics: distinctive fragrance, blue-green colour and full shape. ""They're looking at having yet another advantage over some of the competition,"" said Angus Bonnyman, executive director of the Christmas Tree Council of Nova Scotia, which supported the research. ""The payoff is that there will be more excellent quality trees at the other end."" Nova Scotia's $52-million Christmas tree industry is second to only Quebec's in exports, with fresh cut trees sent as far away as the Caribbean and the United Arab Emirates. But the industry is threatened by the growing artificial Christmas tree business, to which many customers turn after disappointing experiences with fresh ones. Farmers hope that Dr. Lada's research will help increase demand for their product. ""We believe that it will mean that some of the customers that we've lost or some of the folks that have chosen not to put up a real tree the past few years, will turn back to a real tree with all these advantages,"" Mr. Bonnyman said. Dr. Raj Lada assesses the needles on a tree in a research orchard in Truro, N.S. on Dec. 8, 2017. The discovery, which was funded by the local industry as well as the federal, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick governments, was celebrated in a recent visit to Truro by Navdeep Bains, Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development. Story continues below advertisement ""The commercialization of this new Christmas tree research is proof that innovation truly is happening in every industry across Canada,"" he said in a statement. Dr. Lada, who is the founding director of the world's only research centre focusing on balsam fir Christmas trees, developed his protocol after screening the local population to see how long they took to shed their needles. He recorded a range from two to 72 days. He and his research team then identified the best specimens, looking for ideal needle retention, colour and architecture, and developed clones in their laboratory from which they extracted embryos. They developed an embryo multiplication protocol that has been licensed to the local industry, which plans to commercialize the technology. Dr. Raj Lada checks on saplings protected with wire mesh in a research orchard in Truro, N.S. on Dec. 8, 2017. However, it will take several years before the SMART trees will be ready to take pride of place on Christmas tree lots near and far. Seedlings are expected to be available for planting in the spring by the local and Atlantic region producers who supported Dr. Lada's research. The first trees are expected to be available for sale, at a premium, in four to eight years, depending on size. As part of his research, Dr. Lada also developed a product that can be added to water to delay needle drop as well as special containers to store and transport Christmas trees. It will be up to industry to market the technologies. However, Dr. Lada's funding – which totalled about $6-million over six years – will run out at the end of the month. He plans to seek support for additional research, including on incorporating pest resistance into the SMART tree protocol.

Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) during a rally last month in Fargo, N.D. (Evan Vucci/AP) With Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve THE BIG IDEA: COLORADO SPRINGS — A Republican senator’s private comments during a lunch with his colleagues helped spur a significant shift in the Koch network’s strategy that now threatens to deprive several GOP candidates of significant outside support they’ve been counting on for the fall. Word got back to billionaire industrialist Charles Koch that the lawmaker, who had received support from the groups he funds, told a meeting of the Republican conference that they could disregard the opposition of the Koch network to a piece of legislation that was coming up for a vote. “Don’t worry about the Kochs,” this senator purportedly said. “They’re going to support Republicans regardless.” Emily Seidel, the chief executive of Americans for Prosperity, recounted that story as she explained to donors on Monday afternoon why the Koch network does not plan to spend any money helping Kevin Cramer, the Republican candidate in the North Dakota Senate race, even though that contest could determine which party controls the chamber. For the past decade, the top priority was ensuring Republican majorities in Congress. They believed this was the only to advance the network’s agenda. That meant a lot of candidates who didn’t embrace their specific policy proposals nonetheless received a lot of help. But the leaders of the network now feel taken for granted and frustrated about the direction of the Republican Party under President Trump, especially on trade, immigration and spending. Cramer, a three-term congressman who is challenging Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, co-sponsored legislation to renew the Export-Import Bank, voted for the farm bill and supported this year’s $1.3 trillion omnibus. He’s also declined to speak out against the Trump tariffs. “Look, if this were 2016 or 2014, we would likely just have gone ahead and endorsed him, but we’re raising the bar,” said Tim Phillips, the president of AFP, a political arm of the network. “We established that he’s an adversary on corporate welfare, actively leading in the wrong direction. … He’s inconsistent across the board on these issues … And he’s not leading on issues where this country needs leadership the most right now.” Speaking to more than 500 donors who have each agreed to contribute at least $100,000 annually to Koch-linked groups at the Broadmoor Hotel, Phillips suggested that they’ve offered to open the spigots if Cramer changes his position on these issues. “To be clear, we’ve met with his team, explained this and lobbied them to change their ways,” he said. The network later announced a surprisingly small list of targeted races it is currently engaged in. There are four Senate races: Wisconsin, Missouri, Tennessee and Florida. And three governor’s races: Michigan, Nevada and Florida. Notably absent are the Senate contests in Indiana, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Koch leaders have expressed concerns about the GOP nominees in those three states. Officials say the network still plans to spend between $300 million to $400 million on politics and policy during the 2018 cycle, though it’s unclear how much of that may go toward electioneering versus issue-specific initiatives. -- It was a shot across the bow for GOP congressional leaders. The goal is to put every lawmaker on notice that they cannot count on Koch largesse if they don’t cast politically difficult votes to advance the priorities of the donors who bankroll the outside groups that do so much to elect them. The show of independence adds another headache for party strategists, who are already struggling to preserve their majorities and have been banking on Koch cash. -- If the goal was to draw Trump’s attention, it worked. The president lashed out at the “Koch brothers” on Twitter this morning: The globalist Koch Brothers, who have become a total joke in real Republican circles, are against Strong Borders and Powerful Trade. I never sought their support because I don’t need their money or bad ideas. They love my Tax &amp; Regulation Cuts, Judicial picks &amp; more. I made..... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 31, 2018....them richer. Their network is highly overrated, I have beaten them at every turn. They want to protect their companies outside the U.S. from being taxed, I’m for America First &amp; the American Worker - a puppet for no one. Two nice guys with bad ideas. Make America Great Again! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 31, 2018 -- Indeed, the Cramer rebuke can be interpreted as a protest against Trump’s makeover of the GOP, at least in part. When the president flew to Fargo last month for a rally, the congressman effusively thanked Trump and said he’ll stand with him “ 100 percent of the time” to advance North Dakota values. He won’t suffer for saying that in a state Trump carried by 36 points, but it’s another proof point for the Koch strategists that Cramer will not be an independent voice for conservatism. (To be sure, there’s also been some tension between Cramer and Trump. The congressman has complained that the president has been too kind toward his Democratic opponent, believing Heitkamp gets preferential treatment because she’s a woman.) The benefactors of the Koch network gather twice a year. At their January seminar outside Palm Springs, Calif., leaders treaded very carefully to avoid antagonizing Trump. The network did not support him in 2016 and wanted to preserve good relationships. But a series of moves since then have prodded them to put their frustrations on the record, including the family separation policy at the southern border, the failure to protect the “dreamers” and the trade war. Koch told reporters on Sunday that he “regrets” supporting some members of Congress, though he declined to name any, and said the network will become much “stricter” about holding people accountable for their promises. -- Part of the calculus behind being more selective is that the network can now invest even more in politicians who have proven records of championing their issues. Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican candidate for Senate in Tennessee, was in the room as Phillips and Seidel briefed donors about cutting off Cramer. Phillips noted that Blackburn voted no on the farm bill, the Export-Import Bank and the omnibus. This garnered applause. -- The donors at the Koch network are also coming to terms with the likelihood of divided government. The conventional wisdom at this seminar has been that Republicans are probably going to lose the House. Some donors said privately that a Democratic House might not be so terrible because a divided government could check Trump’s protectionist, nativist and isolationist impulses in ways that the current House GOP leadership does not. -- Strategists with the network also believe that they might be able to optimize their leverage during an election year when politicians need Koch money and the grass-roots infrastructure that they’ve built across 36 states. Seidel told donors that “lawmakers are frequently given a pass” when they vote for something like the farm bill during an election year because it’s hard in a rural state like North Dakota to justify voting against it. But she argued that, “It’s especially important we do this during election years.” “We can't keep falling into the trap of just doing what we need to do to get through November. That’s short-term thinking. It’s expediency,” Seidel said. “Why would Cramer or any other Republican feel like they need to listen to this network if they knew we’d just support them anyway?” WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin speaks during a news briefing at the White House. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) -- The Trump administration is considering another massive tax cut for the wealthiest Americans through a change that would not need congressional approval. Damian Paletta reports : “[The Treasury Department] is studying whether to allow investment income, known as capital gains, to be adjusted for inflation in a way that shields more of it from taxation. Most capital gains are paid by wealthier Americans, who disproportionately hold large portfolios of investments. But the use of executive power on such a significant change to the tax law would be highly unusual and could be vulnerable to a legal challenge. Senior administration officials have discussed whether to proceed but have not concluded they have legal authority to do so. The move was rejected during the George H.W. Bush administration because it was seen as outside the scope of Treasury’s authority and only attainable via an act of Congress... Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the New York Times in an interview that he was reviewing whether to move ahead if Congress doesn’t act on its own."" (Bob Woodward) -- Bob Woodward has been quietly working on a book about Trump, entitled “ Fear: Trump in the White House ” that will come out Sept. 11. Manuel Roig-Franzia reports: “The hush-hush project derives its title from an offhand remark that then-candidate Trump made in an interview with Woodward and Post political reporter Robert Costa in April 2016. Costa asked Trump whether he agreed with a statement by then-President Barack Obama, who had said in an Atlantic magazine interview that ‘real power means you can get what you want without having to exert violence.’ At first Trump seemed to agree, saying: ‘Well, I think there’s a certain truth to that... Real power is through respect.’ But then he added a personal twist: ‘Real power is, I don’t even want to use the word: ‘Fear.' Woodward, who declined to be quoted for this article, has privately described the remark as ‘an almost Shakespearean aside.’ “While working on the book, Woodward has kept a lower profile than usual, limiting cable news appearances and attempting to stay out of the public eye. Instead, the author has told friends, he’s gone back to some of the signature moves of his youthful reporting days. Late at night, he’s been prone to show up at important people’s houses unannounced to ask for interviews. He’s told friends that it feels like a ‘rebirth.’” Marc Short, then-White House legislative affairs director, talks with reporters outside the West Wing in May.

( Lindsey Bever ) The exterior of North Korea's Sanumdong missile assembly facility on July 7. (Planet Labs/James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies) THE NEW WORLD ORDER: -- Six weeks after Trump declared that North Korea is “no longer a nuclear threat,” U.S. intelligence agencies are watching as the regime proceeds with new missile development at the Sanumdong research facility outside Pyongyang. That's where they also produced the first high-powered ICBM capable of reaching the mainland United States. “Newly obtained evidence, including satellite photos taken in recent weeks, indicates that work is underway on at least one and possibly two liquid-fueled [ICBMs],” Ellen Nakashima and Joby Warrick scoop. “The new intelligence does not suggest an expansion of North Korea’s capabilities but shows that work on advanced weapons is continuing … The reports about new missile construction come after recent revelations about a suspected uranium-enrichment facility, called Kangson, that North Korea is operating in secret.... “ Senior North Korean officials have discussed their intention to deceive Washington about the number of nuclear warheads and missiles they have, as well as the types and numbers of facilities, and to rebuff international inspectors, according to intelligence gathered by U.S. agencies. Their strategy includes potentially asserting that they have fully denuclearized by declaring and disposing of 20 warheads while retaining dozens more. “ Buttressing the intelligence findings, independent missile experts this week also reported observing activity consistent with missile construction at the Sanumdong plant. The daily movement of supply trucks and other vehicles, as captured by commercial satellite photos, shows that the missile facility ‘is not dead, by any stretch of the imagination,’ said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies. ‘It’s active. We see shipping containers and vehicles coming and going. This is a facility where they build ICBMs and space-launch vehicles.’” President Trump said he will meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. (AP) -- Trump said he is willing to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani “any time” he wants and “without preconditions” — a striking shift in tone that comes just one week after Trump appeared to threaten military action against Tehran in an all-caps tweet. Anne Gearan, William Branigin and Felicia Sonmez report : “[Trump] added that he thinks Iran will want to negotiate with him eventually, opening the door to new talks about its nuclear program. ‘I believe in meeting. I would certainly meet with Iran if they wanted to meet. I don’t know that they’re ready yet,’ Trump said. ‘They’re having a hard time right now.’ That was an apparent reference to economic constraints and the loss of potential markets as a result of [U.S. sanctions]. … Direct presidential negotiations with Iranian leaders would be another break with Republican orthodoxy and a potential point of friction with Israel and the Persian Gulf allies … For months, Trump has told confidantes that he’s interested in opening up dialogue with Iran even as his administration has tried to isolate Tehran financially and politically.” Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi has said negotiations were “practically impossible” due to what he described as the Trump administration’s “fierce hostility” toward Iran. “With current America and these policies, there will definitely not be the possibility of dialogue and engagement, and the [U.S.] has shown that it is totally unreliable,” he said. Talks with Rouhani could also produce little in the way of tangible benefits, since Iran’s staunchly anti-American supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei controls nearly every aspect of political and religious life. -- Trump praised Giuseppe Conte’s hard-line immigration views during the Italian prime minister’s White House visit. David Nakamura and Anne Gearan report : “During a joint news conference, Trump said he is the ‘most closely aligned’ with Conte over any of the other five leaders in the Group of Seven nations, which include U.S. allies France, Germany and Britain. … Trump said his counterpart was doing a ‘fantastic job’ in his efforts to curb immigration levels, as Italy and other European nations have struggled to deal with a spike of migrants from northern Africa and the Middle East in recent years.” THE #METOO MOMENT: -- FEMA's former personnel chief Corey Coleman is under investigation after accusations he sexually harassed women and hired some as potential sexual partners for male employees, Lisa Rein reports : “The alleged harassment and other misconduct, revealed through a preliminary seven-month internal investigation, was a ‘systemic problem going on for years,’ said FEMA Administrator William ‘Brock’ Long. … In an interview, Long described a ‘toxic’ environment in the human resources department Coleman had led at FEMA headquarters, hiring dozens of men who were friends and college fraternity brothers and women he met at bars and on online dating sites — then promoting them to roles throughout the agency without going through proper federal hiring channels. Coleman then transferred some of the women in and out of departments, some to regional offices, so his friends could try to have sexual relationships with them, according to statements and interviews with employees … [Long] said he has referred several of the cases to the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general, who oversees FEMA, to investigate possible criminal sexual assault.” -- In his first public appearance in Minnesota since resigning from the Senate, Al Franken received multiple standing ovations and said he has not ruled out running for office again. CBS affiliate WCCO’s Esme Murphy reports : “Franken was joined by three Minnesota members of Congress at the dedication of the new Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig High School on the Leech Lake Indian Reservation. The old school campus was comprised of tin buildings that leaked, were rodent-infested, had heat that often failed in the winter, and plumbing that led to frequent sewage backups. … Repeatedly during the high school’s dedication there were standing ovations for Franken, who for eight years as a member of the Indian Affairs Committee led the fight for the $12 million in funding for the new facility. … [When asked] whether he plans to run for office again, he responded, ‘Well, see, if I say anything there you will put it in the story. I don’t know. I haven’t ruled it out, and I haven’t ruled it in.’” -- CBS has opted to leave in place embattled chief executive Les Moonves as it investigates sexual harassment allegations that span decades. The New York Times’s Edmund Lee reports : “On Monday … CBS said in a statement that its board was ‘in the process of selecting outside counsel to conduct an independent investigation.’ The company had announced the planned investigation on Friday, hours after The New Yorker published a report that included six women who said Mr. Moonves had asked them for sexual favors and retaliated when they declined. … The CBS statement on Monday added, ‘No other action was taken on this matter at today’s board meeting.’ And so ended the speculation that Mr. Moonves would face immediate consequences for his alleged behavior. Mr. Moonves is well known in the entertainment community … Still, the CBS board could face recriminations from consumers and from those who believe it should have taken immediate action.” -- The legal industry often allows those who have been accused of sexual harassment to move on to another job without facing punishment, according to an investigation by Wall Street Journal’s Sara Randazzo and Nicole Hong. “Firms’ sole assets are lawyers and their client relationships. As demand for work from the biggest law firms has softened since the financial crisis, poaching top partners has become one of few ways to boost revenue. Many firms ask about prior complaints in new-hire questionnaires but do nothing to vet the answers, lawyers say. Firms rarely ask partners for references at their old firm, for fear of alerting competitors a star lawyer is in play.” President Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos at the White House last month. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) THE AGENDA: -- The Education Department is narrowing its approach to civil rights enforcement under Betsy DeVos’s leadership. Laura Meckler reports : “The new approach stems from a view that President Barack Obama’s administration stretched beyond the law in setting rules and guidelines for schools and opened so many discrimination investigations that the system became clogged with cases. Under [DeVos], the agency is also moving away from the sweeping notion, embraced during the Obama years, that discrimination often occurs even if the people involved have no ill intent and that schools should be held accountable when outcomes differ by race.” -- Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he was “confident we can avoid a shutdown,” despite Trump’s threats to block government funding bills unless Congress meets his immigration demands. Seung Min Kim reports : “[A shutdown] could be electorally devastating as the GOP tries to show how productive its majorities can be in delivering on conservative priorities. But Trump’s comments inject uncertainty into an appropriations process that had been, somewhat surprisingly, moving along in Congress with few glitches.” -- The Pentagon is expected to take steps this week to start creating the Space Force, even though Congress has not yet approved it. Defense One’s Marcus Weisgerber reports : “In coming months, Defense Department leaders plan to stand up three of the four components of the new Space Force: a new combatant command for space, a new joint agency to buy satellites for the military, and a new warfighting community that draws space operators from all service branches. These sweeping changes — on par with the past decade’s establishment of cyber forces — are the part the Pentagon can do without lawmakers’ approval. Creating the fourth component — services and support functions such as financial management and facilities construction — will require congressional action.” -- Trump’s personal interest in the FBI’s new D.C. headquarters has left the project in limbo. Jonathan O'Connell reports : “For years, FBI officials have raised alarms that decrepit conditions at its current headquarters, the J. Edgar Hoover Building, constitute serious security concerns. A year ago, federal officials had finally decided on three finalist locations in Maryland and Virginia, and Congress appropriated $913 million toward a project expected to cost more than $3 billion. Six months after Trump entered the White House, his administration abandoned the plan … Those decisions, by the General Services Administration and the FBI, were made after Trump took a personal interest in the project, according to two people … News of Trump’s involvement prompted alarm among Democrats on Capitol Hill, however, with some suggesting the president’s business — which owns his hotel and from which he still benefits financially — may have motivated his interest.” Paul Manafort departs the federal courthouse in Washington in February. (Yuri Gripas/Reuters) THERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS: -- Happening today: Paul Manafort goes on trial for charges of tax and bank fraud in Alexandria, Va. Manafort's trial is the first stemming from charges brought in Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, and will be heard in the Eastern District of Virginia. The judge, T.S. Ellis, is a Ronald Reagan appointee and has indicated he expects the trial to last three weeks. -- Mueller’s team claimed in a court filing that Manafort made more than $60 million from his political consulting in Ukraine. Rachel Weiner reports : “Manafort is seeking to keep jurors from hearing details of his years of work in Ukraine for the Party of Regions and President Viktor Yanukovych, saying it is irrelevant and prejudicial. In a filing Monday, prosecutors responded that those details are necessary to prove how much money Manafort made and did not pay taxes on … ‘The government expects to prove that Manafort earned more than $60 million dollars from his Ukraine work during the period at issue and failed to report a significant percentage of it on his tax returns,’ prosecutors wrote.” -- “Prosecutors intend to show that beginning in 2006, Mr. Manafort used offshore accounts and corporate entities to illegally disguise income,” the New York Times’s Sharon LaFraniere and Emily Baumgaertner add. “In 2012 alone, they have said, Mr. Manafort paid $3 million in cash for a Brooklyn brownstone and nearly $3 million for a Manhattan condominium and he bought a house in Arlington, Va. He also shelled out millions for antique rugs, clothing and home improvements including a waterfall pond and personal putting green, the prosecutors claim. All told, $75 million flowed through offshore accounts that he tapped, they say.” -- Rudy Giuliani accused Mueller of acting in “bad faith” in his attempts to set up an interview with the president. Politico’s Louis Nelson reports : “[Giuliani said on CNN] that the president would only answer questions about allegations of collusion between his campaign and the Russian government and not about questions related to allegations of obstruction of justice. 'They haven't gotten back to us in 10 days over our recommendation of how to do an interview. I am sure they are in bad faith about an interview at that point,' said Giuliani[.]"" -- Giuliani's earlier comments that collusion with Russia is not a crime stoked fierce public backlash before the former federal prosecutor walked back his comments. “I have been sitting here looking in the federal code, trying to find collusion as a crime. Collusion is not a crime,” Giuliani said in his original “Fox &amp; Friends” appearance Monday morning. On CNN, he said: “I don't even know if that's a crime — colluding with Russians,” he said. “Hacking is the crime. The president didn't hack. He didn't pay for the hacking.” ( Aaron Blake ) -- “Giuliani also seemed to offer a very narrow denial of what happened with the Trump Tower meeting,” Aaron reports. “While discussing Michael Cohen's allegation that Trump knew about the meeting, Giuliani focused his defense on arguing not necessarily that Trump didn't know about it — but that he wasn't physically at meetings at which information from Russians was discussed. And he did it on both shows. … At other times, Giuliani appeared to say that Trump also was not present for a separate alleged meeting before the Trump Tower meeting in which the Trump Tower meeting was discussed. Cohen has reportedly indicated that others can vouch for the fact that Trump knew about the Trump Tower meeting, but it's not clear he's talking about the specific meeting Giuliani is referencing... Giuliani appeared on Fox News later Monday to clarify [his remarks, saying] he was indeed talking about an allegation of a second, earlier meeting that hasn't been made public — but which he heard about from talking to reporters[.] Asked why he was debunking an allegation that hadn't been made, Giuliani said he was merely getting ahead of the story.” -- Trump agreed with his lawyer that collusion is not a crime over Twitter this morning: Collusion is not a crime, but that doesn’t matter because there was No Collusion (except by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats)! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 31, 2018 -- Time Magazine's Ryan Teague Beckwith has a list of the 207 arguments Trump has made against Mueller’s investigation. -- “A U.S. senator known for her outspoken [Putin criticism] was hit with a bizarre impersonation attempt by someone hoping to get inside information on American sanctions targeting Russia,” The Daily Beast’s Andrew Desiderio and Kevin Poulsen report. “Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) was contacted through her staff last November by an individual who said he worked for the foreign ministry of Latvia, a tiny Baltic nation supportive of efforts to rein in Russian aggression. The man said he was trying to set up a phone call between the senator and Edgars Rinkevičs, the Latvian foreign minister. The purpose of the meeting, he said in an email, was to discuss ‘prolongation of anti-Russian sanctions’ and ‘general security with Kaspersky laboratory case.’ It was a plausible enough reason for a meeting. Shaheen authored the law mandating a government-wide purge of software made by [Kaspersky Lab]. … A staffer for the senator responded to the email and proposed a date and time for a phone call between Shaheen and Rinkevičs. The supposed Latvian official [agreed] …But before the call could take place, Shaheen’s office contacted the Latvian embassy to confirm Vaiders’ bona fides. The embassy responded that the outreach attempt was fake."" -- The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee laid out 20 proposals to combat disinformation on social media platforms. From Karoun Demirjian : “The proposals from Sen. Mark R.

(Shannon Stapleton/Reuters) THE TRADE WAR: -- Executives in other industries are pressuring Trump to extend his trade bailouts beyond U.S. farmers, as more companies are forced to lay off workers because of the president’s tariffs. Heather Long reports : “Extending those bailouts would be an expensive proposition. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Monday estimated the total price tag could hit $39 billion if Trump compensated the losses across all industries. … Critics of Trump’s trade policy are calling on him to de-escalate the trade war rather than try to bail out the businesses hurt by it. But if the trade fight continues and the midterm elections draw near, the White House stands to face pressure, including from Republicans, to extend more government aid.” One stark example: “Jane Hardy, the chief executive of a company that makes lawn-care equipment, says she had to lay off 75 employees this summer because of [Trump’s] trade war. … Hardy’s company, Brinly-Hardy, has been in business since 1839. It survived recessions and the Civil War, but it might not survive a prolonged trade war. Hardy buys steel from U.S. companies, but Trump’s tariffs on foreign steel have caused domestic prices to rise, as well.” -- Soybean farmers have so far managed to escape trade war fallout.

The situation is similar for grain and oilseed crops, as well as pork, which was also hit by Chinese tariffs but enjoyed year-high prices in May and June. … [I]t raises questions about the logic of using payouts to shield farmers in the short term without taking measures to avoid a prolonged trade war. Many of the mechanisms protecting farmers this season will weaken next year if prices remain low.” THE MIDTERMS: -- Rep. Ron DeSantis, a GOP gubernatorial candidate in Florida who has been endorsed by Trump, released a campaign ad in which he tells his young daughter, “Build the wall.” Erin B. Logan reports : “‘Build the wall,’ [DeSantis] says while playing with toy blocks with his daughter, Madison, nearly 2, in his Florida home. ‘Then, Mr. Trump said, ‘You’re fired,’ he says while holding his infant son, Mason, in one arm and Trump’s book ‘The Art of the Deal’ in his other. … ‘The ad is just meant to reinforce the fact that the President is endorsing Ron and that Ron has defended the President,’ David Vasquez, a spokesman for DeSantis, told The Washington Post in an email. ‘It’s just a bit of humor.’” -- DeSantis has pulled far ahead of his primary opponent, Adam Putnam, since Trump offered his endorsement. The New York Times’s Jonathan Martin reports : “Only last month, Mr. Putnam — the state’s agriculture commissioner and a genial conservative tabbed for political stardom since he won a state house seat at 22 — was ahead of [DeSantis] in fund-raising, local endorsements and opinion polls. But then Mr. Trump bestowed his formal blessing on Mr. DeSantis for the Aug. 28 primary. Now, as Mr. Trump prepares to appear with Mr. DeSantis at a rally in Tampa Tuesday night, Mr. Putnam is facing a double-digit deficit in the polls and odds so long that even some of his admirers suggest he should stop spending money attacking his rival and begin pondering a comeback after the Trump era has passed.” -- Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state who became known for his baseless claims of voter fraud, is trying to revive his political career with a gubernatorial bid. Amy B Wang reports : “Kobach finds himself focused back on Kansas, where he spent most of his childhood, and a crowded primary with six other Republicans. All of them must persuade skeptical GOP voters that conservative policies — and perhaps lower taxes — can still succeed in Kansas, even after former governor Sam Brownback’s steep tax cuts left the state’s economy, infrastructure funding and education systems reeling. … Kobach, for his part, isn’t as concerned about separating himself from Brownback as much as he is in showing affinity for the Trumps. ‘Make Kansas Great Again’ isn’t a catchphrase in the state — yet — but he’s trying to make it one with his copious tweets signed #MKGA.” -- Trump’s election has split the libertarian movement, leaving Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) as the only libertarian congressman willing to break with the president. David Weigel writes : “[Libertarian Ron Paul’s] think tank cheers Trump for fighting ‘globalists’ and questioning the United States’ role in NATO. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), the elder Paul’s son and Amash’s favored presidential candidate in 2016, has become one of Trump’s defenders … That has left Amash as the only consistent representative of a wing of libertarianism that remains alienated by Trump — advocates of a government shrunk down to a pre-New Deal size, and advocates of freer trade and immigration policies.” -- “Does [Trump] care if Republicans lose the House of Representatives this November?” the Wall Street Journal’s editorial board writes. “If that seems like an odd question, consider that Mr. Trump is running a campaign strategy that puts the House at maximum risk while focusing on the Senate. … Mr. Trump might not welcome a Democratic House, but he also might not fear it as long as Republicans keep the Senate. More than even most politicians, Mr. Trump always needs a foil, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi would be from central political casting.” -- Hillary Clinton is getting more involved in Democrats’ midterm efforts. CNN’s Dan Merica reports : “Clinton, through her political organization Onward Together, donated the maximum of $5,000 to 19 Democratic House candidates and four secretary of state candidates in June, according to the group's filings with the [FEC]. The donations represent the most concentrated midterm effort the former Democratic presidential nominee has made to date and further thrust Clinton into an election that will be the most potent judgment on Trump since he defeated her two years earlier.” -- Michigan’s Democrat primaries will be a test of whether Muslim candidates can win in the state, David Weigel writes. “Former state legislator Rashida Tlaib and Obama administration official Fayrouz Saad are competing for a deep-blue seat in Detroit and a GOP-leaning seat in the suburbs. Abdul El-Sayed,33, a gubernatorial candidate backed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), has leaned into identity to explain why the party’s establishment is afraid of him. … Each candidate, as well as some progressive challengers down the ballot, is working to mobilize an electorate that swung decisively toward Democrats after 2001, but has struggled for representation. Two states — Indiana and Minnesota — have sent Muslims to Congress. Michigan, with at least 115,000 Muslims registered as Democrats, has not.” -- A congressional race in Virginia has been upended by … Bigfoot erotica? Ron Charles writes : “On Twitter this Sunday, [Leslie Cockburn, a Democrat running in Virginia’s 5th District,] accused her Republican opponent, Denver Riggleman, of being a ‘devotee of Bigfoot erotica.’ Her tweet included a crudely drawn image of Bigfoot — with the monster’s genitalia obscured — taken from Riggleman’s Instagram account. She added, ‘This is not what we need on Capitol Hill.’ … Reached by phone Monday morning, Riggleman said he has no interest at all in Bigfoot erotica, and he characterized Cockburn’s accusation as ludicrous. … He said that he did write an ‘anthropological book sort of based on parody and satire,’ which has been a running joke with ‘a bunch of military pals’ for the past 14 years.” Sen.

But after meeting with him, he opted to back the appeals court judge, despite their differences. ‘No one will ever completely agree with a nominee,’ Paul said in a statement announcing his decision. ‘Each nominee, however, must be judged on the totality of their views, character, and opinions.’ … While many Republicans believed Paul would ultimately fall in line, the possibility that he would hold out until later this year threatened to complicate matters for Trump and top Senate Republicans.” Kavanaugh also met with his first Democratic senator, Joe Manchin (W-Va.), who left the door open to supporting Trump’s nominee: “‘Two hours — we talked about everything,’ said Manchin, a centrist facing reelection in a state Trump won overwhelmingly. ‘It helped me and my staff understand and gives us a lot to work on.’ Later, in a statement, Manchin said he would not make a final decision on the nomination ‘until I complete a thorough and fair examination of his candidacy.’” -- Six years ago, Kavanaugh sided with a Trump-branded casino in a case against the National Labor Relations Board, helping the Atlantic City property successfully thwart a unionization drive. Bloomberg News's Josh Eidelson reports : “Kavanaugh was one of three Republican-appointed judges who in 2012 voted unanimously to set aside an order by the National Labor Relations Board that would have required the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino … to bargain with the United Auto Workers. The casino has since shut down. But labor advocates point to the case... as evidence that Kavanaugh may hobble enforcement of workplace laws and the already-embattled union movement.” -- “Wanna Beat Trump’s Supreme Court Nominee? Focus on Marijuana,” Jeff Hauser writes in a Daily Beast column : “As a political matter, there are few better cards for the Democratic Party to play. According to Gallup, support for legalization [of marijuana] has ‘risen from 12 percent in 1969 to 31 percent in 2000 to 64 percent in 2017.’ … In an environment in which marijuana is salient to the Supreme Court and many voters, the fact that marijuana is not part of the effort to secure red and purple state Senate votes against Kavanaugh is a little perplexing. Not least because it has already proven to be a topic that can compel lawmakers to act.” SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: Trump thanked Rand Paul for supporting Brett Kavanaugh: Thank you to @RandPaul for your YES on a future great Justice of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.

76,FEATURE-Chocolate forests: Can cocoa help restore the Amazon?,"NEW YORK/MEDICILÂNDIA, Brazil, April 12 (Reuters) - For years, Valdomiro Facchi has made a living ranching on land carved from the Amazon rainforest. He's a small player in one of the world's biggest environmental disasters.",https://www.reuters.com/article/brazil-cocoa-environment/feature-chocolate-forests-can-cocoa-help-restore-the-amazon-idUSL1N1RP016,2018-04-12T05:00:00Z,"NEW YORK/MEDICILÂNDIA, Brazil, April 12 (Reuters) - For years, Valdomiro Facchi has made a living ranching on land carved from the Amazon rainforest. He’s a small player in one of the world’s biggest environmental disasters. But now that his cattle have trampled the pastures to dust - and new laws prevent him from clearing fresh land - he has to find new income. “I want to diversify,” said the 68-year old rancher, outlining plans to plant cocoa trees on his 300 hectare plot in Brazil’s Para State. “I want to have the cocoa income when profit from cattle ranching fails.” Facchi illustrates a trend that is turning damaged parts of the Amazon basin green again and creating an usual alliance between the agriculture industry and conservationists. Brazil’s cattle ranchers are planting cocoa on their used-up pasture, with financial support from international environmental groups. That’s a big change. For decades, ranchers have been the engine of clear-cutting in the Amazon rainforest that has rendered an area nearly the size of Spain treeless. Environmentalists have argued the practice destroys wildlife habitat and undermines the planet’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide that causes global warming. “Besides being a means of avoiding deforestation, cocoa plantations favor the local, regional and national economy,” the international environmental group The Nature Conservancy said on its website. The young trees will also bring change to global cocoa markets. Brazil’s National Association of the Cocoa Processing Industry (AIPC) expects the surge in planting to help double the country’s output of the raw material in chocolate by 2028 to 400,000 tonnes a year. That increase would raise global output by about 5 percent. The renewed planting could make Brazil one of the world’s top three cocoa growers again after the sector was decimated in the 1990s by a crop fungus called witches’ broom. (For a graphic on global cocoa production and chocolate consumption, see: tmsnrt.rs/2GzYPF0 ) Conservationists and cocoa industry representatives expect the trend to help mitigate the effects of clear-cutting that has ripped some 430,000 square kilometers from the Amazon rain forest since the 1980s. Fifty percent of cocoa production growth will come from the Amazon, said Eduardo Bastos, executive director of the AIPC, calling the cocoa farms there “chocolate forests.” Green groups like The Nature Conservancy and the Amazon Fund have helped finance new cocoa plantations. The Amazon Fund - which was set up by Brazil’s government and takes international donations to combat deforestation - has poured 17 million reais ($5.09 million) in grants into the crop. Nearly 1,700 square kilometers of degraded cattle pasture in Brazil has been transformed into cocoa plantations already, according to the AIPC’s Bastos. ECONOMIC INCENTIVES Cocoa planting is driven mainly by new limits on the cattle industry that have changed the financial incentives for ranchers. In the Amazon, pasture can become degraded in as little as three years if not managed properly, making it hard to raise a thriving herd without new acreage. Brazil in 2014 passed a law that allows landowners to clear only 20 percent of their property in the Amazon and requires some landowners to replant depleted areas. That law aims to curb deforestation, which peaked in 2004 at a pace of 27,000 square km per year. In 2017, Brazilian Amazon lost 6,624 square km of rainforest. Compared to ranching, cocoa can provide income from a relatively small plot with no need for constant expansion. The profits can be up to five times better, said Eduardo Trevisan Gonçalves, project manager at Brazil’s Imaflora, an environmental group that did a study comparing income from cattle and cocoa in the region. The benefits extend to the environment. Cocoa plantations can imitate natural forests, helping to restore native plant and wildlife species, boosting water resources and absorbing carbon dioxide, Goncalves said. “It is a perennial crop,” he said. “It will stay there for decades.” Funding from environmental groups comes with guidelines intended to boost the ecological benefits of the plantations, according to José Garcia, a farmer in the central Pará state who is receiving a grant from the Amazon Fund. Under the terms, he said, he will have to plant cocoa alongside other taller native species, such as mahogany and ipê. “It is recommended that cocoa be planted with other trees - taller ones - to benefit from the shade,” he said at his farm in Medicilândia in Para State. ‘WE BUY COCOA’ Evidence of the shift is everywhere in the Medicilândia region, where barren pastures have given way to shady plantations of cocoa trees bearing yellow and ruby pods, the fibrous protective coverings for the cocoa beans. In the city of Medicilândia, a low-lying town lined with dirt roads in Para state, farmers truck bags full of dried cocoa beans to warehouses bearing signs that read “we buy cocoa.” Shops nearby offer ice-cold cocoa juice, a thick - sweet drink prepared with the fruit’s pulp. Brazil is an agricultural heavyweight, among the world’s top growers of soybeans, corn, sugar, coffee, and oranges. But it dropped from being No. 2 in cocoa in the early 1990s after witches’ broom slashed its production. In Para State, however, witches’ broom rarely survives long enough to damage trees. The fungus requires moist conditions and largely dies off during the annual dry season. As a result, cocoa tree yields in Para are nearly double the global average, said Bastos of the AIPC. There is some evidence Brazil could absorb some of this extra production: Euromonitor International pegs per capita chocolate consumption in Brazil at just 1.2 kilograms a year, compared with 8.8 kg in Switzerland, suggesting Brazil’s domestic chocolate market has room to grow. Brazil’s processing companies - which transform cocoa beans into butter, powder and chocolate - welcome the prospect of increased domestic supply to feed their factories and lower their imports, but inject a note of skepticism. Olam International’s Cocoa Vice President in Brazil, Kidambi Srinivasan, for example, called the 400,000 tonne per year target “an unlikely possibility” without higher market prices and more assistance to planters in areas including financing, training and supplies. Benchmark cocoa prices in New York are currently running at about $2,500 a tonne, having bounced off a 10-year low of $1,756 hit in 2017 on worries of global oversupply. Other big processors in Brazil include Cargill, which has an 85,000 tonne plant in Ilhéus, and Barry Callebaut, the world’s biggest maker of industrial chocolate, which opened its first South American chocolate facility in Brazil in 2010. For some of the ranchers-turned-planters, the chance to undo some of the damage to the Amazon caused by ranching is as important as the money they can earn from cocoa. “There was a time when I thought: We shouldn’t have come here,” said Elido Trevisan, who arrived in Para to ranch in 1972 and cleared nearly 100 percent of his land. “But now,” he said, “we can do something to compensate.” ($1 = 3.3372 reais) Reporting by Marcy Nicholson in New York and Marcelo Teixeira in Medicilandia, Brazil Editing by Simon Webb, Richard Valdmanis and Brian Thevenot",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77,Enough With the Merlot Bashing: A Wine That's Ripe for Revival,"Merlot’s reputation has suffered over the last decade. But on a recent trip to Napa, our wine columnist found elegant, appealing examples that prove this grape is ripe for a revival.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/enough-with-the-merlot-bashing-a-wine-thats-ripe-for-revival-1524766357,2018-04-26T18:12:39Z,"“MERLOT IS ONE of the great grapes,” said winemaker Aaron Pott as we stood in the living room of his Napa Valley home. On the table in front of us were bottles of Merlot-dominant Blackbird Vineyards “Illustration” he’d produced. The selection included vintages that were almost entirely Merlot—though the front labels omitted this fact. As Mr. Pott later noted, the wine was launched when “Merlot bashing” was on the rise, some 10 years ago. American Merlot remains a hard sell today and especially in Napa, where Cabernet Sauvignon is the undisputed and most profitable star. Indeed, Napa growers have been pulling up their Merlot vines at a rapid clip and replanting them with Cabernet. According to Napa Valley Vintners, in 2007 there were 6,828 acres of Merlot in Napa; 10 years later, Merlot acreage is down to 4,583. “When you go to pour Merlot for people in the tasting room they will actually put their hand over the glass,” said Jim Duane, winemaker at Seavey Vineyard, who makes a small amount of Merlot in addition to Cabernet with consulting winemaker Philippe Melka. Mr. Duane is a Merlot fan. “Cabernet is powerful but Merlot is the one that allows me to express elegance,” he said. Napa Valley winemaker Steve Matthiasson believes that the best wine in his diverse portfolio is his Red Hen Vineyard Merlot, produced from a vineyard in the Oak Knoll district in the southern end of the Valley. The vineyard was once Merlot-dominant but has since been replanted mostly to Cabernet by its owner. Mr. Matthiasson is the only winemaker who still buys Merlot grapes from Red Hen Vineyard, and he has to work to convince drinkers, even professionals, to try the wine. “When we do a line-up of our wines, our Merlot is more expressive than our Cabernet, and that raises a lot of eyebrows,” he said. Anti-Merlot sentiment surfaced around the time of the movie “Sideways” (2004), though the grape’s waning popularity likely had less to do with the character Miles’s avowed distaste for the grape than it did with all the lousy American Merlot on the market back then. There was too much Merlot grown in all the wrong places. “Back in the 1990s people just put Merlot in everywhere,” said Mr. Matthiasson. “There was tons of Merlot.” Much of the Merlot planted in unsuitable locations failed to get ripe—or turned out far too ripe—resulting in wines that were either green and weedy or soft, sweet, boring fruit bombs. A far cry, in other words, from the “lush complex wines that smell like violets” that Mr. Pott described as his ideal. Richie Allen, winemaker at Rombauer Vineyards, noted that Merlot needs the right conditions (humidity) and soil (preferably clay) to thrive. Merlot is a pretty temperamental grape “with a lot more in common with Pinot Noir than Cabernet,” he said. Rombauer is in the middle of the Valley, but Mr. Allen sources much of his Merlot in the southern end of Napa, in the cool, humid Napa Carneros region, which he said “has a lot of clay soil.” I confessed to the easygoing, Australian-born Mr. Allen that I was surprised to discover that a Rombauer Merlot even existed. The winery is synonymous with the big, oaky (and wildly popular) Rombauer Chardonnay sometimes called “cougar juice” or “housewife heroin” by both fans and detractors. Mr. Allen laughed. “The Rombauer Merlot drinker is not the Rombauer Chardonnay drinker,” he said. And his 2014 Rombauer Merlot was no oak bomb, but an attractive, bright-red, cherry-inflected red with good acidity and soft tannins. “Of all the wines I make, this is the one my wife likes to drink,” said Mr. Allen. Duckhorn Vineyards may be the only winery in Napa more famous for its Merlots than its Cabernets. Duckhorn’s iconic Three Palms Vineyard Merlot debuted in 1978 to almost-immediate acclaim. Winemaker Renée Ary acknowledged her winery’s unusual status in the Valley but noted that she, too, has trouble sourcing good Merlot for the winery’s other Merlot bottlings. “We can buy all the Cabernet we want but it’s hard to find good Merlot,” she said. I met Ms. Ary and Duckhorn president and CEO Alex Ryan in a vineyard that’s home to three very tall, very spindly palm trees. Quite far north of most Napa Merlot vineyards, its 83 acres are very flat and not particularly impressive or picturesque, though quite rocky. “It’s some of the rockiest vineyard soil in Napa,” said Ms. Ary. Ms. Ary had brought along several of the Duckhorn Merlots, which we tasted at a picnic table in the vineyard. The wines ranged from a good if rather straightforward 2014 Napa Valley Merlot to the bigger, more tannic and structured 2014 Stout Vineyard Merlot, an intense and powerful wine made from hillside fruit that would clearly need time to unwind. “Growing Merlot in the mountains is hit or miss,” said Ms. Ary. The 2014 vintage was clearly a good one. Finally, we tasted both the 2014 and 2015 vintages of the Three Palms Vineyard Merlot. The former, a lush, rich, layered wine, was Wine Spectator’s 2017 Wine of the Year. “We have to limit people to buying one bottle,” said Mr. Ryan. The 2015 was a much tighter, more focused, less openly inviting wine. Shafer Vineyards has long produced one of the most consistently sought after and well made Merlots in Napa. (They also turn out some famously good Cabernets.) But the 2014 vintage was the last Shafer Merlot vintage, said president Doug Shafer. With longtime winemaker Elias Fernandez, Mr. Shafer decided to stop making a varietally labeled wine and make what they called TD-9, a Merlot-dominant blend. They had a lighter crop for the 2014 vintage, and they realized they could add other grapes (Cabernet and Malbec) and meet both quality and quantity demands. “’We’re taking Merlot and making it better,” Mr. Shafer said. I was sad to hear this news: The Shafer had always been one of my favorite Napa Merlots. I found out I was far from alone when I spoke to Tony Gonzalez, a senior vice president portfolio manager at the Winebow Group, a distributor for Shafer wines. The company sold out their inventory of the 2014 Merlot, 102 cases, in three weeks. I went looking for a bottle and found one left in my local store. “A woman called looking for nine bottles,” said the salesperson I spoke with, who seemed surprised by this fact. Perhaps all those drinkers in search of the Shafer wine would do well to try some of the other remaining Napa Merlots listed below. Who knows? They might even spark a pro-Merlot trend. OENOFILE // Merlots and Merlot-Dominant Blends that Rate High 1. 2013 Blackbird Vineyards “Arise” $55 This Merlot-dominant blend from winemaker Aaron Pott—who also produces the more pricey “Illustration” containing even more Merlot—is a beautiful, well balanced wine marked by fine tannins and aromas of black fruit and spice. 2. 2014 Seavey Vineyard Napa Valley Merlot $65 Based at the foot of Howell Mountain, Seavey Vineyard produces a small amount of Merlot in addition to Cabernet Sauvignon. Their 2014 is an intense and tightly wound wine that needs decanting or, better yet, cellaring a few years. 3. 2014 Rombauer Vineyards Napa Valley Merlot $45 The Rombauer Chardonnay is more famous (some might say infamous), but the Merlot deserves more attention. Sourced from the cool Napa Carneros region, this soft red has a lively acidity that lends a juicy edge. 4. 2014 Duckhorn Vineyards Three Palms Vineyard Napa Valley Merlot $98 The most famous single-vineyard Merlot from the iconic Three Palms Vineyard does not disappoint. This lush, full-bodied wine, deliciously accessible now, will reward cellaring for several years as well. 5. 2014 Shafer Vineyards Napa Valley Merlot $55 This is the last vintage of the much-loved Shafer Merlot—as of 2015, the winery produces a blend (TD-9) instead. This is a big, bold and relatively high-octane (15.3% ABV) Merlot that delivers both pleasure and power.

78,"Pop a Pinot Meunier, Champagne's Dark Horse, This New Year's Eve","Pinot Meunier—a high-achieving, under-the-radar Champagne grape—is turning heads in the region. Bring this uncommon bubbly to your celebration.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/pop-a-pinot-meunier-champagnes-dark-horse-this-new-years-eve-1514473287,2017-12-28T15:04:48Z,"WHEN IT COMES to choosing Champagne, what do wine drinkers care about most? Is it the label, the style or the price? What about the grapes that make up the blend? There may be a few drinkers who focus on whether or not their Champagne is produced with Pinot Noir or Chardonnay, but probably very few who focus on Pinot Meunier, the far less famous Champagne grape. And yet Pinot Meunier Champagnes are distinct and delicious—and in the Champagne region itself, even a bit of a trend. Chardonnay and Pinot Noir have long been the marquee blending grapes of Champagne, while Pinot Meunier has been something of an also-ran. A casual search revealed that writers tend to rely on words such as “workhorse” and “filler” to describe this grape. The latter term is certainly far from praise, but the former accurately captures the character of the grape, a genetic mutant of Pinot Noir and a native of France whose name means “miller“—a nod to the dusty white stuff found on its leaves that someone apparently thought looked like flour. Prolific if not well-respected, Pinot Meunier accounts for nearly a third of the plantings in the Champagne region. (It’s popular in other countries, too, especially Germany and Australia where it’s used to make a red wine without bubbles.) The positive attributes of Pinot Meunier are numerous. It’s hardier than its fickle relation, Pinot Noir, and it grows more reliably too. According to Alexandra Liébart of Liébart-Regnier Champagnes, whose family specializes in Pinot Meunier Champagnes, the grape is “more tolerant of the spring frosts that are common in the Marne Valley.” It also helps that it buds later in the year. Ms. Liébart further praised Pinot Meunier for its “fruity character” and “generous flavor.” The Liébart family holdings are particularly Pinot Meunier-focused with more than three times the amount of Pinot Meunier in their vineyards than there are Chardonnay or Pinot Noir. The Marne Valley, or Vallée de la Marne, is the key Champagne sub-region for Pinot Meunier. Around 70% of its vineyards are planted to the grape; some top Pinot Meunier sites as well as several premier-cru-rated Pinot Meunier villages are located there. (In Champagne, villages, not vineyards, are rated.) Top Champagne house Krug sources some Pinot Meunier for its flagship Brut Grande Cuvée from the Marne, and the grape may account for almost one-third of the blend. Krug winemaker Eric Lebel is a fan of the grape; he calls it “wrongly underrated” and values its “beautiful character and complexity.” But the Marne isn’t the only place in Champagne where Pinot Meunier is planted: It’s also found in the Côte des Bar region in the south and in the Montagne de Reims region in the north, where Jérôme Prévost of La Closerie makes sought-after old-vine Pinot Meuniers and Francis Egly of Egly-Ouriet produces his Les Vignes de Vrigny Premier Cru Brut Pinot Meunier Champagne. Mr. Egly discounted the notion that Pinot Meunier is undervalued in Champagne; he prefers the term “lesser known.” But he conceded that the grape was not easy to vinify and one must employ “great delicacy in pressing” to avoid accentuating the variety’s herbaceous notes and often pronounced acidity. Mr. Egly’s Champagne was one of 10 Pinot Meunier Champagnes I purchased to taste with a group of friends, most of whom were passionate if casual Champagne consumers. Benjamin Aneff, managing partner of Tribeca Wine Merchants in New York, might have been describing this group when he characterized most Champagne buyers as the sort “who may have a house style they like but probably couldn’t tell you much about it, outside the fact that it’s a blend.” Some of my crew of tasters were accustomed to drinking only big-brand Champagnes, and a few liked Champagnes from smaller growers, but only one friend had ever heard of Pinot Meunier. Sadly, his impression of the grape perpetuated the stereotype. “Isn’t that grape really cheap?” he asked. (I pictured Mr. Egly clutching his head.) I’d purchased the Egly Champagne from Tribeca Wine Merchants, along with the Christophe Mignon Pur Meunier Brut Nature Champagne ($50), which Mr. Aneff praised as one of his favorites. Christophe Mignon is an acknowledged star of the Marne whose wines have won critical praise—and yet, Mr. Aneff noted, there are so many competing Champagnes, it remains a tough sell. Other retailers told me they only sold one or two Pinot Meunier Champagnes. In other words, I had to spend some time shopping around. My friends, however, expressed nearly universal enthusiasm for the Pinot Meunier Champagnes we tasted, even if some of the wines had flavor profiles they found surprising or even, initially, bewildering. The grape presented earthy flavors and notes of green apple and pear, as well as a pronounced acidity. “I’ve never had a Champagne that tastes like this,” said my friend Alan about the Christophe Mignon Pur Meunier Brut Nature. “It’s delicious but odd.” Alan also thought the acidity was a bit aggressive—but he enjoyed it all the same. My friends Burt and Julie found the wine refreshing and fruity and easy to drink. (I sided with them.) One of the favorites was a Champagne from Benoit Dehu, a young producer in the Marne committed to elevating the reputation of Pinot Meunier. Mr. Dehu comes from a long line of Champagne vignerons and even worked for a time at Bollinger Champagne house. The wine we tasted was a tiny-production, single-vineyard Pinot Meunier under his own label, the Benoit Dehu Cuvée La Rue des Noyers ($84). It was powerful and layered, a barrel-fermented, barrel-aged wine that was, in some ways, more like a white Burgundy than Champagne. Three other Pinot Meuniers impressed with depth and richness: the 2012 Laherte Frères Les Vignes d’Autrefois Vieilles Vignes de Pinot Meunier Extra Brut ($63); the Egly-Ouriet Les Vignes de Vrigny Premier Cru Brut ($75); and the ripe-pear-inflected, ultradry Taillet Bansionensi Meunier Extra Brut ($52), from a Marne Valley producer so passionate about Pinot Meunier that he founded the Meunier Institut to further the reputation of the grape. The last two Champagnes weren’t entirely produced from Pinot Meunier, but it was the dominant grape (with a bit of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir blended in). The Liébart-Régnier Brut Rosé ($45), a Pinot Meunier-based rosé, made a vivid showcase for the grape’s soft, fruity side. The Aubry Brut Premier Cru Champagne ($45), meanwhile, was an earthy but sprightly Pinot Meunier-dominant wine with a mineral note. “This is very easy to drink,” said my friend Ruth, and held out her glass for more. These wines certainly helped clear Pinot Meunier’s name. They were delicious, distinctive and decidedly different—all the qualities required of a great New Year’s Champagne.

79,"Green Crack, Blue Dream, Gorilla Glue: The problem of pricing pot","NEW YORK (Reuters) - In 2014, as Jonathan Rubin and Ian Laird considered investing in the booming U.S. cannabis industry, they hit a problem: How to value pot starts-ups with little verified data on the price of the weed itself?",https://in.reuters.com/article/usa-marijuana-prices/green-crack-blue-dream-gorilla-glue-the-problem-of-pricing-pot-idINKCN1GR1EK,2018-03-15T11:09:53Z,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - In 2014, as Jonathan Rubin and Ian Laird considered investing in the booming U.S. cannabis industry, they hit a problem: How to value pot starts-ups with little verified data on the price of the weed itself? A recreational marijuana userÕs supply is displayed at a home in Washington, DC, January 23, 2018. REUTERS/Randall Mikkelsen/Files While a smoker may know the going retail price for “Strawberry Diesel” or “Buddha’s Sister”, the sector’s wholesale tier still operates much like a black market because of ongoing federal prohibition, despite legalizations in 30 U.S. states and Washington D.C. since the 1990s. That left Rubin and Laird puzzled on the investment value of a dispensary, a weed farm or a factory making pot-infused candy. The problem spawned a different investment: The founding of New Leaf Data Services LLC, a Stamford, Conn.-based wholesale price data service that fields reporters to take on the steep challenge of cataloguing going rates. Started three years ago, New Leaf now publishes weekly benchmark spot prices and forecasts on wholesale indoor-, outdoor-, and greenhouse-grown marijuana for 17 regions with legalization laws. New Leaf makes money from about 350 pot proprietors and other subscribers who buy reports and custom analytics. It has raised money from investors who want exposure to the cannabis sector without the risk of breaking federal law. The model is roughly based on S&amp;P Global Platts, a firm where Rubin once worked that researches and publishes wholesale prices for crude oil, fuel and other commodities such as metals or agricultural crops. The task is much harder for pot, and New Leaf’s experience stalking prices sheds light on the murky trade of what might be the fastest-growing U.S. commodity, sold legally and illegally for untold billions of dollars. Cannabis firms still deal almost exclusively in cash to avoid a paper trail or because they have almost no access to banks and financial services. Because it’s illegal to transport the drug across state lines, prices and available products vary widely in different regions based on whether a state has both medical and recreational markets and the number of licensed dispensaries and producers. Last week, spot prices for flower in Alaska were $5,496 per lb, while prices in Colorado and Oregon fell to historic lows of $1,008 and $1,166, respectively, according to New Leaf. (For a graphic on state marijuana laws and price differences, see: tmsnrt.rs/2AFalvZ ) Legal pot prices are also impacted by supply and demand fluctuations in the illegal market, and the spread between the two can vary. In California, regulated market prices are more than $1,000 per lb, whereas prices for illegal weed can be as low as $500 per lb, estimated Scott Davies, a California cultivator. Legal market marijuana tends to be more expensive because supplies are more restricted and because it is taxed. “Consider each state to be a different country when it comes to their laws, amount of licenses issued, what the qualifying conditions are for entry into their medical program, as well as what the political climate and current illicit market looks like,” said Nic Easley, one of New Leaf’s market consultants. Easley, a disabled veteran of the U.S. Air Force, said he moved to Colorado in 2006 to use cannabis to ease the pain of injuries. He’s one of New Leaf’s team of a dozen price experts who chase down their market data and intelligence through a network of commercial players and cannabis industry groups, such as the Oregon Retailers of Cannabis Association (ORCA). The data suppliers agree to submit weekly prices anonymously and, in exchange, get discounted subscriptions or other services. LEGAL BUT UNDERGROUND A multi-billion dollar cannabis industry has developed despite federal prohibition, but many executives, farmers and employees are still wary of federal prosecution. Davies, a farmer in Humboldt County, California - a region renowned for its premium cannabis – said growers have historically done and still do handshake deals with counterparts vouched for by shared acquaintances. Davies sells directly to dispensaries, essentially relying on the rumor mill to set prices. “It’s all been word-of-mouth, through people we know and trust who are established players,” he said. But the market in California - which recently legalized recreational use - is evolving rapidly and becoming more like a traditional industry, with buyers and sellers now sometimes meeting at industry events, Davies said. Market transparency has seen a boost from heightened regulations as authorities in states like Oregon rolled out legal recreational markets, said Casey Houlihan, head of ORCA. Under the new rules in that state, dispensaries must purchase cannabis from registered producers, who are required to track their sales and report them to the government. Previously, dispensaries could buy more liberally through a medical marijuana program. The data New Leaf collects is still fairly rough, and the marijuana market has nothing like national benchmark prices or futures contracts common to other legal commodities trades. There’s no real way for businesses to hedge, and price-setting remains largely guesswork, said Josh Richman, senior vice president of sales and marketing for Franklin BioScience, which grows cannabis and manufactures branded products, such as mints, in Colorado, Nevada and Pennsylvania. “There isn’t something where I can sell long or short,” he said. BLUE DREAM, GREEN CRACK AND GORILLA GLUE The retail market is somewhat more transparent, and a pricing service called BDS Analytics runs an online database of more than 140,000 types of pot and pot products. BDS sells pricing and popularity data to retail shop owners. Roy Bingham, who co-founded BDS Analytics in 2015, is a veteran of the finance and consultancy industries. “We knew this data is really invaluable for the retail business,” Bingham said. “There are people in this industry who have been in supply chains at Walmart, GNC and other mainstream operations.” His firm collects point-of-sales data from retailers and lists the details for products such as “Blue Dream” and “Green Crack”. Joseph Hopkins, co-owner of a dispensary called The Greener Side in Eugene, Oregon, uses the data to deal with suppliers. “When vendors come in and say they have x, y, z products, I can go back and look at whatever the going rate is for that product,” he said. Still, the metrics are imperfect. State regulators increasingly perform quality tests to ensure safety, but no one checks to make sure that what someone is selling as “Green Crack” really matches weed branded under the same name elsewhere. The data show variations in demand for various brand among regions. For example, Blue Dream has reigned as the most popular strain for flower in Colorado and Washington since 2014. But in Oregon, tokers favor a strain known as GG - formerly “Gorilla Glue,” until its purveyors got sued by the makers of the actual glue by the same name.

80,FEATURE-Chocolate forests: Can cocoa help save the Amazon?,"NEW YORK/MEDICILÂNDIA, Brazil, April 12 (Reuters) - For years, Valdomiro Facchi has made a living ranching on land carved from the Amazon rainforest. He's a small player in one of the world's biggest environmental disasters.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-cocoa-environment/chocolate-forests-can-cocoa-help-save-the-amazon-idUSKBN1HJ0H8,2018-04-12T05:00:00Z,"NEW YORK/MEDICILÂNDIA, Brazil (Reuters) - For years, Valdomiro Facchi has made a living ranching on land carved from the Amazon rainforest. He’s a small player in one of the world’s biggest environmental disasters. But now that his cattle have trampled the pastures to dust - and new laws prevent him from clearing fresh land - he has to find new income. “I want to diversify,” said the 68-year old rancher, outlining plans to plant cocoa trees on his 300 hectare plot in Brazil’s Para State. “I want to have the cocoa income when profit from cattle ranching fails.” Facchi illustrates a trend that is turning damaged parts of the Amazon basin green again and creating an usual alliance between the agriculture industry and conservationists. Brazil’s cattle ranchers are planting cocoa on their used-up pasture, with financial support from international environmental groups. That’s a big change. For decades, ranchers have been the engine of clear-cutting in the Amazon rainforest that has rendered an area nearly the size of Spain treeless. Environmentalists have argued the practice destroys wildlife habitat and undermines the planet’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide that causes global warming. “Besides being a means of avoiding deforestation, cocoa plantations favor the local, regional and national economy,” the international environmental group The Nature Conservancy said on its website. The young trees will also bring change to global cocoa markets. Brazil’s National Association of the Cocoa Processing Industry (AIPC) expects the surge in planting to help double the country’s output of the raw material in chocolate by 2028 to 400,000 tonnes a year. That increase would raise global output by about 5 percent. For graphic on biggest cocoa producers and chocolate consumers click: here The renewed planting could make Brazil one of the world’s top three cocoa growers again after the sector was decimated in the 1990s by a crop fungus called witches’ broom. Conservationists and cocoa industry representatives expect the trend to help mitigate the effects of clear-cutting that has ripped some 430,000 square kilometers from the Amazon rain forest since the 1980s. Fifty percent of cocoa production growth will come from the Amazon, said Eduardo Bastos, executive director of the AIPC, calling the cocoa farms there “chocolate forests.” Green groups like The Nature Conservancy and the Amazon Fund have helped finance new cocoa plantations. The Amazon Fund - which was set up by Brazil’s government and takes international donations to combat deforestation - has poured 17 million reais ($5.09 million) in grants into the crop. Nearly 1,700 square kilometers of degraded cattle pasture in Brazil has been transformed into cocoa plantations already, according to the AIPC’s Bastos. ECONOMIC INCENTIVES Cocoa planting is driven mainly by new limits on the cattle industry that have changed the financial incentives for ranchers. In the Amazon, pasture can become degraded in as little as three years if not managed properly, making it hard to raise a thriving herd without new acreage. Brazil in 2014 passed a law that allows landowners to clear only 20 percent of their property in the Amazon and requires some landowners to replant depleted areas. That law aims to curb deforestation, which peaked in 2004 at a pace of 27,000 square km per year. In 2017, Brazilian Amazon lost 6,624 square km of rainforest. Compared to ranching, cocoa can provide income from a relatively small plot with no need for constant expansion. The profits can be up to five times better, said Eduardo Trevisan Gonçalves, project manager at Brazil’s Imaflora, an environmental group that did a study comparing income from cattle and cocoa in the region. The benefits extend to the environment. Cocoa plantations can imitate natural forests, helping to restore native plant and wildlife species, boosting water resources and absorbing carbon dioxide, Goncalves said. “It is a perennial crop,” he said. “It will stay there for decades.” Funding from environmental groups comes with guidelines intended to boost the ecological benefits of the plantations, according to José Garcia, a farmer in the central Pará state who is receiving a grant from the Amazon Fund. Under the terms, he said, he will have to plant cocoa alongside other taller native species, such as mahogany and ipê. “It is recommended that cocoa be planted with other trees - taller ones - to benefit from the shade,” he said at his farm in Medicilândia in Para State. ‘WE BUY COCOA’ Evidence of the shift is everywhere in the Medicilândia region, where barren pastures have given way to shady plantations of cocoa trees bearing yellow and ruby pods, the fibrous protective coverings for the cocoa beans. In the city of Medicilândia, a low-lying town lined with dirt roads in Para state, farmers truck bags full of dried cocoa beans to warehouses bearing signs that read “we buy cocoa.” Shops nearby offer ice-cold cocoa juice, a thick - sweet drink prepared with the fruit’s pulp. Brazil is an agricultural heavyweight, among the world’s top growers of soybeans, corn, sugar, coffee, and oranges. But it dropped from being No. 2 in cocoa in the early 1990s after witches’ broom slashed its production. In Para State, however, witches’ broom rarely survives long enough to damage trees. The fungus requires moist conditions and largely dies off during the annual dry season. As a result, cocoa tree yields in Para are nearly double the global average, said Bastos of the AIPC. There is some evidence Brazil could absorb some of this extra production: Euromonitor International pegs per capita chocolate consumption in Brazil at just 1.2 kilograms a year, compared with 8.8 kg in Switzerland, suggesting Brazil’s domestic chocolate market has room to grow. Brazil’s processing companies - which transform cocoa beans into butter, powder and chocolate - welcome the prospect of increased domestic supply to feed their factories and lower their imports, but inject a note of skepticism. Olam International’s ( OLAM.SI ) Cocoa Vice President in Brazil, Kidambi Srinivasan, for example, called the 400,000 ton per year target “an unlikely possibility” without higher market prices and more assistance to planters in areas including financing, training and supplies. Benchmark cocoa prices in New York CCc2 are currently running at about $2,500 a ton, having bounced off a 10-year low of $1,756 hit in 2017 on worries of global oversupply. Other big processors in Brazil include Cargill, which has an 85,000 ton plant in Ilhéus, and Barry Callebaut ( BARN.S ), the world’s biggest maker of industrial chocolate, which opened its first South American chocolate facility in Brazil in 2010. For some of the ranchers-turned-planters, the chance to undo some of the damage to the Amazon caused by ranching is as important as the money they can earn from cocoa. “There was a time when I thought: We shouldn’t have come here,” said Elido Trevisan, who arrived in Para to ranch in 1972 and cleared nearly 100 percent of his land. “But now,” he said, “we can do something to compensate.” Reporting by Marcy Nicholson in New York and Marcelo Teixeira in Medicilandia, Brazil; Editing by Simon Webb, Richard Valdmanis and Brian Thevenot",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We might be at the end of capital's dominance over labour and rising wages are about to put significant dents into corporate profit margins.

( TWTR-N ) There is legitimately good financial news coming from Twitter Inc. for the first time in more than a year. But investors may be overly enthusiastic about the mild signs of progress. It is worth congratulating Twitter for not shrinking anymore. Revenue in the fourth quarter inched up about 2 per cent from a year earlier, the only quarterly sales increase in 2017. And Twitter's forecast for the quarter ending in March suggests that revenue growth is likely to continue.

A tug-of-war between fear and greed in world markets The world's investors are transfixed by the wild spectacle unfolding in the stock market, as violent swings up and down are wiping out and creating vast sums of money in the blink of an eye. One day after the single worst session for U.S. stocks in six years, the losing streak was ultimately interrupted by the time the closing bell rang on a manic day of trading Tuesday. A late-afternoon buying spree vaulted U.S. benchmarks back into positive territory, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 567 points, or 2.3 per cent. Canadian stocks also pared back recent losses with modest gains on the day. But the fears that first seemed to be stoked by U.S. wage growth have now become globally infectious, as European and Asian stocks succumbed to the downturn on Tuesday. At least US$4-trillion in global stock market value has been erased in the selloff. Tim Shufelt reports about the wild week on the markets. Why investors should rest easy amid this market mayhem Bloodbath! Carnage! Um, how about ""mild correction"" instead? Make no mistake: Stocks will one day face a painful reckoning after a decade of easy money. But as the vigorous rebound by the Dow Jones industrial average on Tuesday demonstrated, right now is not that fateful day. A booming global economy, strong growth in corporate earnings and falling unemployment provide plenty of support for the glass-is-half-full crowd. Despite the panicky headlines in recent days, there is no sign a recession is on the horizon, and corporate news has been largely benign. All of that argues against seeing the tumult of the past several days as a sign of apocalypse tomorrow. Instead, view it as an indication that the market's long, happy stretch of euphoria is over. Complacency served people well when stocks were climbing relentlessly higher. But it could easily lead investors astray over the next couple of years. Ian McGugan reports. Five stocks Canadian wealth managers are buying this week amid the market chaos This week has been a wild ride on the markets with Canadian and U.S. markets swinging from positive to negative and back again. For many high net-worth advisors and fund managers, though, it was a day they've been waiting for a while. Finally, after two years of big gains and rising valuations – the S&amp;P 500 was up nearly 50 per cent between February 2016 and last Friday – there are businesses to buy at a discount.

A trusty alternative for stressed out bond investors There will be blood if you hold bonds or bond funds through a cycle of rising interest rates. Frankly, so what? Long-term investors will make out fine with bonds if they hold through the rising rates that hurt bonds and the falling rates that help. All the while, bonds will pay a reliable flow of interest and act as a cushion if stocks should tank. But it's becoming clear that there's a class of investor who has no interest in participating in a down period for bonds. The worst mistake these people can make is substituting stocks for bonds. A much better solution is to use a ladder of guaranteed investment certificates instead of bonds. Rob Carrick explains.

With the ticker HMJR, the Horizons Emerging Marijuana Growers Index ETF seeks to replicate the performance of the Emerging Marijuana Growers Index. The underlying index is designed to provide exposure to the performance of a basket of primarily North American publicly listed small-capitalization companies primarily involved in the cultivation, production and/or distribution of marijuana. Clare O'Hara reports. Volatility Inc.: Inside Wall Street's $8-billion time bomb It was the hot trade on Wall Street, a seemingly sure thing that lulled everyone from hedge fund managers to small-time investors. Now newfangled investments linked to volatility in the stock market -- until a few years ago, obscure niche products -- have exploded in spectacular fashion. The shock waves have only just begun. How these investments proliferated is a classic story of Wall Street salesmanship and old-fashioned greed. In a few short years, financial engineering transformed expectations about the ups and downs of the stock market into an asset class that could be marketed and sold -- as tradable as stocks but, it turns out, sometimes far riskier. Bloomberg News reports. ETFs just underwent a stress test – here's how they did One of the knocks on being an index investor is that you're vulnerable in a fast-falling stock market. Most of the assets in exchange-traded funds track benchmark indexes in which stocks are weighted according to their market capitalization, or shares outstanding multiplied by share price. The stocks that investors push up the most in price can dominate the index. If these stocks fall hard in a decline, the index gets crushed. The inference here is that you're better off with actively managed money, where an investing pro can build a portfolio for you that may not be so tied to the stocks that have risen the most in price. The recent market turmoil offers the opportunity for a quick and dirty look at whether index investing actually has more downside in falling markets. Rob Carrick reports. Why it's time for Gordon Pape to shake up his fund portfolios At the start of 2009 Gordon Pape created several model fund portfolios for various types of investors, from very conservative to strongly growth oriented. In each case, he set a target range of return that was consistent with the risk level. These portfolios have just completed their ninth year (as of Dec. 31) so we now have a good idea of how they perform over a meaningful period of time. Here is how he has decided to change them.

Answer: I own AW.UN personally and in my model Yield Hog Dividend Growth Portfolio, so I'm keenly aware the units have tumbled. They're down about 19 per cent in the past year and nearly 5 per cent since I added them to my model portfolio at the end of September. Other restaurant royalty stocks – notably Pizza Pizza Royalty Corp. (PZA), which I also own – have also struggled. A few factors could be at play. Given the harsh winter weather and the proliferation of discounts and promotions in the fast-food industry, investors might be nervous about A&amp;W's fourth-quarter results, which will likely be released in February. The recent hike in Ontario's minimum wage might also be affecting sentiment toward fast-food stocks in general, but it's worth pointing out A&amp;W's distribution – which the company raised in October – is tied to top-line sales, not to the restaurants' bottom line. Finally, the recent spike in bond yields probably hasn't helped A&amp;W's units, which are sensitive to interest rates. All of that said, A&amp;W is a growing company, the units now yield an attractive 5.2 per cent and the burgers are delicious (the Teen Burger is my personal fave). So I intend to hold through this period of weakness. --John Heinzl Do you have a question for Globe Investor? Send it our way via this form. Questions and answers will be edited for length.

82,Coffee faces a double threat to its existence in eastern Ethiopia,"HARAR, Ethiopia (Reuters) - For generations, farmers planted the lush earth of Awedai and nearby areas in eastern Ethiopia with coffee trees, earning a livelihood from a crop that is now the...",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-coffee-khat/coffee-faces-a-double-threat-to-its-existence-in-eastern-ethiopia-idUSKBN1IA20V,2018-05-09T13:16:33Z,"HARAR, Ethiopia (Reuters) - For generations, farmers planted the lush earth of Awedai and nearby areas in eastern Ethiopia with coffee trees, earning a livelihood from a crop that is now the country’s main export. But the centuries-long practice is now being abandoned in favor of khat, a leafy plant chewed as a stimulant in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. “Coffee comes only once a year. But you can harvest khat twice a year,” said Jemal Moussa, a 45-year-old farmer and father of six who depends on the narcotic leaf for income. “Khat is much more useful.” He said it was in the early 2000s that farmers in the Awedai area started planting khat as its popularity rose and coffee prices remained stagnant. One kg of coffee sells for between 50 and 60 birr. A bunch of khat, while not measured in kilograms, goes for 100 birr. Jemal said by this year, the entire economy of Awedai, a small town 35 km outside the ancient city of Harar, relied on the leaf. Trucks piled with khat head out of the town every 30 minutes, dispersing their produce to the nearby Ethiopian Somali Region and Hargeisa, in the neighboring semi-autonomous region of Somaliland. Illegal in several Western nations, the leaf is immensely popular in the region, giving the chewer a mild amphetamine-like high. In addition to cash incentive of khat, coffee growing is being affected by dwindling forest coverage as well as drought. Farmers believe the characteristic flavor of Ethiopian coffee is derived from growing it in the shade of larger trees - leaving it vulnerable if trees are stunted or removed. And in 2015/16, a drought induced by the El Nino phenomenon - the warming of surface sea temperatures in the Pacific - ravaged the country’s east, before below average autumn rains in the southern and southeastern parts of the country led to a new drought in lowland pastoralist areas the following year. Indeed, some 5.6 million people required emergency food assistance in the country in 2017. “The harvesting is already delayed by three and a half weeks. By now we would have processed 85-plus percent. But now we have not even picked that much as you can see,” said Aman Adinew, chief executive of Metad Agricultural Development, which processes coffee in Yirgacheffe in southern Ethiopia. Yirgacheffe is one of the best known coffee brands for Africa’s biggest producer of the bean. “The coffee is still green on the tree - it needs rain to turn red. We are hoping it comes soon,” said Aman. “But if this trend continues, it is going to adversely impact the farmers and businessmen like us the growers like us and the country.” While coffee is heavily dependent on rain, Khat needs less, making it a more attractive option for some farmers.

83,"Bridgestone hopes to harvest desert shrub for rubber tires in cars, trucks",Bridgestone Americas Inc. is trying to  turn natural rubber inside desert shrubs into new tires for cars and trucks.,https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/02/21/bridgestone-hopes-harvest-desert-shrub-rubber-tires-cars-trucks/359139002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable,2018-02-21T20:26:04Z,"Are you ready for a new wave of 'smart tires?' Goodyear and Tesloop have teamed up to create them! Wochit An external rendering of Bridgestone Americas' new corporate headquarters. (Photo: Submitted) Ever since the first European explorers crossed the Atlantic and saw Aztec children tossing rubber balls, an idea has persisted: Why not make something besides toys out of that stuff? Three centuries later, Nashville-based tire manufacturer Bridgestone Americas Inc. is trying to do just that — turn natural rubber inside desert shrubs into new tires for cars and trucks. More: McDonald's Shamrock Shake drink returns Feb. 21, in time for St. Patrick's Day More: Trump supporters, conservatives rage over Russian bot purge, #TwitterLockOut More: Will rising interest rates snuff out the nearly 9-year-old bull market in stocks? Bridgestone recently announced a deal with polymer maker Versalis of Milan to develop a sagebrush-like plant called the guayule (pronounced why-you-lee) for commercial harvests of rubber. “We’re trying to create an industry that does not exist in North America today,’’ said William Niaura, Bridgestone Americas’ director of new business development. At the dawn of the automobile age, American industrialists tried to turn the same wild plant into a reliable source of rubber but eventually fell short. Rubber tree plantations proliferated in Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia and other tropical terrains. Experts say it’ll be a few years before desert rubber can begin to replace the 44 pounds of tropical rubber used in tires on the typical midsize sedan. But the global auto industry is searching hard for an alternative supply. Guayule bushes at the Bridgestone guayule research center in Mesa. The rubber from the bush can be used for tires. (Photo: Michael Schennum/ The Republic) Synthetic rubber derived from petroleum chemicals is common in tires, though engineers prefer natural rubber for its strength, elasticity and steering ability in specific places such as the tread and sidewall. “The higher loading that a tire sees, the more natural rubber it is going to have,” Niaura earlier told trade journal Chemical &amp; Engineering News. Demand has climbed for natural rubber. But parasites threaten Brazil’s vast rubber plantations. And in Southeast Asia, environmentalists say the rapid expansion of rubber plantations to meet surging demand has diminished water quality. Looking at plans to develop 21 million acres of Asian jungle into rubber tree plantations over the next decade, scientists at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, England, in 2015 told of “catastrophic biodiversity impacts, with globally threatened unique species and ecosystems all put under threat.” A worker at the rubber plantation in India where Sustain sources its latex chops up plant material used to feed cows. (Photo: COURTESY PHOTO ) Now the rubber industry is abuzz with efforts such as the Bridgestone-Versalis venture to find a new rubber supply to ease development pressure in Asia and Brazil. Last year, General Motors Corp. announced partnerships with the world's four largest tire makers — Bridgestone, Continental, Goodyear and Michelin — to develop what the Detroit automaker calls “sustainable” natural rubber. “GM committed to source sustainable natural rubber for all of its tires in the future,"" said Nick Richards, GM product development, purchasing and supply chain communications manager, according to the Feb. 5 edition of the trade journal Rubber &amp; Plastics News. ""While we stated that we will develop a set of purchasing requirements, our intent was that the entire automotive industry will join in the movement and together help transform the rubber supply chain."" Key to transformation is guayule, a flowering perennial in the aster family native to deserts in the United States and Mexico and transplanted to arid Europe near the Mediterranean Sea. In Japan, Bridgestone has made experimental tires of guayule rubber. Pirelli, the Italian tire maker, has done so in Europe. Michelin is exploring the possible extraction of rubber from a plant called the Russian dandelion. Cooper Tire and Rubber Co. is testing tires made with multiple components using rubber from Arizona-grown guayule. (Photo: Provided by PanAridus) No tire maker has yet relied on dandelions or guayule. The industry depends on the tropics for rubber supplying the 3 billion tires made annually. Four rubber trees tapped regularly for a year produce the 11 pounds of natural rubber found in the typical car tire. The same amount of desert rubber would require about 100 guayule shrubs planted a foot apart and harvested once a year, Niaura said. Guayule grown on about 500,000 desert acres — an amount of land about a tenth of the size of the Mississippi Delta southwest of Memphis — might displace about 25% of the tropical rubber, Niaura estimated. Rather than cultivate themselves, most tire makers envision buying the product from growers. Harvesting desert rubber has one notable advantage. Russian dandelions and rubber trees like richer land good for food crops, while guayule can survive on 8 inches of annual rain falling on meager soil, Niaura said. Bridgestone operates research stations in Arizona for cultivating the wild plant. It has partnered with the University of Arizona on research and development. Scientists from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service also have pitched in. Grants such as the federal $6.9 million Biomass Research and Development Initiative also have fostered research and aided companies including Yulex Corp., a Phoenix entrepreneur. Yulex has studied guayule genetics and allied with Versalis to develop a processing center in southern Europe.

The rubber from the bush can be used for tires. (Photo: Michael Schennum, Michael Schennum / The Republic) Efforts now are focused on developments such as using genetics to identify specific plants best suited for cultivation as well as finding markets for the resin and woody material left after the rubber has been extracted, Niaura said. Harvesting guayule was once an ambition in the United States. In 1904, the Rockefeller family, rich on their Standard Oil Co. holdings, helped found the Intercontinental Rubber Co. of San Diego, which bought 3 million acres of Mexican guayule and planted vast acres of the shrub at places including Salinas, Calif., and Green Valley, Ariz., and put in test plots at Picayune, Miss., Tipton, Ga., and Windsor, S.C. By 1906, hundreds of machine tool shops around the nation made automobiles and needed rubber hoses and tires. The desert plant accounted for 19% of the U.S. rubber supply, but setbacks abounded, notably over quality concerns, says the book Rubber: An American Industrial History by Quentin Skrabec Jr. Tropical rubber better withstood high heat. Even after sustained federal guayule research during World War II, when America was cut off from Asian rubber plantations under Japanese control, the desert product never quite caught on. Akron, the longtime center of the U.S. tire industry, relied on tropical rubber, which was less expensive to obtain than ginning up cultivation in the American desert. Forget rolling on rubber, could car drivers soon be travelling on tyres made from dandelions? Teams of scientists are racing to breed a type of the yellow flower whose taproot has a milky fluid with tyre-grade rubber particles in it.

84,Pair of Canadian marijuana firms eye initial public offering,The rally in marijuana stock prices and the planned IPOs from The Green Organic Dutchman Holdings Ltd. and Tilray come at a time when retail investors are pouring capital into the sector,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/streetwise/pair-of-canadian-marijuana-firms-eye-initial-public-offering/article37798407/,2018-01-30T23:31:42Z,"Canadians are five months away from being able to legally spark up a joint, but the party has already started in the cannabis industry, with two marijuana producers planning to go public in coming weeks. Ahead of the government's July 1 date for federal legalization of recreational marijuana, The Green Organic Dutchman Holdings Ltd. plans to file for an initial public offering (IPO) in early February that values the company at about $750-million. The company, known as TGOD, is Canada's largest privately owned producer, and estimates it will grow 116,000 kilograms of cannabis annually at facilities in Hamilton and Montreal. TGOD raised $112-million in the past two months through private transactions in which investors paid $1.65 for one common share, plus half a warrant. Sources familiar with the IPO say TGOD will sell shares at $4 each. They say they expect investment banks Canaccord Genuity Group Inc. and PI Financial Corp. to lead the TGOD offering. A spokesperson for TGOD could not be reached for comment. Story continues below advertisement The spike in the price of TGOD shares reflects the recent stock market rally for all things cannabis. As recently as last November, a study by Echelon Wealth Partners Inc. showed Canada's publicly listed cannabis companies traded at a multiple of approximately nine times their forecast 2019 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). In recent weeks, the marijuana sector took flight, and stocks changed hands last week at more than 20 times their forecast 2019 EBITDA. Tilray, based in Naniamo, B.C., which produces about 20,000 kilograms of cannabis annually, is also expected to go public by the end of March. The company was founded in 2013, and in the past, it tapped federal government financing for medical-marijuana research. Tilray is controlled by Privateer Holdings Inc., a Seattle-based private equity fund that focuses on backing cannabis companies and recently raised $100-million (U.S.) for a new fund. The rally in marijuana stock prices and the two planned IPOs come at a time when retail investors are pouring capital into the sector, and institutions are showing interest. Investment bank Canaccord held its second annual cannabis conference in Vancouver last Wednesday, and drew 600 investors and presentations from 28 companies, compared with just 11 presenters last year. Newly minted institutional investors include a pair of cannabis-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF and the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF, which together have committed $1.4-billion to the sector, with much of that cash flooding in over the past month. ""By allowing easy access to a broad portfolio of cannabis stocks to retail investors in Canada and the U.S., these ETFs appear to have played a meaningful role in the sector's recent rally,"" said a report published on Monday by analyst Vahan Ajamian at Beacon Securities. He said: ""Money is clearly pouring into the sector from across the continent as investors are appreciating the opportunity ahead."" More marijuana-laced ETFs are in the works, with paperwork filed recently for offerings that focus on smaller public and private marijuana companies. The two new offerings are the Horizons Junior Marijuana Growers Index ETF and The Marijuana ETF, which will trade under the symbol ""SEED.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85,Plant Swaps: The Cheap Way to Score Rare Houseplants,"From Chicago to Paris, amateur horticulturists are gathering at plant swaps to flesh out their Instagram-worthy collections—and possibly sprout a friendship or two.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/plant-swaps-the-cheap-way-to-score-rare-houseplants-1528389889,2018-06-07T16:46:49Z,"AFTER MOVING into an apartment together in Chicago last year, artists Lucas Bucholtz, 39, and Alessandra Norman, 28, decided they needed to spice up their lives even more—which was how they found themselves mingling with dozens of prospects in a crowded Logan Square coffee shop one night last week, trying to decide which one to take home. It’s not that they were bored exactly, but “we want to swap for something more unique than what we already have,” said Mr. Bucholtz, who had his eye on a certain fleshy specimen sitting on a nearby ledge. In this case, of course, the fleshy specimen was not a frisky divorcée looking for a threesome but a diminutive potted cactus. Mr. Bucholtz and Ms. Norman are plant swappers, their prized houseplant collection an essential element of their home’s interior design. Unlike a previous generation of swappers, who exited suburban cocktail parties with someone else’s spouse, these traders meet in cities around the world—from Portland, Ore., to Paris—to exchange rare cultivars that will add ambience to their homes. The appeal? “ Houseplants are the great equalizers of décor,” said Danae Horst, who holds swaps a few times a year at her Folia Collective plant shop in Pasadena, Calif. “No matter how beautiful a room is, it will look better—more alive—with plants. They make a big impact without costing a lot of money.” A far cry from the way cash-strapped apartment dwellers once decorated with cinder-block bookshelves, paperbacks and a dusty spider plant in a plastic pot, plant fans today have a varied aesthetic, displaying dozens (or sometimes hundreds) of potted vines, cacti and succulents in creative ways. “I’m planning to create a jungle wall,” said Summer Rayne Oakes, a brand consultant, serial swapper and sometime host. Pothos vines drape like filmy curtains over windows, and potted ferns double as bookends in her 1,200-square-foot apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which accommodates 700 plants. At an April swap Ms. Oakes hosted at retailer Lululemon ’s HUB Seventeen studio in Manhattan’s Flatiron district, many of the 135 attendees arrived early carrying armloads of plants and snaking in a line down the block. “We had a waiting list of 100, so for the next one, in July, we need a bigger space,” said Ms. Oakes, who came home with an Epiphyllum ‘Curly Locks’ cactus to add to her wall. Not since the macramé decade, the 1970s, have houseplants elicited so much enthusiasm. This year nearly one third of the 100 top U.S. greenhouse growers plan to increase production of potted foliage plants, said Laura Drotleff, editor of Greenhouse Grower, a trade publication that covers the $700-million foliage-plants industry. Fueling the popularity of interior verdure is Instagram, where users can pore over 451,302 pretty (and, in many cases, pretty staged) images tagged #houseplantclub, 854,558 photos of #succulentlove and 308,207 glimpses into #crazyplantlady interiors. It is worth noting that long before social media became the 21st-century version of a telephone party line, people who loved plants managed to share them. Suburban garden clubs, for example, thrived in the decades before women entered the workforce in force. “Swapping dates to ancient times, when anybody remotely agrarian was trading seeds and plants,” said Louesa Roebuck, a garden designer whose clients in Los Angeles increasingly request “interior plant-scapes.” Mr. Bucholtz and other Chicago attendees at Damn Fine Coffee Bar last week said the meet-ups also offer a way to make friends, though for Mr. Bucholtz, connecting was easier said than done. The fleshy succulent he eyed across the room had paired up with another suitor by the time he threaded his way through the crowded bar. But he still got a piece. “You can root this,” said the plant’s new owner, handing him a bulbous tip that had fallen off. Like most swaps, last week’s event, sponsored by Plant Shop Chicago, felt much like a party. In addition to damn fine coffee, guests sipped maple cayenne lattes and turmeric-flavored beverages. Depending on the event, refreshments may fall into any category from “food truck” to homemade. Julia Barbee, who in fair weather organizes sidewalk swaps in front of Haunt clothing boutique in Portland, Ore., said, “I usually bring a really nice rosemary corn cake I make with brown butter frosting, using herbs from the garden,” sounding not unlike her 1950s garden-club predecessor. Plant Shop Chicago co-owner Ozzy Gamez and other hosts post invitations on social media using such tags as #plantswap and #houseplantswap. “I love how it’s a way to use Instagram to get people off Instagram to meet in real life, where they can experience more Instagrammable moments,” said Ms. Oakes. Swaps don’t have many hard-and-fast rules. Regifting is usually OK, (“especially seeds, which can really pile up,” said garden designer Ms. Roebuck), and the honor code rules. “We say ‘one plant in, one plant out,’ but I don’t want to be a police officer,” said Odette Pollar, founder of the Plant Exchange in Oakland, Calif., a nonprofit which twice a year hosts perhaps the nation’s biggest plant swaps. In April, 1,055 people (“we counted with a clicker,” Ms. Pollar said) came together in the exchange’s downtown warehouse and parking lot to trade seeds, garden tools, and planters, as well as houseplants. Of course, some swappers are swipers. “At my last one,” said Ms. Oakes, “a person for a minute wasn’t near his or her plants and somebody just came up and took one. Hopefully they’ll get in touch later.” Some organizers charge admission to trade plants for free. Ticket prices advertised in the past month on Instagram ranged from $10 to $35 (for a swap in a New Jersey brewery, alcohol included). Ms. Oaks began selling tickets for $5, “because if somebody pays for a ticket they’re more inclined to show up,” she said. She learned this the hard way, after inviting people to her home via Instagram. “Twenty people said they’d come, but only nine showed up. I thought, ‘OK, it’s New York, everybody flakes.’ But nobody flaked after they paid for a ticket.” Venues vary widely, from a coffee shop in Chicago to musician Hadley Louden’s driveway in Oakland, Calif., where the offerings last week included “exotic egg-laying pullets (young hens)” as well as potted greenery. A few weekends ago, a New York City host invited swappers to meet her under a flagpole in Union Square Park. “I told everyone they could find me by looking for my boyfriend, who was wearing a red raincoat and salmon-colored pants. You could spot him a mile away,” said Janee Nesbitt, a mental health counselor who lives in the Bronx with more than three dozen houseplants, including a rare variegated string-of-pearls succulent she got at the gathering. “I hadn’t ever seen one before,” she said. “I got lucky.” An unusual cultivar can, like a van Gogh, really round out a collection. And a swap can be a better place than the typical plant shop to find a plant with a provenance. At a recent Portland, Ore., event, a jade plant clipping with a tag that identified it as being “from Robin Williams’s front yard in San Francisco” went home with blogger Allison Burt-Tilden, a self-identifying reformed “plant killer” with a collection of 20 thriving specimens. She sends updates on the jade plant’s progress to its former owner, Hannah Humphries, the proprietor of a vintage clothing shop, who acquired the plant about 12 years ago. “I was in San Francisco driving through a fancy neighborhood to see the old Jefferson Airplane house, and there was Robin Williams’s house, with a huge jade plant sticking through the fence, and I took a few cuttings,” said Ms. Humphries. She still has that plant (“it’s basically a tree now”) and is glad its offspring went to a good home: “I like to think of Robin Williams’s plants being out in the world.” Then there are the ones that got away. “Last year I happened to be in Paris at the same time some Instagram friends were organizing a plant swap and I saw these little succulents called Crassula ‘Buddha’s Temple’ that I’d never seen. I really wanted one,” said Darryl Cheng, the Toronto founder of the blog House Plant Journal. “But I could only snap a photo, because the rules for bringing plants from another country are as strict as for bringing alcohol and cigarettes.” The experience hooked Mr. Cheng on swaps, however. Back in Toronto, at one hosted by the city’s Allan Gardens botanical gardens, he traded in pothos and peperomias to add to his already prodigious collection of 70 or so houseplants. “Can you ever have enough?” he asked. Most Valuable Species // Five Varieties Plant Swappers Hope to Get Their Green Thumbs On Monstera Obliqua The holes in its leaves earned this creeping variety of a tropical Monstera the nickname “Swiss Cheese.” The vine looks divine strangling a curtain rod, draped over a doorway, or trained to climb a wall. Enlist the aid of discreet adhesive-backed clips. Crassula ‘Buddha’s Temple’ This succulent has mesmerizing layers of leaves that look as if an origami artist folded them. A coffee-table specimen for even the most discerning collector (you’d never guess it belongs to the same genus as the common jade plant). Epiphyllum Guatemalense Monstrose ‘Curly Locks’ If “curly cactus” sounds like a deadly oxymoron, try picturing Rapunzel’s ringlets tumbling down the side of a terra cotta wall. Your untamed specimen on a bookshelf spells out “connoisseur” as clearly as your casually stacked first editions. Monstera Deliciosa Albo Variegata The ghostly white banding on this variety of the popular split-leaf plant is a mutation. The species is time-consuming to propagate, which keeps supplies low and “likes” high on Instagram. Pilea peperomioides A desktop accessory that says “I have Scandi style,” this houseplant with lily-pad leaves has long been popular in Norway and Sweden. With easy-to-root cuttings, this pilea is now spreading among friends in other developed nations faster than jars of sourdough starter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86,Getting to know the people of Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside,Stories from the neighbourhood paint a different picture than the bleak headlines and grim statistics often associated with it,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/getting-to-know-the-people-of-vancouvers-downtowneastside/article37467872/,2018-01-01T02:11:36Z,"I n a neighbourhood most often associated with drug use and poverty – and more recently an overdose crisis driven by fentanyl – it can be easy to overlook the stories of the people who make up the Downtown Eastside community. The Globe and Mail spoke with six members of the area about life in a place most Canadians only hear about through bleak headlines and grim statistics. When Ms. Chen bought the Save on Meats diner in 2000, she neither spoke English nor knew anything about running a restaurant. But Ms. Chen had been a successful business owner in Beijing and wanted to keep busy after immigrating with her young daughter to Canada. Story continues below advertisement ""The customers taught me everything,"" Ms. Chen said. ""They would say, 'That's scrambled. That's eggs over easy.' I didn't know what mayonnaise was. There were a lot of things I didn't know."" She ran the diner for 10 years, until the building was sold. In 2015, she took over the iconic Ovaltine Cafe down the street, where these days she can be seen cheerfully serving up milkshakes, hamburgers and greasy breakfasts for the neighbourhood's old-timers and young kids alike. The diner is busiest the days after social-assistance cheques are distributed, when some patrons also pop in to repay the money she is owed: ""Here's that $10 I owe you, Grace. Thank you."" Ms. Chen has observed the gradual change of the Downtown Eastside over the years, and plans to update the menu next year to accommodate an increasingly younger demographic. ""Mostly, they like hamburgers and breakfast,"" she said, ""but they also like some fancy things like toast with avocado and poached eggs."" Ms. Charlie faced unspeakable tragedy when she lost two sons in two years, one to alcohol poisoning and one to a fentanyl-related overdose. In an effort to numb the pain, she drank until her own health suffered. Her turnaround happened in an unassuming street market in the Downtown Eastside, where she found support, purpose and friendship. Story continues below advertisement ""The people at the market gave me a reason to wake up, something to look forward to,"" Ms. Charlie said. ""They were there to support me."" She stopped drinking. Over four years and at two market locations, Ms. Charlie worked several jobs including cleaner, concessions and now volunteer supervisor. The overdose death also spurred market manager and community advocate Sarah Blyth to erect a pop-up overdose prevention site in a tent at the back of the market in September, 2016 – three months before the provincial government opened more than 20 across the province. The site eventually received government support and moved into a trailer. Earlier this month, the facility moved indoors to a space next door. Earlier this year, when Ms. Charlie spoke of saving up for headstones for her two sons, Ms. Blyth helped facilitate a $3,000 donation from a member of Vancouver's skateboard community. ""I'm very grateful for what they did for me,"" Ms. Charlie said. Story continues below advertisement When Mr. Herbst decided to leave Ensenada, Baja California, and a frenetic life of drinking and drug use that was beginning to destroy him, he headed north to Vancouver – far away, but still by the ocean. Mr. Herbst had operated several businesses in the past, including a surf resort in Ensenada and a T-shirt printing business in Toronto. But in his single room that first year in Vancouver, he needed a smaller operation to get his hustle off the ground. ""I created a formula for lip balm and put it in some tubes,"" he said, recalling long days mixing essential oils over a $20 hot plate to come up with the right formula. The owner and manager of the building he was staying in soon took interest and lent him money to get a natural skincare product off the ground, Mr. Herbst said. Sixteen years later, Mr. Herbst's Serf to Surf shop on East Hastings Street offers a combination of his various passions: Natural skincare products with tropical smells that evoke his surf days; and custom apparel, much of it emblazoned with original EASTVAN logos. He has hundreds of clients around the world. He regularly gives away his skincare products to residents of the Downtown Eastside to help heal skin ailments associated with drug use and rough living. He recalls flagging down a man who walked by with bright red splotches all over his face and giving him a tin of healing balm. ""I thought a meth lab must have blown up in his face,"" Mr. Herbst said. ""Turns out he had gotten bear sprayed. A month later, he comes in and says, 'I've got to give you a hug.'"" Some of the best meals available to low-income residents are on the second floor of Vancouver's Carnegie Community Centre. There, hungry patrons can fill up on dishes such as roast beef with Yukon gold potatoes, wild salmon with organic brown rice and chicken with Mexican chili dry rub – all made from scratch, and for $2 or $3. The directive to use fresh, healthy foods has long been in place at the cafeteria. But in recent years, food services co-ordinator Steve McKinley has helped elevate the food quality further, leading a shift toward more restaurant-style dishes. ""In the last few years, we've gotten super seasonal,"" he said. ""We'll have arugula and young green beans because it's spring, for example. We've also done more contemporary things, like poke."" Diverse chefs on the team help shape ethnic menus: Indian, Middle Eastern, Japanese, Italian. To keep prices low, the cafeteria relies on donations and has partnerships with local produce growers and food-recovery programs. It also enlists hundreds of volunteers. Mr. McKinley, who used to work for a high-end catering company in Toronto, describes his work as both challenging and rewarding. ""I feel like I'm doing a super value-added job,"" he said. ""And you really do get genuine appreciation back."" Mr. Dumas had been a self-described ""hardcore"" drug user for 20 years, a dealer for around 18. He also committed petty crimes – thefts and such – to support his habit. At the top of this year, he met community advocate Sarah Blyth, who offered him a position tidying up Pigeon Park for a modest weekly honorarium. He says the drug game had grown more dangerous in recent years, both as a dealer and a user. He has lost five friends to overdoses in the past few months alone. He accepted Ms. Blyth's offer. Mr. Dumas has stopped dealing and instead spends his time cleaning up the high-traffic park, several times a day, complementing the efforts of city crews. He has become somewhat of an ambassador to the park, which could be considered a living room, of sorts, for low-income locals. ""It makes me feel good,"" Mr. Dumas said. ""I like it. I've noticed a lot of old people at the park now. You didn't see that before."" Ms. Blyth said Mr. Dumas, with help from the city, has created a welcoming space for community members. ""It's about giving people an alternative to selling dope, giving people opportunities to do something different,"" Ms. Blyth said. Ms. Uto has worked at Vancouver's Carnegie Community Centre for 15 years, first as a volunteer, then an adult educator and now an arts programmer. In her current role, Ms. Uto organizes activities such as poetry nights, music jams and art classes – all free – for the area's low-income residents. A jazz trombonist teaches every Tuesday, and the Carnegie Jazz Band performs at various events. Ms. Uto considers these programs ""gateway programs."" The inherent value of such artistic initiatives is strengthened by their ability to draw in people who might never have been interested in the arts, welcoming them into a community. ""People come into the centre, maybe they've had a bad day outside, and they see some people in here doing some beading. They join, and for the next 30 minutes, they're able to focus on that. To me, that's the main value of a centre like this,"" she said. ""We never say that we do art therapy – we're a community centre – but all of these are ways in which people can feel better about themselves and build community.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87,‘North Korea Is the Biggest Threat to All Humankind.’ U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad Talks to TIME,Branstad talks to TIME in an exclusive interview—his first since arriving in Beijing in July,http://time.com/5044371/north-korea-terry-branstad-us-ambassador-china-xi-jinping-interview/,2017-12-01T08:05:28Z,"Tucked between northeastern Beijing’s third and fourth ring-roads, the U.S. Embassy in China is a squat complex of silver-gray buildings, with the ambassador’s office on the fourth floor. Inside, besides the requisite star-spangled banners, grinning photos and auspicious Chinese calligraphy, the new occupant has placed what looks like an incongruous addition on a low shelf behind the desk: a model of a yellow-green John Deere tractor. “They have five factories here,” U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad tells TIME in an exclusive interview, his first since arriving in Beijing in July. “But I had to sell all my John Deere stock when I was appointed ambassador because they do business in China.” And yet a tractor is, in many ways, a fitting symbol of Branstad’s heritage as the former Governor of Iowa — America’s second most productive agricultural state after California — as well as the deep economic and cultural links he’s built with China since his first visit here in 1984. Some $1.4 billion of Iowa’s total $2.3 billion agricultural exports in 2015 went to China — mainly soybean and pork — and U.S. President Donald Trump has tasked Branstad with helping to boost the trade relationship on a national scale, hopefully eating into the $347 billion trade deficit that Trump claims costs American jobs. (Though most economists disagree.) But besides trade, Branstad’s new portfolio includes easing the myriad frictions between the world’s established superpower and its presumptive one. Washington and Beijing clash on human-rights, censorship, territorial claims in the South China Sea, intellectual property theft, cyber-espionage and much more. Top of the agenda is how to rein in North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. On the morning Branstad sat down with TIME on a white leather sofa, briefing folder open on his lap, Kim Jong Un fired another ballistic missile into the Sea of Japan — one experts say soared ten times higher than the International Space Station and could potentially have reached anywhere in the continental United States. “North Korea is the biggest threat to all of humankind as far as I’m concerned today,” says Branstad. “And I think the cooperation and collaboration with China has improved dramatically since I’ve been here.” It doesn’t hurt, of course, that on Apr. 29, 1985, Branstad met a young Chinese official from Hebei province leading a five-strong agricultural delegation to Iowa. “His business card said ‘Feed Association of Shijiazhuang,’” Branstad recalls. That official’s name was Xi Jinping, and today he boasts several more impressive titles, including President of China. The two men stuck up an easy rapport that continued as Xi ascended the slippery ziggurat of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). When Branstad received Trump’s nomination for ambassador, Chinese officials described the mustachioed 71-year-old as an “old friend of China,” a big compliment in Beijing-speak. “I’m in a unique situation in that I’m an old friend of Xi Jinping and a loyal supporter of the [U.S.] president,” Branstad explains. “And this is probably the most important relationship in the world — between China and the United States.” Xi and Branstad connected again in 2011, when, in his second stint as Iowa governor after an 11-year hiatus from public life, Branstad made another trade mission to Hebei province. “Normally I visit the party secretary or the governor of Hebei,” says Branstad. This time, however, “I get to meet with the Vice-President Xi Jinping in the Great Hall of the People.” Xi spent 45 minutes reminiscing about his time in Iowa in 1985 (“as governor I only gave people half-an-hour,” grins Branstad) — reeling off the names of all the people he’d met and places visited. “He went to a birthday party, he visited farms and factories, he went to the president of the corn growers, he went to a turkey farm, he went to the Monsanto plant,” says Branstad. “He said that when he thinks of America he thinks of the wonderful people he met in Iowa and he calls us ‘old friends.’” Following that visit, Branstad decided to invite Xi for a reunion in the Hawkeye State the next year. Within months plans were well underway, allowing Xi to reconnect with the Dvorchak family, with whom he stayed in Muscatine in 1985 — even posing for informal photos around a roaring fireplace. It’s a cozy scene that is difficult to reconcile with a man who at October’s 19th CCP Congress was apotheosized alongside Mao Zedong as one of modern China’s greatest leaders. “Long-term friendships and relationships are really important in this culture,” says Branstad. “But now I have to deliver the message on things that we are not happy with. And yet I think I have some credibility because of that long-term relationship.” Trump painted China as America’s nemesis during his volcanic campaign, blaming its export-driven economy for stealing American jobs, as well as predatory trade practices such as currency manipulation. As Branstad went through the ambassadorial confirmation process, Trump even questioned Chinese sovereignty over self-governing Taiwan — a bold affront to Beijing, which regards the island of 23 million as its own. Since then, though, Trump has dialed down his antagonism, welcomed Xi to his Florida resort of Mar-a-Lago in April, and then enjoyed a gilded “state visit-plus” to Beijing earlier this month. Trump was treated to unprecedented honors, such as dining in the Forbidden City — home of China’s emperors. But the subsequent joint press conference featured no questions (in contrast to Barack Obama’s team insisting on some during his last visit, in a pointed reminder to their authoritarian hosts on the merits of a free press). In fact, TIME and several other foreign media were denied access altogether. Critics said China was being given a free pass for its worsening record on human-rights and free speech. Jorge Guajardo, Mexico’s ambassador to China from 2007 to 2013, told Quartz that China played Trump “like a fiddle.” For Branstad, however, there is no letting up on subjects that are “part of American DNA.” He says: “We are bringing up human-rights issues all the time. Unfortunately, China is an authoritarian system, it’s a one-party communist-ruled country. We are a democratic country with a free-market system.” Branstad says he had “many meetings” with Chinese officials regarding imprisoned democracy advocate Liu Xiaobo, and managed to allow him to be visited by American and German doctors. Liu died in detention, unable to seek treatment for cancer abroad that medical experts said could have saved his life. Today, Liu’s wife, Liu Xia, remains under virtual house arrest. She has never been charged with a crime yet is unable to leave the country despite repeatedly expressing her desire to do so. “We’re still trying to see that his wife is free to travel,” says Branstad. “But we find that the best and most effective way to try and get action here is not to shame them publicly but to meet with them privately.” That’s also how Branstad hopes to make progress on North Korea and he has enlisted the help of Sheena Greitens, an East Asia expert at the University of Missouri. She put together a group to coach the new Ambassador about the Koreas, the South China Sea, Taiwan, and other regional issues. China has also signed up to two new U.N. Security Council Resolutions since Branstad took the job, and he believes Chinese support for its historic ally is wavering. “I think the attitude has changed here,” he says. For one thing, he adds, the timing of North Korean nuclear and missile tests at politically sensitive moments for Beijing show they “are as much against Xi Jinping and China as they are against the United States.” Whether China will turn off the half a million barrels of oil it sends to North Korea each year is another question. For Xi, squeezing the Kim regime to the brink of collapse would risk open conflict with an irascible nuclear power, as well as a torrent of refugees pouring across their shared border, and the strategic headache of a united Korean peninsular ruled from Seoul, possibly putting American troops on his doorstep. Still, “China has taken steps much further than a lot of people thought they ever would on the sanctions,” says Branstad. “Obviously the big thing is oil — that’s probably the biggest thing that could make a difference.” And if the situation doesn’t improve? “Military action is a last resort, but that is an option as well,” he says. That would, of course, mean missiles falling less than 500 miles from Beijing, where Branstad has not only been joined by his wife, but also their daughter and her husband — who both work at an international school — as well his two young grandchildren. The family is heading back to Iowa for Christmas, but held Thanksgiving in the sprawling Chinese capital, where Branstad says all are thriving despite an oppressive regimen of choking pollution, whirring air purifiers and freezing temperatures. His daughter’s family has even purchased an electric buggy to weave through the city’s traffic like savvy locals. “They are young,” says Brandstad of his grandchildren, “but this is a great time to learn Mandarin, just like the president’s granddaughter. We’re hopeful that they’ll be fluent before it’s over.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88,Florence floods handful of hog lagoons,Farm bill talks remain at a crawl — New tariffs heighten trade war with China — Ag advisers review U.S.-Mexico trade deal,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-agriculture/2018/09/18/florence-floods-handful-of-hog-lagoons-344019,2018-09-18T14:00:42Z,"With help from Helena Bottemiller Evich and Doug Palmer FLORENCE FLOODS HANDFUL OF HOG LAGOONS : North Carolina officials are monitoring swine-waste lagoons that were overrun or threatened by floodwaters after then-Hurricane Florence dumped more than 30 inches of rain on parts of the state — and as rivers there continue to overflow. Environmental and public health groups have warned that bacteria-filled waste from flooded lagoons could contaminate water supplies, though local pork groups argue the safety risks are overstated. Story Continued Below Latest lagoon watch: One waste lagoon in Duplin County had been breached as of Monday afternoon, Michael Regan, secretary of the state’s Department of Environmental Quality, said during a news conference with Gov. Roy Cooper. Regan said he’s received reports of two flooded waste lagoons in Jones County and five “overtops” — when lagoon matter spills over the side. “Reports are continuing to come in,” he said, and the department will send out staff to investigate the incidents when conditions are safe. Pork industry reaction: The North Carolina Pork Council said four lagoons had been flooded and that the one breach Regan mentioned was “on a small farm … where an on-site inspection showed that solids remained in the lagoon.” “While there are more than 3,000 active lagoons in the state that have been unaffected by the storm, we remain concerned about the potential impact of these record-shattering floods,” the group said in a statement. Environmentalists were also working to survey the damage. The group Waterkeeper Alliance said its members were using airplanes and kayaks to scan the floodwaters for any lagoons that were breached or inundated, as well as other sites like coal-powered plants that could cause environmental problems. The storm has also taken a toll on North Carolina’s poultry industry. Sanderson Farms said Monday that about 1.7 million chickens had been killed by flooding at contractor farms in the state, and another 30 farms — housing a combined 6.3 million birds — were surrounded by floodwaters and couldn’t be reached by feed trucks. Looking ahead: Hog producers in North Carolina are generally much better prepared for major storms than they were two decades ago, when Hurricane Floyd wiped out 21,500 swine and flooded 50 waste lagoons, according to NCPC stats. But pig farms still remain in the state’s floodplains, and further changes to increase storm readiness — like covered lagoons — could be part of the larger debate in the state. “We are going to have to be smart about our recovery and about our long-range planning,” Cooper said Monday, referring to the state in general. “When you have two 500-year floods within two years of each other, it’s pretty clear that it’s not a 500-year flood.” He also said “significant federal resources” will be needed in the storm’s aftermath. Watch for Congress to potentially take up a disaster relief spending package in the weeks or months ahead, like lawmakers did last year after a series of hurricanes. “This is an epic storm that is still continuing,” Cooper said. “The rivers are rising in certain parts of our state. Some areas have not seen the worst flooding yet.” HAPPY TUESDAY, SEPT. 18!

Follow the whole team @Morning_Ag. FARM BILL TALKS REMAIN AT A CRAWL: House and Senate agriculture leaders haven’t had any major breakthroughs as they head into a crucial week for meeting their goal of passing a farm bill by Sept. 30, Senate Agriculture Chairman Pat Roberts and ranking member Debbie Stabenow told reporters late Monday. The so-called big four — which includes the two Senate ag leaders and their House counterparts — still haven’t worked out if they will be able to meet in person this week. House Agriculture Chairman Mike Conaway will be in Washington even though the House isn’t in session, but it’s not clear if all four lawmakers will be able to line up their schedules. The four principals are aiming to hold a call today, Roberts told reporters. More time on the clock? While current law expires at the end of the month, both Roberts and Stabenow have now suggested that any pain from a lapse would not really be felt until December, which could mean lawmakers are moving back their goal post as they try to come to a deal on H.R. 2 (115). “We’re not sure we actually need an extension,” Stabenow said late Monday. Roberts offered the same sentiment last week. About those tweets: The Michigan Democrat was also asked whether President Donald Trump’s tweets and Conaway’s recent comments blaming her for holding up negotiations could poison the well. “It’s not helpful, certainly... but I’m going to act in a way that I believe is responsible and helpful to get a farm bill done,” she said. “I can’t be responsible for other people.” Big differences: Stabenow suggested there’s still little agreement on large swaths of the omnibus farm legislation. “We very much want to get it done,” she said. “There’s just very different views on how farm programs should look, how conservation programs should look, how food assistance programs should look, how energy programs should look — there’s just a lot of big differences, but we have not stopped working.” On SNAP: Roberts said while progress has been made on the commodity and conservation titles, “the real big issue is SNAP.” He added, “To date, at least, I’ve not been ingenious enough … to come up with something that will work, but as this draws down to this final week here, we’ve got to come to some agreement.” ** A message from the Corn Refiners Association: The Corn Refiners Association’s new website, new look, and new office spaces highlight the groundbreaking ways corn products improve our lives.

Learn more. ** NEW TARIFFS HEIGHTEN TRADE WAR WITH CHINA: Trump on Monday evening slapped tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, intensifying the trade spat that’s already stung many farmers and ranchers who face retaliatory tariffs on their agricultural products. The U.S. will impose a 10 percent duty on the goods starting Sept. 24 and raise the rate to 25 percent on Jan. 1, 2019. “Further, if China takes retaliatory action against our farmers or other industries, we will immediately pursue phase three, which is tariffs on approximately $267 billion of additional imports,” Trump said in a statement, as Pro Trade’s Doug Palmer reports. The Trump administration now has issued tariffs on more than $250 billion in Chinese goods in total. Adding another $267 billion would cover essentially all Chinese exports to the U.S. Beijing has vowed to retaliate by imposing tariffs on an additional $60 billion worth of U.S. exports, targeting more than 5,200 types of goods like honey and liquefied natural gas. That would bring the total to $113 billion. So much for that: Trump’s move comes after U.S. and Chinese officials last week were working to set up a new round of trade discussions aimed at easing the tariff tensions. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said Monday that Trump has been unhappy with previous rounds of trade talks with China, but U.S. officials are ready to resume negotiations “as long as it’s going to be a serious discussion” to address issues like intellectual property theft and the forced transfer of U.S. technology, Pro Ag’s Catherine Boudreau reports. Trump left the door open to direct talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping to resolve the trade spat. “Hopefully, this trade situation will be resolved, in the end, by myself and President Xi of China, for whom I have great respect and affection,” he said in the statement. China’s reaction: The latest overtures of talks, however, seem more tenuous. Our partners at the South China Morning Post reported Tuesday that China will probably cancel its plans to send Xi’s top economic adviser to Washington in light of the latest tariff action, citing a government source. But the source cautioned that a final decision has yet to be made. Officially, China vowed to take counter measures, without specifying what it will do next. “The U.S. insists on increasing tariffs, which brings new uncertainty to the consultations between the two sides,” China’s Commerce Ministry said on Tuesday, according to an informal translation. “It is hoped that the U.S. will recognize the possible negative consequences of such actions and take convincing means to correct them in a timely manner.” AG ADVISERS REVIEW U.S.-MEXICO TRADE DEAL: Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland will return to Washington this week to resume discussions over a new North American trade agreement, Pro Canada’s Lauren Gardner reported Monday. But as negotiators work to bring Canada into the two-way trade deal between the U.S. and Mexico, representatives of U.S. ag groups are quickly reviewing details of the bilateral agreement that could potentially replace NAFTA if talks with Canada for a three-way pact fall through. There are 28 advisory committees set up by Congress to review any trade deal text to make sure it suits the interests of their industries. Most of the groups are drawn from the private sector. Their reports are due to the U.S. Trade Representative by Sept. 27. Among those committees are seven focused on agricultural topics: fruits and vegetables; animal products; grains and seeds; tobacco, cotton and peanuts; processed foods; sweeteners; and an overarching agricultural policy panel. Advisory members aren’t cleared to chat publicly about provisions of the agreement, but several members, or the groups they represent, had previously weighed in on the U.S.-Mexico agreement and the trade talks in general. Reading the tea leaves: Public statements from groups with seats on the committees suggest many in the agricultural community are pleased there’s at least a two-way agreement with Mexico, but they would much prefer a trilateral pact. The U.S. Grain Council was one of several groups in August to suggest that a trilateral pact with Canada was critical for its members. The group’s trade policy director, Floyd Gaibler, sits on the 31-member advisory committee for grains, feed, oilseeds and planting seeds. Agricultural Policy Advisory Committee member Mike Stuart, president of the Florida Fruit &amp; Vegetable Association, has said the tentative trade deal with Mexico was “not the outcome we have worked for” because it lacked a remedy for U.S. specialty crop growers competing with cheaper Mexican fruit and vegetable imports. For other groups, a bilateral deal alone might not be so bad. The U.S. Dry Bean Council, whose executive director Rebecca Bratter sits on the grains advisory committee, applauded the August agreement in a statement, noting that Mexico is the biggest export market for U.S. dry beans. Still, the group also said it hoped for a three-way deal with Canada. ROW CROPS: — Expanded SNAP options for Florence victims: USDA will allow SNAP recipients in North Carolina to use their benefits to buy hot foods through Oct. 31. Hot foods and foods intended for immediate consumption can’t typically be purchased with food stamps, but USDA approved a waiver to help North Carolinians who evacuated ahead of Hurricane Florence and aren’t able to store or cook food. — Senate easily passes opioids package: The Senate voted 99-1 to pass a package of bills aimed at combating the opioid crisis, setting up talks with the House to work out differences in their versions of the legislation, H.R. 6 (115). Some addiction groups have said the Senate bill doesn’t provide enough sustainable funding to reverse the addiction crisis.

EPA is still discussing the matter with USDA, the White House and the Energy Department, as Pro Energy’s Eric Wolff reports. — USDA to spend $392 million on water projects: Anne Hazlett, USDA’s assistant to the secretary for rural development, said the funding will go toward rebuilding rural water and wastewater infrastructure in 42 states, including for projects such as replacing water lines and mains, digging wells and building treatment plants. Here’s the full list of projects. — Americans are eating out less: The average U.S. consumer is estimated to dine at a restaurant 186 times in 2018, according to data from market research company NPD Group. That’s a 28-year low, down from an average of 215 restaurant visits in 2000. New York Magazine’s Grub Street blog has more here. — Corn group names full-time CEO: Jon Doggett is now CEO of the National Corn Growers Association, the group announced on Friday. He had been interim CEO since Aug. 1. Before joining NCGA in 2002, he was the American Farm Bureau Federation’s lead lobbyist on ethanol, land use, conservation and other policy areas. — More industry moves: Tyson Foods said Monday that CEO Tom Hayes will leave the company at the end of this month, and that COO Noel White will become the new chief executive. Reuters has more on the changes at Tyson. Also Monday, Clarissa Moreaux was named director of regulatory affairs at the North American Meat Institute. Moreaux is leaving Dine Brands Global, which owns Applebee’s and IHOP. She also previously worked at USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service. — Coca-Cola sees green in cannabis drinks: The classic beverage maker is considering a partnership with Canadian marijuana company Aurora Cannabis to manufacture drinks infused with CBD, which reduces pain but doesn’t get consumers high.

89,Jamaica wants in on the booming marijuana market. But will farmers be able to cash in?,"According to the State Department, Jamaica is the largest Caribbean supplier of illegal pot to the United States.",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/11/28/jamaica-wants-booming-marijuana-market-but-farmers-able-cash-in/903585001/,2017-11-28T23:36:59Z,"In this Aug. 29, 2013 photo, farmer Breezy shows off the distinctive leaves of a marijuana plant during a tour of his plantation in Jamaica's central mountain town of Nine Mile. (Photo: David McFadden, AP) Most of the time farmers are proud of their crops and are happy to talk about them. But ask a certain kind of farmer what they grow and they might seem a little evasive. “I farm goats and cows and cabbage in the bush,” says Baxter, a middle-aged farmer in Jamaica. Inquire further and he starts to laugh. Baxter isn’t his real name. He doesn’t want to use it because one of his biggest crops is marijuana. Baxter wears black plastic sunglasses and khaki cargo shorts torn off below the knee. His teeth are stained from the cigarettes he seems to be rolling constantly. He’s standing in the center of a small, rural town on the edge of a bustling street. Goats, chickens and dogs wander through, trying to avoid brightly colored motorbikes. Here in Jamaica, where Baxter lives and works, growing pot for recreational use is illegal. But it’s still a business. “Yeah, man, a big business,” he says. “A big, illegal business.” So Baxter’s farm is hidden. It has to be. To find it, you have to head deep into the countryside. First, a taxi ride out of town. Then, a hike through green sugar cane on a dirt path. Finally, around a corner, is a rocky field covered with knee-high marijuana plants. At night, Baxter sleeps in the open, under a lean-to. Someone always has to be on the lookout for government helicopters. But that could change. The international market for marijuana is booming. It’s set to reach $50 billion within a decade. And after spending millions to crack down on the drug, Jamaica’s government has decided it wants to cash in. It legalized medical marijuana and created a new licensing system to allow farmers to legally grow cannabis for medical, scientific or therapeutic purposes. But the fees are expensive and small farmers like Baxter say they’re being left by the wayside. “It’s not easy, lots of money to get the license,” he says. “Lots of thousands of dollars.” Applying for the license alone costs $300 and the licenses can cost farmers thousands of dollars per acre. Then there are processing fees, transportation fees and more. Jamaica’s Cannabis Licensing Authority says some of these other expensive requirements, like fencing and surveillance cameras, are dictated by international drug laws. Kim Ford is also a local farmer. Her parents sent her to school in the U.S., but now she’s back and is a member of her local Hemp and Ganja Growers Association. She says all these costs have her worried about wealthy foreigners. “They make more money and then they come here and can pay for licensing, build a whole building, buy a piece of land to put it on, and can move forward,” she says. China has already invested hundreds of millions of dollars in bauxite mining and sugarcane in Jamaica. Other foreigner investors from Canada and the United Kingdom have purchased some of the hotels lining Jamaica’s famous white-sand beaches. Ford says she worries the same thing could happen with cannabis — wealthy business people with foreign passports coming in and taking over once again. “It’s a constant taking away from a country,” she says. Another part of the problem? The United States. “Jamaica never would have made (medical) cannabis illegal but for the influence of the United States.” According to the State Department, Jamaica is the largest Caribbean supplier of illegal pot to the United States. Charles Nesson, a Harvard Law professor with a lifelong interest in Jamaica says the federal government doesn’t want more weed coming in. But, Nesson says, keeping pot illegal in Jamaica means problems for small farmers like Baxter. “Criminalize something that is widely available to poor people, widely used by poor people — that leaves discretion in the police as to who they want to arrest,” he says. There are billions of dollars at stake and a whole list of problems. But there’s also cultural pushback here in Jamaica. The stereotype that all Jamaicans smoke weed is just that — a stereotype. Jamaican culture is traditional — even conservative. And pot is not always OK. Traditionally, it’s Jamaica’s Rastafarians who’ve embraced cannabis — for spiritual reasons. And the push to legalize ganja has made things better for them. Police are no longer allowed to arrest anyone carrying less than two ounces. Last year the Rastafari community held a three-day cultural celebration during which participants were legally able to use the drug. They plan to have another celebration in December. Ras Iyah V is a Rastafari elder. He wants Jamaicans to benefit from the new regulations, but not just spiritually. “I want to see economic benefit coming from the ganja industry coming back to the community,” he says. But educating sustenance farmers about government regulations is difficult. Iyah V is also on the board of the Cannabis Licensing Authority. He says they’ve been holding community meetings, but often, farmers don’t show up. “If people are paying attention to what is going on, then some of these fears would be alleviated.” Like fears about all those fees. The licensing board says it’s aware of the concerns. It’ll waive fees for small farmers until the end of the year after their crops are sold. It’s also working on a pilot project to let farmers share costs. But that doesn’t mean all that much to farmers like Baxter. He says years ago, his farm was discovered — spotted by government workers from the sky. ""A big, green helicopter... come straight over the field, with a white guy in it.” His entire crop was destroyed. “They cut all of it and burn it,” he says. Baxter waited till the weather was cool enough and then he planted his fields again. He’s not planning to apply for a license but he is planning to keep farming.

Some of these monikers do not get high marks for originality, as they literally mean “national team” or are mere descriptions of a team’s colors. Others are far more interesting, with whimsically hued animals or nicknames that ascribe traits not normally associated with a certain countries. (Who knew that Belgians were particularly devilish?) In any case, here’s the rundown for this year’s World Cup, broken up into their corresponding categories. Want smart World Cup analysis, opinions, viewing guides and more? Sign up for our month-long newsletter. THE LITERALISTS Russia: Sbornaya literally means “national team.” Come on, Russia. Your machine may never break, but your nickname game is broken. Portugal: Selecao means “the selection.” Could you dumb it down a shade, Portugal? Iran: “Team Melli” translates to “the national team.” Germany: Die Mannschaft has an almost industrial heft to it but simply means “The Team.” You win the World Cup as many times as Germany has, you can choose whatever nickname you want. [ U.S., Mexico and Canada win joint bid for 2026 World Cup, topping Morocco in FIFA vote ] SHOWING THE COLORS Uruguay: La Celeste, the most common nickname for Uruguay, is pretty straightforward, as it means “the sky blue” and the team wears … sky-blue uniforms. But give me La Garra Charrúa (“the Charrúa Claw”) anytime. The secondary nickname is taken from the indigenous people of Uruguay and makes it sound as if Uruguay’s soccer team is composed of a bunch of old-timey pro wrestlers. Spain: The 2010 champions could have just gone with the red of the Spanish flag and called it a day, but instead we have La Furia Roja — the Red Fury. It’s a nice touch. France: Les Bleus sums up the color of France’s uniforms. Yawn. Peru: La Blanquirroja is a fun-sounding word with a decidedly less-exciting meaning: “the white and red.” Denmark: De Rød-Hvide is Danish for La Blanquirroja, more or less. Argentina: La Albiceleste means white and sky blue. Mexico: El Tri, after the three colors of Mexico’s flag (green, white and red). Sweden: Another literal explanation of a team’s colors, with Blågult meaning “blue and yellow.” Poland: Biało-czerwoni translates to the “white and reds,” which — and this will shock you — is the color of Poland’s national team. The team also is known as Orły, or the Eagles. POSSIBLY MENACING ANIMALS Saudi Arabia: The Green Falcons! Caw! Morocco: When not touring as a mid-level college-rock band, the Atlas Lions are taking the pitch with a pretty solid nickname taken from the mountain range that dominates Morocco. Nigeria: If you don’t dig the Super Eagles, I’m not sure you can be helped. Brazil: Canarinho (“Little Canary”) is kind of the anti-Super Eagles, because who is going to be intimidated by a canary, but apparently there are many such yellow birds in Brazil. Serbia: Orlovi are the Eagles to the English-speaking among us, a tip of the bill to the mighty birds that adorn the country’s coat of arms. England: The Three Lions nickname is taken from an emblem that dates to King Richard I, who ruled from 1189 to 1199. Coincidentally, this also was the last time England was relevant on the world soccer stage. Senegal: Les Lions de la Téranga, or the Lions of Teranga. In Senegal, Teranga is a concept of intense fellowship and hospitality that has become a way of life for the Western African nation. [ Spain fires its coach two days before World Cup opener ] A NOD TO HISTORY Egypt: The pharaohs were ancient Egyptian rulers. The Pharaohs hope to advance past the World Cup group stage for the first time in their history. Tunisia: The Eagles of Carthage take their name from the ancient Tunisian city. I know more today about the Third Punic War than I did yesterday. Thanks, Eagles of Carthage. Japan: Samurai Blue pays tribute to Japan’s warrior class of past centuries and to the color of its jerseys. MISC. GOOD NICKNAMES Iceland: Strákarnir okkar, which translates to “Our Boys.” Don’t let the rah-rah nickname fool you: Iceland is ready to pillage. Croatia: Vatreni means “The Blazers,” according to Wikipedia, but I’m also seeing it translated to “The Fiery Ones” or “The Fiery Boys,” which is a little more intimidating. Switzerland: Schweizer Nati or La Nati pretty much both mean “Switzerland national team” and almost got the Swiss thrown in the Literalist pile, but I’ll be rolling with Rossocrociati, or “Red Crusaders,” because a good national-team nickname should always suggest some sort of event involving swordplay. Costa Rica: The Costa Rican people are known as Los Ticos, so it’s a pretty apt moniker for the country’s national team. Wikipedia suggests that the team also goes by “La Muerte,” which means “death” and is so metal, but Costa Rica is perhaps the least menacing place on Earth and I can’t wrap my head around this. South Korea: The Taegeuk Warriors take their nickname from the circular symbol on the South Korean flag that denotes “supreme ultimate” and represents the duality of nature. Belgium: Any way you translate it in a nation with three official languages — De Rode Duivels in Dutch, Les Diables Rouges in French or Die Roten Teufel in German — the Belgians are the Red Devils. Panama: La Marea Roja means “the Red Tide,” which you probably should avoid both at the beach and on the pitch. Panama also goes by Los Canaleros, because it has a canal. Colombia: They grow a lot of coffee beans in Colombia. Thus we have Los Cafeteros, or the coffee growers. THE WORST. JUST THE WORST. Australia: Socceroos.

91,Cannabis expert calls for independent research body as Canada prepares for legalization,"Well-funded studies could help tackle the most pressing issues around marijuana, the academic says",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/cannabis-expert-calls-for-independent-research-body-as-canada-prepares-for-legalization/article37452309/,2017-12-29T01:47:49Z,"Canada's foremost cannabis academic says a new independent body is needed to organize and prioritize the diverse array of research on the drug as the country gets set to become the world's largest case study on the dangers – and potential benefits – of legalization. About six months out from making cannabis legal, Ottawa is turning to creative solutions and gearing up funding for independent research to help fill in the considerable knowledge gaps surrounding the way the substance affects individual users and society as a whole. Across the country, cannabis research is being funded by the federal government through grants awarded by three councils. In addition, charities such as The Arthritis Society and companies such as the licensed medical growers and Shopper's Drug Mart are also funding research. Story continues below advertisement Last month, McMaster announced the creation of a new multidisciplinary centre for cannabis research in partnership with a local health authority to focus on medical studies. And in the past year, the government-funded Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) council has invited top-level academics to informal roundtables on cannabis. But a national body is needed to organize and prioritize this diverse array of work so that key objectives are realized and resources are streamlined, says Mark Ware, a McGill pain researcher and vice-chair of last year's federal panel on cannabis legalization. Premiers discuss issues surrounding marijuana legalization (The Canadian Press) ""It would be a shame if it turns out there are five labs across the country all working on the same thing,"" said Dr. Ware, who has been part of a consortium of cannabis researchers that have met periodically over the past few years. ""We have limited personnel, limited expertise, limited funding. ""What's missing is a kind of connector."" A well-funded, independent organization for cannabis research could begin tackling the most pressing issues, he says, such as determining some kind of standard unit of measurement for the drug. ""There is not really a dose: One gram of 10-per-cent THC is different if you vape it or smoke it or use it in an oil – there's still another level that we need to get to,"" he said. ""This is not just a Canadian issue, this is a global question."" A new body could craft a consensus that would create a new global standard, he said. Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement A representative for Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor said there are no plans to create such an organization and that a wide breadth of cannabis studies are being properly directed through the country's three research councils. In response to a call for more independent cannabis research, the CIHR is set to award 10 grants next month of up to $100,000 for year-long independent projects, with the money becoming available March 1, 2018. CIHR has approved $6.8-million in funding for 15 different cannabis projects since the start of last year. Critics say the new round of studies are likely already too late to collect meaningful data before the summer. Rebecca Jesseman, senior policy adviser at the government-funded Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse, said her organization has held panels to try to connect researchers from a wide variety of cannabis projects, but there are many players in the field. The arms-length organization, which was criticized last year in a Health Canada review for its reluctance to embrace the harm-reduction approach to illicit substances, is now in the planning stages of formalizing its role as an organizing force for cannabis research, she said. ""There is just so much happening across the board, so the momentum – in terms of everybody trying to move forward – is certainly there,"" she said. ""We have some ideas in the hopper about how we can go forward in a more formal way but they're still in the planning stage and we're working on the final details."" Story continues below advertisement ---------------------------------------------------- CANNABIS RESEARCH There are dozens of continuing cannabis studies researching everything from how parents should talk to their teens about the drug to how our body's internal cannabinoid system functions. Here is a small sample of some of these projects. Marijuana legalization: Impact on prevalence and risk behaviours among youth and young adults in Canada Where University of Waterloo Study lead David Hammond $100,000 from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research The study will examine the extent to which legalization is associated with changes in five primary outcomes, including patterns of use, risk behaviours and the commercial environment. Mechanisms underlying schizophrenia Where Ottawa Hospital Research Institute Study lead Hsiao-Huei Chen $646,425 from CIHR Researchers will study mice to see whether they can inhibit an enzyme in the brain that can lead to malfunction in the regulation of dopamine and cause psychosis. That enzyme also impairs the production of one of the body's own cannabis-like compounds, leading to further problematic brain activity. Cannabis and Brain Maturation: A population-based study Where Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care in Toronto Study lead Tomas Paus $1.27-million from CIHR Researchers will study schizophrenia-related genes and cannabis use during adolescence in a group of 1,000 young men and women recruited and assessed as teenagers about 10 years ago. The study involves repeated assessments of their brains, mental health and substance use, and their genes. Anti-microbial activity of peptides against plant pathogens and food-borne pathogens Where McGill University Study lead Suha Jabaji $25,000 from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Researchers will collaborate with Victoria-based Green Sky Labs to study the potential of anti-microbial peptides as alternatives to pesticides for the control of fungal and bacterial pathogens of medical cannabis.

92,Another potential date for Senate farm bill,New tariffs could have ag blowback — Developed world spending less on ag research — EPA sued over pesticide safety rule delay,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-agriculture/2018/05/31/new-potential-date-on-senate-farm-bill-237792,2018-05-31T14:00:34Z,"With Liz Crampton, Maya Parthasarathy and Megan Cassella CIRCLE THIS DATE, MAYBE, FOR SENATE FARM BILL: After many other dates have come and gone, the Senate version may be out soon. The farm bill could be introduced as early as June 6, Senate Agriculture Chairman Pat Roberts said in his home state of Kansas on Wednesday, although it may be an overly ambitious schedule. Story Continued Below Roberts said he’d like to send the bill to the floor just one week after getting it through the committee, potentially June 12, but cautioned that date may be “a moving target,” reports Pro Ag’s Liz Crampton. Speaking at a farm in Manhattan, Kan., with fellow GOP Sen. Jerry Moran and USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue, Roberts said he has a “clear path” to bringing the bill to the bill because Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer promised he won’t file cloture on the bill — a procedural hurdle that could delay consideration. ""Now, that's amazing,"" Roberts joked. ""This is a time where if a jackrabbit hopped on the Senate floor, Chuck Schumer would either shoot it or file cloture on it."" A spokesman for Schumer said the lawmaker has said he wouldn’t force a cloture vote if Roberts and ranking member Debbie Stabenow reached an agreement on the farm bill. Staying far away from House measure: Roberts reiterated that the House version of the farm bill could not pass in the Senate because he needs 60 votes to avoid a filibuster. The House version, which has yet to pass, is still relying on solely Republican support whenever a second vote comes up. Roberts reiterated that the Senate version won’t be proposing any major changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also know as food stamps. The committee might look into “some efficiencies we can make as to how that program will be administered” but won’t attempt a major overhaul, he said. A brewing regional conflict: In other titles, Roberts said the legislation will “fix the ARC program to some degree,” referring to the Agriculture Risk Coverage program that triggers payments to commodity farmers when the average crop revenue in their county drops below a guaranteed level. But he shot down any proposal that would benefit one region of farmers over the other. “That doesn’t cut it with me. Look guys, we either hang together or hang separately,” he said, adding that “there isn’t any commodity here that is going to be hurt by the Senate bill.” The comments may be aimed at a bill, S. 2749 (115), introduced by Sens. John Thune (R-S.D.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). It would benefit the more than 90 percent of farmers growing corn and soybeans who signed up for ARC, primarily in the Midwest, in part by changing the formula for calculating subsidies. For those Southern growers of cotton, peanuts, rice and canola who signed up for the Price Loss Coverage program — which sends out payments when prices drop below reference prices set by Congress — they would likely receive lower subsidies under the Senate bill. That’s because reference prices couldn’t exceed a historical 10-year average. Midwestern might: While Roberts appears to be taking a hard stance against certain aspects of the Thune-Brown bill, the majority of Senate Agriculture Committee members represent Midwestern states, including top Democrat Stabenow, who’s from Michigan.

In the latest “Women Rule” podcast, POLITICO Playbook co-author Anna Palmer is joined by Milk Bar owner Christina Tosi, who is putting politics aside as she expands further into the nation’s capital — in an environment where politics is increasingly spilling into Washington’s dining scene. A new Milk Bar opens in Washington, D.C., this week — a place that Tosi emphasizes as a “place of inclusion,” no matter your political views. “Starting Milk Bar — it’s food for the people. It’s baked goods for the people,” Tosi says. “I was raised by a family that was like, ‘You don’t talk about money at the table, and you don’t talk about politics at the table.’” While the dessert queen keeps an apolitical public position, she makes clear that she does support the power of women —in both politics and other walks of life.

TARIFFS MAY BE COMING — AS WELL AS THE BLOWBACK ON AG: President Donald Trump could very well announce steel and aluminum tariffs on the United States’ closest allies today — and that could result in some serious pain for ag producers. Conversations are continuing, and any official document released by the White House is expected to include some wiggle room, report POLITICO’s Megan Cassella and Ben White. But the European Union is all but resigned to accepting that some sort of action may come its way The targeted lists: The EU has vowed to hit back with retaliatory tariffs. In March, it drafted a list of $3.3 billion worth of U.S. imports it would strike. A list obtained by POLITICO shows that the targeted products for retaliation were drafted so as not to harm EU industries. Some products on the list clearly gun for politically sensitive Republican states, like Kentucky bourbon. Others take aim at various food sectors like rice, peanut butter, orange juice and cranberries. Other harm: It is unclear if Canada and Mexico will get a reprieve, but as of Wednesday night, they were being considered for the tariffs. They, too, are likely to retaliate. ""Canada considers it frankly absurd that we would in any way be considered to be a national security threat to the United States,"" Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters Wednesday. ""I would like to absolutely assure Canadian participants, those who work in steel and aluminum industries, that the government is absolutely prepared to and will defend Canadian industries and Canadian jobs."" AG RESEARCH SPENDING FALLS IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD: Public spending on agricultural research and development by 31 high-income countries including the U.S. peaked in 2009, then fell by an average of 1.5 percent annually over the following four years, according to a new analysis conducted by the USDA Economic Research Service. Investments reached more than $18 billion, then fell to $17.5 billion in 2013 -- on an inflation-adjusted basis. Although the U.S. continues to spend the most of any high-income country on agricultural R.&amp;D., its share of the total fell from 35 percent in 1960 to less than 25 percent by 2013. As MA readers may recall, scientists warn that could hurt U.S. competitiveness, especially with the rise in China’s spending. The ERS noted that these figures likely understate the decline in investment public agricultural R.&amp;D. because the cost of research tends to increase faster than the rate of inflation. Further, the U.S. share of total spending may also be lower than indicated because its has higher research costs. Total R.&amp;D. spending outpaces investment in ag: As countries become richer, the share of their public R.&amp;D. budget devoted to agriculture declines, ERS found, in part because the farm sector’s contribution to the economy also drops off. Private sector growth: In the U.S. in 2014, commodity checkoffs raised about $1 billion through mandatory assessments on farm goods. But the majority of that money was used for market promotion — such as developing new uses or enhancing health and safety attributes of food products -- rather than research. Other private investment in R.&amp;D. of farm needs — such as by seed companies — has grown from $2.1 billion in 1970 to $6.1 billion in 2013. ** A message from the International Dairy Foods Association: The dairy food industry supports nearly 3 million jobs, provides more than $64 billion in tax revenues and has an overall economic impact of more than $628 billion.

93,"Canada has developed a new cherry, and it’s a stunning success","Eighty per cent of the world's cherry varieties were bred in Canada. Its latest success, the Staccato, helped grow the industry by five times in just 13 years",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/how-canadian-scientists-are-creating-new-fruit-varieties-for-asian-markets/article38030815/,2018-02-23T10:00:38Z,"Dangling a single blood-red Staccato cherry by its green stem, anticipating the toothsome crunch and sweet, mouth-flooding juice, is nearly as pleasurable as consuming it. It's glossy, with light-red pinstriped speckles, and so plump it seems to be swelling beyond its own tight skin. It's heart-shaped but slightly flattened, as if squished horizontally between two fingers, with crisp, fragrant flesh. This particular cherry variety is hardy, resists cracking and stores well, and is capable of lasting for weeks in chilly overseas shipping containers. Its trees are self-pollinating and, according to a profile published in the Canadian Journal of Plant Science, ""precocious."" Most importantly, Staccato is a late-season variety that ripens in early August, often eight weeks after cherries from Washington State, North America's largest sweet cherry producer, are yanked from grocery shelves and markets around the world. That's important, because Washington currently leads the global market for exported cherries. It would be lunacy to take their producers on directly. But popular Washington cherries like Bing and Rainier ripen nearly a full month earlier, so by the time the Staccato cherries hit the supermarkets, they have virtually no competition. This gives Canadian cherry producers a huge edge in the global cherry market—one that has helped the industry grow nearly five-fold in just 13 years. This market advantage didn't happen by accident. The Staccato was carefully bred to fruit later in the season by government-funded researchers in Summerland, British Columbia. Back in the early 1990s, B.C. cherries were a tiny farmstead crop bringing in an annual $500,000, but thanks to aggressive investment, scientific innovation and access to overseas markets, it has become an industry that exports more than $75 million worth of fruit a year. That's still a sliver of Canada's total agricultural exports, which add up to about $56 billion annually. But Staccato demonstrates how vitally important science and technology are to Canadian agriculture. If science can help the cherry market grow so quickly, imagine what it could do for other crops. Story continues below advertisement Agriculture has always been the backbone of the Canadian economy. The sector comprises 6.7% of our GDP and employs 2.1 million Canadians—about one in every eight workers, more than the energy and renewable resources sector. Globally, Canada is ranked fifth for agriculture exports, behind the Netherlands, the United States, Brazil and China, and 11th for exports of processed agri-food products. But competition is heating up, and relying on small-scale mom-and-pop farms doesn't cut it anymore: Agriculture has gone high-tech, and if Canada doesn't invest in research and development, we're going to fall behind. Cherry varieties are developed through hybridization—crossbreeding genetically different parents to produce new qualities. Here, Amrit Singh, a breeder at the Summerland Research and Development Centre, is grafting one hybrid onto another, which helps speed up a process that can take decades Fuelled by aggressive investment in agricultural research and intensive farming, the Netherlands—a tiny country with half the population of Canada—exported €85 billion ($125 billion) in agricultural products in 2016. That's twice as much as Canada. Meanwhile, large developing economies like Brazil's are innovating faster and scaling up more efficiently. In 2015, that country's agri-food and seafood trade surplus was $82.7 billion. That same year, ours, not counting seafood, was $12.1 billion. These countries are beating us at what should be our game. This is the story of a single cherry variety, but it's also a parable of what happens when scientific innovation fuels profitable commerce and public good. Food is part of our future, and the Canadian industry's ability to produce it, improve it, distribute it and sell more of it is tightly woven into this country's fortunes. Staccato's conception was a combination of science and strategy, paired with savvy business decisions and the opening of new markets: a path lighting the way for what must happen if Canada is to remain an agricultural superpower. Staccato's story begins back in 1982 at the Summerland Research and Development Centre, nestled on the edge of glittering Okanagan Lake in British Columbia's interior. The 130,000-square-foot station, perched near the top of a towering plateau, has twice the interior space of the White House. With a 4,500-square-foot glass greenhouse and a long, elevated walkway of creamy-coloured concrete, the building is nearly invisible from the highway below—it has a kind of James Bond villain hideout vibe. This is one of 20 federal agricultural research stations scattered across the country, most of which specialize in different crops or livestock. About 28 researchers work here, supported by a blend of government money, private-sector-funded special projects and other research grants. ""For this valley, for this province, it's a big deal,"" says retired Summerland cherry breeder Frank Kappel. Even now, he says, many locals don't understand how renowned the station's cherry research actually is. The kind of breeding done at Summerland forms the foundation of all commercial livestock and plant crops, from breast-heavy chickens to cabbages guaranteed to last through the winter. Before national governments took on the responsibility for crop and animal breeding, as Canada's did in 1886, private farmers typically mated different breeds of plants and animals with one another to produce offspring that could outwit a wide range of agricultural hazards, including pests, climate and disease, while producing bigger, tastier, hardier progeny. Such a breeding program, in fact, produced one of Canada's greatest commercial successes: the multibillion-dollar canola industry. Rapeseed (as it was once known) is a member of the mustard family that produces an oil-rich seed originally used as a lamp oil and industrial lubricant. It was used in cooking as well, but wasn't ideal for that purpose, as it contained high levels of erucic acid, a chemical found to cause lesions on the hearts and organs of lab rats. In 1968, two Prairie-based research scientists released a low-acid variety of the plant, and the grain—rebranded canola (a contraction of ""can"" for Canada and ""ola,"" meaning oil)—went on to become our top agricultural export. The Canola Council of Canada estimates the crop is now worth $26.7 billion to the national economy. When it comes to breeding cherries, much of the emphasis is on getting rid of qualities that make them hard to grow, store and transport. Cherries are notoriously fickle. They crack when they get too wet and shrivel on their stems when they're too dry. They are easily bruised, prone to diseases and pests, and make a tempting meal for hungry birds and bears. But as mercurial as they are, cherries have long been considered a luxury crop for which customers are willing to pay premium prices. Breeders, including those at Summerland, have been trying to improve them for a long time. Story continues below advertisement Around 80% of the world's cherry varieties are said to have originated in Summerland, where scientists have bred cherries continuously since 1936. As with the Staccato, almost all new varieties are given names starting with ""s"" for Summerland. In 1968, using the station's robust bank of genetic material, cherry breeder Charles Lapins—the man for whom the Lapins cherry is named—scored the station's first massive win. A Latvian refugee of the Second World War, Lapins started at the station as a labourer and worked his way up to cherry breeder, eventually releasing Stella, the world's first self-fertilizing cherry. Stella increased production and saved farmers from the expensive and tedious labour of planting pollenizer trees. It was crossed into future generations, including one successful late-season variety named Sweetheart. Many of Summerland's top-performing cherry varieties were bred by cherry breeder David Lane. Back in the 1980s, he employed the technique of hybridization, crossbreeding genetically different parents to accentuate useful qualities. His methods weren't high-tech: To fertilize a blossom, he carefully removed its petals and spiky male stamens. Then he dabbed the eraser end of a yellow pencil into a vial of pollen to lift a few grains, and touched them to the yellow-tipped surface of the flower's stigma. As the microscopic particles made contact, the flower's pollen tube sucked them downward toward its ovary. Recording the cross in a notebook, Lane and his team repeated this thousands of times, racing against the calendar as delicate blossoms wilted and fell. To complicate matters, there was always the threat of natural pollination: As carefully as Lane tried to control which varieties were crossbred, he couldn't stop bees and insects from doing what comes naturally, so there were always some wild cards on every tree. Back in 1982, Staccato was one of them. That spring and summer, from a single blossom growing on a Sweetheart parent, Staccato slowly took shape. By August, the tree had produced a firm, dark-red fruit that caught Lane's attention. He plucked it from the tree, stripped its flesh and put the pit in damp, cold sand to germinate. It was then planted for sprouting alongside thousands of other seeds in the greenhouse over the winter. ""Breeding is a numbers game,"" says Kappel, who took over from Lane in 1994. ""You want to get a high number of seedlings and hope one of them pans out."" The little Staccato seed soon sprouted, growing into a two-foot-tall sapling healthy enough to be planted outside two years later. For six years, Staccato grew leaves, got taller, survived hard frost and grew again. All the while, Lane observed the fields. Summerland's experimental orchard was (and still is) a graveyard of skinny stumps, a rolling field of trunks that hadn't made the cut. If trees were diseased, covered in mildew or simply not thriving, farm technicians flagged them with blue tape, what Kappel calls ""the ribbon of death."" Once flagged, each genetically unique tree was scrubbed out of existence by a single swipe of a chainsaw. In late April 1990, the pink, blushing blossoms of the Staccato tree unfurled themselves to the world. Still flanked by hundreds of other trees in a sprawling acreage above the research centre, the tree was identified only by its number: 13S2009. It would be another decade before Staccato would be released commercially to growers, but Lane had already noticed an intriguing quality: Its cherries ripened weeks after even some of the station's latest-fruiting trees. While Ontario has a small sweet cherry industry, the vast bulk of Canada's crop, around 98%, is grown in and around the Okanagan Valley. Still, B.C.'s 4,500 planted acres come nowhere near the 75,000 acres grown in neighbouring Washington State. Once farmers there entered the cherry industry in force—a boom partially fuelled by the American-bred Bing cherry—Canada's industry was forced to its knees. It's still impossible for Canadian growers to compete on volume, and every summer Canada is flooded with cheap peak-season cherries from Washington State; this country is its biggest customer. Story continues below advertisement Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, a few local farmers worked closely with Summerland researchers to aggressively plant new shoulder-season cherry varieties, including Staccato's parent, Sweetheart. One of those farmers was Hugh Dendy, a regional pioneer who now grows cherries in New Zealand. He discovered a niche selling Summerland cherries into increasingly profitable overseas markets, during periods when there was no high-quality competition. As news of Dendy's profits spread throughout the early 1990s, neighbouring farmers started planting their own large plots of Summerland-bred cherries. By 1994, after Kappel took over from Lane, rumours about Staccato and its exceptionally late fruiting had started to circulate. By 2000, a handful of farmers had planted test plots and were pleased by the results. Even then, a few had an inkling that this cherry, by far the latest-ripening variety they'd even seen, was one they could ride all the way to the bank. Introducing a new fruit or vegetable to a hungry market of grocery middlemen and consumers is a risky business—it's important that farmers like growing it, but it's more important that it sells. For every successful new product, there will always be many more flops, says Kappel. So, over the past few decades, Summerland researchers have increasingly involved themselves in the messy science of predicting consumer taste. New varieties are now routinely subjected to blind tests in which they are rated on deliciousness, appearance and texture. At a test held on a sunny late-September day last year at Summerland's annual open house, sensory researcher Margaret Cliff pitted two established cherry varieties—the German-developed Regina and Staccato's parent, Sweetheart—against two experimental Summerland-bred cherries, including SPC276, a Staccato offspring that's showing potential. The scientists at Summerland regularly invite more than 100 volunteers (children and adults) to the research centre to conduct blind taste tests on new varieties That morning found a raft of volunteers, 28 children and 119 adults, sitting in front of voting-booth-style screens, where they received four small plastic cups on a plate, each labelled with a number and each holding a single cherry. Using a paper questionnaire, they rated the taste and texture of each sample on a nine-point hedonic scale ranging from ""like extremely"" to ""dislike extremely."" At other tables, they rated the fruits by appearance. A long-limbed woman with short blonde hair, Cliff worked the room, shuttling cherries to and fro, and recruiting participants. ""When consumers get into this,"" she says, ""they love doing it. We get pages and pages of comments."" Knowing what consumers actually want—not what they think they want or want to want—is an early step toward selling a profitable product. The sensory industry is one of the newest, fastest-growing segments in food science, as companies rush into the void of understanding what drives taste. ""You can't stick a cherry in a machine and get how good a quality or taste it has,"" Cliff says. That makes human feedback vitally important. ""We can then say to industry, 'Of the short list you have, these are likely the ones that are going to fly in the marketplace.' "" When Cliff ran similar experiments on Staccato, back before it was even given a name, it showed great promise. It had a firm texture, high sugars and balanced acidity—all good news for retailers looking for repeat customers. ""Ninety percent of new food products fail in the marketplace,"" says Cliff, who says it's part of her job to make sure any cherry released by the program is a slam dunk. ""It's just part of what goes down the drain in this world, where consumer preference and consumer choice are constantly evolving."" It's not enough, though, for a cherry to simply taste delicious. Farmers also have to be able to get them to customers in good condition. Part of what makes Staccato so appealing is its ability to last for weeks at controlled temperatures, rolling across the ocean to arrive in China for the annual gift-giving Moon Festival: Presented like fancy chocolates, a box of cherries makes a cherished gift. So Summerland's researchers are currently investigating the best way to ship the fruit thousands of miles in massive shipping containers, even embedding tiny metal sensors into individual cherries and following them through processing, storage and shipment. Many customers around the world, particularly in Asia, are willing to pay $5 to $7 or more per pound for cherries, compared with the paltry $1 to $3 fetched here in Canada. While much of that profit is eaten up by freight, duties and markup, farmers still make more money. A produce quality meter (left) is used by Peter Toivonen to analyze dry matter in the cherries, such as sugars, cell-wall material—everything that isn’t water. Margaret Cliff is a sensory and consumer research scientist Ten years ago, Peter Toivonen, a Summerland researcher specializing in long-distance fruit storage and transportation, was on a work trip in Thailand when he stumbled across a vendor selling B.C. cherries in a Bangkok market. Stacked into small, precarious pyramids, the fruit wasn't sold by the bag or the pint, but individually, one cherry at a time. Could Staccato help Canada tap that lucrative market? To find out, new varieties are put through stress tests in the concrete basement of the Summerland research centre, which contains some of the most advanced agricultural testing equipment in the world. In a recent storage experiment, several cherry varieties were held in a chamber set to 20 C to see how long they would last before they began to rot. Staccato outlasted or matched every other variety. Next up is a tougher test: Toivonen recently set a temperature-controlled storage room to a punishing 30 C and 90% relative humidity (he taped two photos of palm trees to the wall to complete the tropical setting). As cherry growers try to increase exports into Asia, where outdoor markets are a common way of retailing fruit, it's Toivonen's job to know how new varieties handle the heat. He plans to test cherries in the room soon and suspects Staccato will knock it out of the park. Standing on a massive East Kelowna mountain, David Geen squints into the sunshine and surveys the landscape, his hands tucked into the front pockets of his jeans. A bulldozer transforms the grassy hillside, ribbed with massive dirt furrows, against a backdrop of tall, swaying pines. This barren, sandy plot will soon be a new orchard, part of a land lease designed to help Geen's family hold onto its position as one of Canada's largest producers and exporters of premium sweet cherries. Above this construction site is another established, fenced-in orchard with a long row of experimental new varieties, most bred at Summerland. They're thriving, with lush, serrated leaves flapping gently in the cool breeze. The fruit's fussiness makes growers like Geen hungry for hardier, more reliable cherry varieties. A really hot spell can cause cherries to stop growing for the year and shrivel on their stems. Heavy rain late in the season can ruin an entire crop: Surface moisture causes cherries to crack; once 40% have cracked, Geen says it's not worth sorting out the bad ones. During harvest, Geen's wife, Laura, stays up all night monitoring the weather. If she sees rain, she notifies Geen or one of his farm managers, and they call in the helicopters, which are flown by local pilots trained to fight forest fires. As many as 10 choppers descend on the wet orchards en masse, flying at 20 kilometres an hour, two metres above the treetops, blowing surface moisture from cherries with their powerful blades. ""It's kind of like a war zone out here,"" says Geen. ""But the varieties that have come out of Summerland, generally they get about half the level of rain cracking that the old standard varieties would get."" At the same time, farmers will drag giant fans or blowers into fields and try to save as many cherries as possible. ""I don't go to Vegas, ever, because I feel like I have a 600-acre casino,"" says Geen. ""I don't need any more risk."" Geen remembers the exact moment he knew it was time to double down on late-season cherries. It was in 2013, as he watched shipping containers of Staccato being opened in a giant wholesale produce market in Guangzhou, China. Geen stood in the crowded market as workers unloaded the first box of cherries. Within moments, a crowd of bidders snapped them up. ""They would sell out the minute they were opened,"" says Geen. Staccato had proven itself as a reliable long-distance traveller, and buyers were willing to pay premium prices for it. While Geen had shipped Staccato to Hong Kong and Taiwan before, he knew the mainland was different. ""China is the big enchilada,"" he says. A key attribute of the Staccato cherry is that it fruits much later than the competition in Washington State. David Geen of Jealous Fruits, is the largest grower of Summerland’s cherries in the Okanagan and the northernmost large-scale cherry producer in North America. His trees are planted at staggered altitude levels to produce cherries well into September Last February, the national Advisory Council on Economic Growth chaired by McKinsey &amp; Co. global managing partner Dominic Barton issued the second phase of its media-dubbed ""Barton Report."" The document focused on sectors capable of kick-starting the country's economy, and at the top of the list was agriculture and processed agri-food. As it notes, around three billion people in emerging markets are expected to enter the middle class between 2010 and 2030. Many of them will come into their new-found wealth in cherry-loving countries like China, Malaysia and Thailand. And while 2016's $13 million in exports to China pales against the $38 million that headed to the United States, Canadian cherry growers only secured access to that market four years ago. By proving to Chinese regulators that B.C. cherries were free of disease and pests, through what one grower calls ""a combination of bureaucracy and science,"" growers here got the green light to export. ""It's amazing how those cherry farmers are all of a sudden connected to parts of China they've probably never heard about,"" says Barton. Thanks in part to new markets in the Far East, total exports of B.C. sweet cherries have quadrupled since 2003, jumping from 2,031 metric tonnes to 9,392 metric tonnes in 2016. Sweet cherries are now British Columbia's most valuable tree-fruit crop, and the industry is still growing. Geen hopes to have access to the Japanese market by 2019, and South Korea soon after. ""Our whole business model is built on what Summerland has done,"" says Geen. ""The late varieties, the rain-resistant varieties, the really good eating varieties, the larger size—all those things they have been breeding into the cherries set us apart."" A reputation for a premium-quality, consistent product is something he thinks Canada should leverage as it enters preliminary free trade talks with countries like China and India. ""Even though cherries are a tiny crop in the grand scheme of things, they're also a flagship,"" he says. ""If we've got a very strong, diversified economy, having high-value specialty crops as one component of that, it makes us stronger as a country than if we're just the hewers of wood and drawers of water."" In 2010, Dominic Barton visited a Brazilian soybean farm so large he had to tour it by helicopter; it was 18 times the size of Manhattan. ""That two-day trip was like a slap in the head,"" he says. ""It was like being at NASA's Mission Control in Houston: big drones flying the property, how they plant and fertilize the fields with linked-up satellites. It's precision agriculture."" Brazil, like the Netherlands, is doing a better job at funding and encouraging collaboration between huge global food companies, federally funded researchers and its academic institutions, says Barton, which is one reason they're pulling ahead. Large-scale, modern agriculture is and will be a new kind of work, and it will not necessarily entail the nostalgia-toned, break-of-dawn wake-ups many associate with farming. A chance to move his family up the food chain inspires Geen. ""We've built up more than just a farm,"" he says. ""We grow the fruit; we also pack the fruit and sell the fruit. There's a lot of opportunity for my kids beyond just driving a tractor."" To encourage intergenerational mentorship, Barton says Canada needs a Rhodes-style scholarship aimed at promising young farmers and new strategies to attract more workers, particularly children from farming families, toward this increasingly high-tech work. Over the past five years, Canada has invested $3 billion in supporting agricultural innovation, upgrades and market expansion through its Growing Forward 2 program, which included $1 billion in federal initiatives and $2 billion of cost-shared projects with the provinces and territories. That money runs out in 2018 and will be replaced in April by another five-year, $3-billion program, aiming to grow Canada's exports to $75 billion by 2025. Yet a 2017 report by the Agricultural Institute of Canada found that ""total expenditures by the federal and provincial ministries of agriculture in support of the agriculture and agri-food sector as a whole have gradually declined over the past decade."" Despite ranking eighth worldwide in scientific production of agricultural research, Canada's number of patents has ""progressively dropped."" The Netherlands, by comparison, spends about twice as much public money on agricultural research each year, including funding universities and vocational schools—and that doesn't include investments from private corporations. Between 2004 and 2011, that country doubled its exported agriculture products, powered partially by, according to one Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report, ""a strong focus in finding means for producing more with less energy, water and space."" Perhaps Canada's abundant land and natural resources have made us complacent, Barton suggests, as more constrained countries like the Netherlands and Israel learn how to farm more productively using fewer inputs. Beyond this, the arguably harder, more nuanced work is in building and maintaining the ambition, shared priorities and tight, efficient relationships between researchers, private industry and federal institutions the Netherlands is well on its way to perfecting. One reason that country punches above its weight, says Barton, is because ""you've got researchers literally bumping into people in the ag-food companies who are saying, 'These are some problems we're trying to solve.' "" Collaboration can be challenging in a country as geographically large and diverse as Canada, but this is exactly Summerland's primordial mud: physical proximity, overlapping interests, and a willingness by private and public institutions to jump at informed opportunity. ""The Netherlands exports way more than we do,"" says Barton. ""I find that shocking. But it is, again, when people focus and collaborate more."" As global cherry breeders work to match Staccato's late season, Summerland growers are still aggressively introducing later, larger, tastier, hardier cherries. Geen is actively planting experimental varieties on new sites at unheard-of altitudes around the Okanagan Valley. One of his most promising new cherries is the late-season variety Cliff was taste-testing last year, called SPC276. It was bred in 1995 by Frank Kappel; Staccato is its parent. Two decades after Staccato's initial pollination, and years after its breeder's retirement, Summerland might, yet again, have a money-making, season-pushing, revolutionary fruit on its hands. But only time will tell. This story was supported by a Marian Hebb Research Grant from the Access Copyright Foundation. Research assistance by Sekou Hendrickson.

94,Democratic Hill veterans launch new firm,Eli Lilly adds GuidePostStrategies — Billboard lobby prepares for Oscar season,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2018/01/22/democratic-hill-veterans-launch-new-firm-079763,2018-01-22T19:38:57Z,"With David Beavers SHUTDOWN, WE HARDLY KNEW YE: “In a dramatic turnaround, Senate Democrats said they would vote to reopen the government on Monday after receiving a commitment from Republicans to hold a vote on immigration legislation — paving the way to end the three-day shutdown,” POLITICO ’s Seung Min Kim, Burgess Everett and Elana Schor report. “Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer agreed to end the shutdown and fund the government through Feb. 8 while continuing to negotiate on immigration and spending matters.” Story Continued Below — The weekend shutdown didn’t have much impact on K Street, said Steve Elmendorf, a prominent Democratic lobbyist, although he said he’d heard that there were lines around the block outside congressional office buildings this morning due to many entrances being closed. “A lot of the folks we would normally be interacting with at the agencies are either off or doing triple duty,” Elizabeth Gore, a lobbyist at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, said this morning before the deal was struck. NEW FIRM: Three former Democratic Hill staffers launched today a new lobbying shop called Emergent Strategies. Hayden Rogers, a former House candidate and chief of staff to Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Scott Eckart, former lead Democratic lobbyist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce who also worked for former Rep. Harold Ford Jr., and Hadley Sosnoff, former legislative director for former Rep. Walter Minnick (D-Idaho), will lead the new firm. The firm will include at least one other employee. The three partners worked together when Sosnoff was a partner at Majority Group, a boutique lobbying firm. — In an interview with PI, Rogers said he saw an opening for an all-Democratic firm because “Congress doesn’t work the way it used to” and that 2016 “was a reset.” Eckart said the firm recognizes that “in order to move legislation,” lobbying firms need to work with both congressional leadership as well as the newer members of Congress who “have a very different view than the generation above them.” Rogers said that the new firm won’t be limited to a specific policy area and touted the partners’ experiences working on a range of issues, including financial services, health care, energy and commerce. NEW BUSINESS: There’s a flood of end-of-quarter filings today. Here are a couple that stand out: Eli Lilly has added GuidePostStrategies to its stable of Washington lobbying firms. (The pharmaceutical giant, which spent $7 million on lobbying last year, also retains BGR Group ; Covington &amp; Burling ; Monument Policy Group ; the Simmons &amp; Russell Group ; Tarplin, Downs &amp; Young ; Venn Strategies ; and Williams &amp; Jensen. Eli Lilly recently parted ways with Robert Armitage, the Ingram Group and the McManus Group, according to disclosure filings.) And Marla Grossman has signed the Motion Picture Association of America and News Corporation. Good afternoon, and welcome to PI. Some personnel news: POLITICO ’s Marianne LeVine is joining me on the lobbying and influence beat and will co-author PI. Marianne has covered labor policy for POLITICO since 2014. You may remember the scoop she landed last year when she obtained a 1990 episode of “The Oprah Winfrey Show” on which the ex-wife of Andy Puzder, President Donald Trump ’s pick for Labor secretary, accused him of spousal abuse. Puzder withdrew his nomination hours later.

BILLBOARD LOBBY GETS READY FOR OSCAR SEASON: The Outdoor Advertising Association of America is using the award-season buzz around the film “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” to “underscore the cultural connections between movies and signage,” according to Ken Klein, executive vice president of government affairs for the trade group. In January, prior to the Golden Globes, member companies in New York, California and North Carolina devoted billboard space to promoting the film, with messages such as, “This billboard deserves an award.” All of the billboards are digital, and the space for the billboards was donated. In light of tomorrow’s Oscar nominations announcement, Klein said that the billboard messages will switch to “This billboard deserves an Oscar.” In addition to drawing the connection “between motion pictures and signs,” Klein said the campaign to promote the movie shows Hollywood that “we like to have fun and we’re rooting for a film with ‘billboard’ in the title.” TIMES EDITORIAL DECRIES INFLUENCE OF LOBBYISTS: An editorial in The New York Times today with the headline “Lobbyists Romp in Trump’s Washington” accuses Trump of spending the first year of his presidency beholden to lobbyists and special interests. “Mr. Trump has become such a Washington creature that he’s rooting for a return to earmarks, that opaque process in which legislators direct federal spending to their home districts and pet projects, like Republican Representative Don Young of Alaska’s failed 'bridge to nowhere,' a plan to waste more than $300 million on a mammoth bridge to an Alaska island of 50 inhabitants,” the editorial board writes. Here’s the full editorial. IF YOU MISSED IT THIS WEEKEND: USA Today ’s Trevor Hughes reports that marijuana “business owners are increasingly pouring their profits into lobbying lawmakers as they face a federal crackdown from the Trump administration.” They’re also becoming bigger campaign donors. "" John Lord, the CEO of Colorado-based LivWell Enlightened Health, whose company employs more than 600 people, has donated nearly $23,000 to federal lawmakers in the past four years, and another $10,000 to Colorado politicians and issue committees. Increasingly he’s been giving to Republicans at the federal level. ‘It would be rather imprudent if I didn’t,’ Lord said.” Full story. JOBS REPORT — Brian Cornell, the chairman and chief executive of Target, will be the next chairman of the Retail Industry Leaders Association, the trade group announced today at its Retail CEO Forum in Tucson, Ariz. Mitt Romney is scheduled to address the gathering later today. — Mike Joyce has joined Total Spectrum/Steve Gordon &amp; Associates as a partner. He was previously senior vice president and chief of legislative affairs at the American Trucking Associations. — David London has joined ofo, which describes itself as “the world’s first and largest station-free bike sharing platform,” as a senior director and the head of North America government affairs. He previously spent more than a decade at eBay, where he rose to become head of government relations for the Americas. NEW JOINT FUNDRAISERS: None NEW PACs: Annaly Capital Management, Inc.

95,"NAFTA talks make progress, slowly","Nutrition Facts update still in flux — How dicamba, a professor and a private jet connect — Regulatory rollback criticized",https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-agriculture/2018/01/30/nafta-talks-make-progress-slowly-086797,2018-01-30T15:00:55Z,"With Sabrina Rodriguez, Helena Bottemiller Evich, Catherine Boudreau and Maya Parthasarathy SLOW AND STEADY NAFTA PROGRESS: As the sixth round of trade discussions ended on Monday, U.S Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer expressed some aggravation about the halting headway, and he rejected some proposals Canada made. But he remained hopeful that this latest round at least made a “step forward” and started conversations about “some of the core issues,” reported Pro Trade’s Doug Palmer and Adam Behsudi. Story Continued Below What was accomplished: Lighthizer, who bluntly noted that talks have been “progressing very slowly,” seemed positive about how negotiators completed a chapter on anti-corruption. Mexican Economy Secretary Ildefonso Guajardo said chapters on food-safety measures, digital trade and telecommunications were about 90 percent complete, and there would be a strong effort to close them during the seventh round in Mexico City. What’s up with seasonal produce talks? Little movement has been made on the produce proposal, which both Canada and Mexico oppose because it makes it easier for growers to argue that Mexico is selling produce at uncompetitively low prices when crops like avocados and strawberries are in season in a particular region. “The topic of seasonality wasn’t tackled directly beyond us reiterating that for Mexico the proposal is a complete non-starter,” Guajardo told reporters. All in the timing: The plodding nature of the talks has led some trade policy experts to predict that the negotiations could stretch into 2019. But Lighthizer, a self-describe curmudgeon, said it was encouraging that Canada and Mexico were ""starting to realize that we have to begin to talk.” The boss chimes in: President Donald Trump said that tonight’s State of the Union would be “a very important speech on trade"" according to pool reports. ""The world has taken advantage of us on trade for many years, and, as you probably noticed, we're stopping that, and we're stopping it cold,"" Trump told reporters. How NAFTA talks tie back to your burger: The Washington Post describes how the latest talks directly affect your hamburger, fries and condiments - like beef which passes through Canada, the U.S. and Mexico before reaching American plates. HAPPY TUESDAY, JAN. 30! Welcome to Morning Ag, where your host hopes our ag friends who headed to Montreal for NAFTA talks tasted some of the city’s great bagels. Got any great Montreal food stories or news tips to share? Please send them my way to chaughney@politico.com and @chaughney. Follow the team at @Morning_Ag. ** A message from the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine: Americans relying on SNAP deserve healthy food. But the program also subsidizes junk food, which contributes to SNAP participants’ higher risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. A “Healthy Staples” SNAP would lower these risks by providing more fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes—while saving billions of taxpayer dollars. www.PCRM.org/SNAP ** PROGRAMMING NOTE: Be sure to follow POLITICO’s coverage of the State of the Union address online or on your app. Here’s a helpful rundown about what to expect. And POLITICO’s Brianna Gurciullo details on how business and industry groups hope that tonight’s talk will foreshadow Trump’s plans to invest in U.S. infrastructure. NUTRITION FACTS UPDATE STILL IN FLUX: Many food industry leaders and labeling consultants remain apprehensive about how the FDA’s update to Nutrition Facts label is going to work — even with the 18-month extension the agency recently granted. That was the vibe at a Q1 Food Labeling conference in Arlington, Va., on Monday. The industry has largely come to accept the added sugars disclosure, updated serving sizes, and the extra large font for calories, among other things. But there are other nettlesome issues that remain unknown. Let’s talk about fiber: As part of the FDA's update to the Nutrition Facts label, the agency has raised the bar for what counts as ""dietary fiber,"" stipulating that the ingredient must have a proven health benefit. The agency is currently reviewing the science for 26 substances to see which ingredients will qualify. It’s a big issue for just about any food company using these ingredients, especially if it is to give a fiber boost to their products. The largest manufacturers must start complying by Jan. 2020. Fiber clarity coming: Doug Balentine, director of FDA's Office of Nutrition and Food Labeling, assured the audience on Monday that agency was well aware that many food companies have lots of questions about which types of fiber will actually count as “dietary fiber” under the new rules. Be patient, y’all: ""Fiber is clearly one of the biggest priorities we have to get wrapped up,"" Balentine said, after speaking at the conference. ""We talk about it every day. We know everybody really wants to know what the deal is with fiber,"" he said. ""Be patient. We're working on it."" A TALE OF DICAMBA, GMOs AND A PRIVATE JET: It’s a question that’s been buzzing in ag circles: How did a professor from North Dakota get to a November hearing to testify before the Arkansas Plant Board in Little Rock, which helped lead to a ban of the weedkiller dicamba in the state from April through October? Richard K. Zollinger, a retired North Dakota State University professor, said during a conference in Fargo on Jan. 16 that after a chemist wrote an anonymous letter to the Arkansas Plant Board saying that he was too afraid for his career to comment about dicamba, that the board invited him instead. A news report in AgWeek contended that the plant board had “sent a jet” to fetch the professor to speak at the hearing. Private what? The prospect of a speaker being shuttled to an Arkansas hearing on a government-paid private jet riled up folks in the Twittersphere who have been following the contentious battle. Adriane Barnes, an Arkansas Plant Board spokeswoman, said an email to POLITICO that she confirmed with the board’s fiscal director that “we absolutely did not fund a flight for Mr. Zollinger for the November public hearing.” Answer to the mystery: On Monday afternoon, Ed Fryar, chief executive of Ozark Mountain Poultry, contacted your host to say that it was he who had offered to fly Zollinger to the hearing on his company’s eight-seater turboprop plane. He said that he had invited Zollinger to speak because he was having trouble finding local farmers to sell him the non-GMO soybeans that he needed to continue raising his chickens free of genetically modified ingredients. “We have a problem buying non-GMO soybeans because farmers are afraid to plant non-GMO soybeans because they are all susceptible to dicamba,” said Fryar. When the ban is in place, and he is hopeful that farmers are going to be able to supply him with non-GMO soybean feed. Nebraska won’t go as far: In other dicamba news, the Omaha World-Herald reported that Nebraska wouldn’t go beyond the EPA’s rules — such as by implementing a full-fledged ban like in Arkansas. Looking ahead: The Arkansas fight may not be quite over. Monsanto, which markets dicamba, has filed a lawsuit in Pulaski County Circuit Court in Arkansas, arguing that the Plant Board went beyond its authority in prohibiting use of the weedkiller. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Feb. 16. The dicamba spraying ban is scheduled to begin April 16 in the state. REPORT SAYS REGULATORY ROLLBACK HARMS FOOD SYSTEM: The Food Policy Action Education Fund released a report on Monday criticizing regulatory changes carried out by the Trump administration in the last year. The organization’s first annual report, titled ""State of the Plate,"" outlines 22 actions that the organization says hurt the U.S. food system. The assertions: The report contends that access to “safe and healthy food is under attack,” while progress in fisheries management and protections for clean water are being unraveled. The report also said that standards governing fair market competition for farmers and ag workers’ rights had been weakened. The report cites many USDA decisions, including giving schools leeway on nutrition standards in the National School Lunch Program and withdrawing rules intended to balance power between contract livestock farmers and meatpacking companies. FDA's decision to delay by 18 months the compliance date for the updated Nutrition Facts panel (see second item above) also made the list. At EPA, the report cites the reversal of a planned ban on the pesticide chlorpyrifos, which research suggests may cause developmental delays in children who are exposed to it. The Trump administration’s agenda on issues like trade and immigration is working against sustainable farming practices, said Ricardo Salvador, director of the food and environment program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. In order to be successful, farmers need fair markets, economic incentives, an adequate labor pool and a set of policies and business practices to back them up, he said. He contends that the administration’s moves promote monopolies, which will raise prices, reduce choices for farmers, and worsen working conditions on farms. USDA, FDA and EPA media representatives did not return requests for comment.

But SNAP subsidizes foods high in sugar, saturated fat, and sodium that the USDA itself says to avoid. That puts them at risk for diabetes, heart disease, and other problems. The American Medical Association has asked that SNAP promote healthful foods and eliminate unhealthful foods. The “Healthy Staples” plan—which would pay participating grocers to supply healthful vegetables, fruits, beans, grains, and even healthful multivitamins—could help achieve this goal. Participants choosing solely from the “Healthy Staples” plan would get more health-promoting nutrients than from a typical American diet. They would also consume 65 percent less fat, 85 percent less saturated fat, and essentially zero cholesterol. The plan could also save the USDA up to $26 billion a year. That means better food for more people for less money.

97,"Amid marijuana boom, cost data leave analysts dazed and confused",Margins could shrink as provinces start to purchase wholesale,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investment-ideas/amid-marijuana-boom-cost-data-leave-analysts-dazed-and-confused/article36970490/,2017-11-14T14:35:21Z,"If there's one thing that's still hazy in Canada's nascent marijuana market, it's how wide the margins are on that dime bag. With less than nine months left before recreational cannabis becomes legal in the country, analysts and investors are still unclear who the big winners and losers will be. Some publicly traded pot companies don't report how much a gram of dried bud costs them to make and if they do, the numbers aren't uniformly calculated. Moreover, producer margins could start to shrink as provinces start to purchase pot wholesale. Selling prices ""will certainly cut in half perhaps from what they are now, and cost of production will matter,"" said Mike Gorenstein, chief executive officer of Toronto-based Cronos Group Inc. ""It's not going to be 80 or 90-per-cent margins forever."" Story continues below advertisement The pending margin squeeze comes as investor optimism over recreational sales has sent valuations soaring. Canopy Growth Corp., the country's first marijuana unicorn with a market cap of more than $3-billion, has seen its share price rise more than 80 percent in the past 12 months, while Aurora Cannabis Inc. more than doubled. MedReleaf Corp. is up more than 90 per cent since its June debut. Medical marijuana is currently sold direct to consumers for about $7 to $12 a gram, depending on quality. Prices for recreational pot could probably drop to $4.50 to $5 as provinces such as Ontario and Alberta plan to purchase marijuana wholesale, said Jason Zandberg, an analyst with PI Financial in Vancouver. No Standard What the price drop will do to margins is nebulous because there isn't an industry standard for reporting production costs, said Vahan Ajamian, an analyst at Beacon Securities Ltd. in Toronto. For example, it's difficult to determine whether Canopy Growth's reported costs of $2.78 a gram are being calculated the same way as MedReleaf's $1.46. Companies will probably disclose even less information about their costs of production in the coming months as producers competing for supply contracts will want to maintain a competitive edge, Zandberg of PI Financial said. It's difficult to look at an earnings statement and try to extrapolate which companies will be successful in five years when looking at cash flow, earnings and price-to-earnings ratios, he said. Some producers are focusing on lowering costs in order to help maintain robust margins. Leamington, Ont.-based Aphria Inc.'s cash costs per gram were 95 Canadian cents last quarter and further cost efficiencies are pending so the company will be ""in the driver's seat"" in terms of lowering the selling price without sacrificing margins, CEO Vic Neufeld said in an interview. Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement Companies are also looking to geographic diversity to make up for price declines in Canada. Other Markets ""If a particular province sets wholesale prices too low, that's OK, we have options,"" said Aurora Cannabis Executive Vice President Cam Battley, noting global demand exceeds supply and the company owns a medical distributor in the European Union and is paid a premium for its products in Germany. ""We're in a sense inoculated against anything we don't like."" Canopy Growth expects provinces to purchase bulk products at a price ""pretty close"" to the current average in the medical market, said CEO Bruce Linton. While there will be some short-term pressure, the company has multiple markets, including medical and international, and is focused on different forms of marijuana that can eventually be sold at a higher margin, such as infused beverages, he said. ""This is a transitional thing,"" Linton said by phone. ""Over time, we can maintain our margins creating evolved products."" Large producers that have established and expanded their operations to lower their costs will continue to do well along with smaller craft growers that can sell their products at a higher price, Cronos Group's Gorenstein said. Companies that are still trying to raise capital to expand their operations may have a tough time competing. There will come a point when supply meets demand, and ""there will be a very rapid price compression,"" he said. Story continues below advertisement If margins shrink, companies that will be successful will need to make up the difference on volumes, said Chris Damas, editor of the BCMI Report in Barrie, Ontario.

98,Special Report: Appetite for destruction - Soy boom devours Brazil's tropical savanna,"When farmer Julimar Pansera purchased land in Brazil's interior seven years ago, it was blanketed in tiers of fruit trees, twisted shrubs and the occasional palm standing tall in a thicket of undergrowth.",https://in.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-deforestation-specialreport/special-report-appetite-for-destruction-soy-boom-devours-brazils-tropical-savanna-idINKCN1LD16B,2018-08-28T11:12:09Z,"CAMPOS LINDOS, Brazil (Reuters) - When farmer Julimar Pansera purchased land in Brazil’s interior seven years ago, it was blanketed in tiers of fruit trees, twisted shrubs and the occasional palm standing tall in a thicket of undergrowth. He mowed down most of that vegetation, set it ablaze and started planting soybeans. Over the past decade, he and others in the region have deforested an area larger than South Korea. Permissive land-use policies and cheap farm acreage here have helped catapult Brazil into an agricultural superpower, the world’s largest exporter of soy, beef and chicken and a major producer of pork and corn. This area has also lured farmers and ranchers away from the Amazon jungle, whose decline has spurred a global outcry to protect it. The tradeoff, environmentalists say, is that while Brazil has slowed destruction of the renowned rainforest from its worst levels, it has put another vital ecological zone at risk: a vast tropical savanna that is home to 5 percent of species on the planet. Known as the Cerrado, this habitat lost more than 105,000 square kilometers (40,541 square miles) of native cover since 2008, according to government figures. That’s 50 percent more than the deforestation seen during the same period in the Amazon, a biome more than three times larger. Accounting for relative size, the Cerrado is disappearing nearly four times faster than the rainforest. The largest savanna in South America, the Cerrado is a vital storehouse for carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas whose rising emissions from fossil fuels and deforestation are warming the world’s atmosphere. Brazilian officials have cited protection of native vegetation as critical to meeting its obligations under the Paris Agreement on climate change. But scientists warn the biome has reached a tipping point that could hamper Brazil’s efforts and worsen global warming. By focusing on one problem, Brazil essentially created another, said Ane Alencar, science director of the non-profit Amazon Environmental Research Institute, known as IPAM. “There’s a high risk for the climate associated with this expansion,” Alencar said. “Limiting and calling attention to deforestation in the Amazon, in a way it forced the agribusiness industry to expand in the Cerrado.” The toll can already be seen in the region’s water resources. Streams and springs are filling with silt and drying up as vegetation around them vanishes. That in turn is weakening the headwaters of vital rivers flowing to the rest of the country, scientists say. The imperiled waterways include the Sao Francisco, Brazil’s longest river outside the Amazon, where water levels are hitting never-before-seen lows in the dry season. “The removal of vegetation can lead a body of water to extinction,” said Liliana Pena Naval, an environmental engineering professor at the Federal University of Tocantins. Wildlife, too, is under threat, including rare hyacinth macaws, maned wolves and jaguars that call the shrinking savanna home. So are thousands of plants, fish, insects and other creatures found nowhere else on earth, many of which are only beginning to be studied. “I compare it to the burning of the ancient Library of Alexandria,” said Mercedes Bustamante, an ecologist at the University of Brasilia. “You lose the accumulated evolutionary record of thousands of years that never can be recovered.” Farmers see the Cerrado’s development as critical to global food security and their nation’s prosperity. Brazil’s agriculture sector grew a sizzling 13 percent in 2017, while the overall economy barely budged. The nation’s ability to keep producing new farmland cheaply has given it an edge over rivals and cemented its status as a vital supplier to the world’s tables. “Imagine, if not for Brazil’s production, how much more hunger would there be,” farmer Pansera said. THE GREEN REVOLUTION Roughly the size of Mexico, straddling Brazil’s mid-section from its far western borders with Paraguay and stretching northeast towards the Atlantic coast, the Cerrado has seen about half of its native forests and grasslands converted to farms, pastures and urban areas over the past 50 years. Deforestation in the region has slowed from the early 2000s, when Brazil’s soy boom was gaining steam. Still, farmers continue to plow under vast stretches of the biome, propelled largely by Chinese demand for Brazilian meat and grain. The Asian nation is Brazil’s No. 1 buyer of soybeans to fatten its own hogs and chickens. China is also a major purchaser of Brazilian pork, beef and poultry to satisfy the tastes of its increasingly affluent consumers. Rising trade tensions between China and the United States have only deepened that connection. Brazil’s soybean exports by value to China are up 18 percent through the first seven months of the year as Chinese buyers have canceled tens of millions of dollars’ worth of contracts with U.S. suppliers. The trend bodes well for producers in the Cerrado’s frontier region known as Matopiba, shorthand for the northeastern Brazilian states of Maranhao, Tocantins, Piaui and Bahia. Land here is cheap. Virgin plots near Pansera in the state of Tocantins can be had for $248 an acre on average, according to agribusiness consultancy Informa Economics IEG FNP. That compares to an average of $3,080 per acre for already cleared farmland in the United States. Soy planting in Matopiba has more than doubled over the past decade. Pansera, 50, is part of a wave of industrious transplants from southern Brazil who are remaking the region. His formal education stopped at middle school, but he found land enough in the Cerrado to match his big ambitions. He now presides over nearly 19 square miles (49 square kilometers) of manicured soy fields and has about 20 full-time workers on his payroll. Pansera’s soybeans will bring in an estimated profit of nearly 5 million reais ($1.23 million) this year, most of which he plans to invest back into the farm. Government policies have intentionally driven industrial-scale farming here. Short on farmland to feed its growing population, Brazil in the 1970s looked to its vast savanna, a region early explorers had dubbed “cerrado,” or “closed,” because of its tangled woodlands. State agriculture scientists developed fertilizers and additives to fix the acidic, nutrient-poor earth and created soybean strains that could thrive in the tropics. Arable land exploded. Within a decade, Brazil transformed itself from a food importer to a net exporter. By the 1990s it was moving global commodities markets. “Agriculture in the Cerrado is what took Brazil to the next level,” Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi told Reuters. Known as Brazil’s “Soy King,” Maggi is a billionaire whose family runs one of the largest private soybean operations in the world, much of it in the Cerrado. Maggi said growers are respectful of legally allowed limits on deforestation. Their “rational” occupation of the Cerrado has helped Brazil’s economy, he said. Farmers have emerged as a powerful political force bent on keeping Brazil’s countryside open for business. Lawmakers in the country’s largely rural, pro-agriculture voting bloc, who comprise more than 40 percent of the nation’s congress, have led a rollback of environmental laws in recent years. Those efforts include a 2012 loosening of Brazil’s landmark Forest Code that sets requirements for preserving native vegetation. The change reduced potential penalties for farmers, ranchers and loggers charged with past illegal deforestation, and made it easier for landowners to clear more of their holdings. Annual deforestation in the Amazon last year was up 52 percent from a record low in 2012. Still, environmental protections there remain the most robust in Brazil. Rainforest farmers are required by law to preserve 80 percent of native vegetation on their plots. And global grain traders in 2006 voluntarily agreed to stop purchasing any soy harvested from newly deforested Amazon jungle areas. As part of its obligations under the Paris Agreement, the government pledged to eliminate illegal Amazon deforestation by 2030. Brazil has made no similar push to preserve the Cerrado, which has long been viewed as a resource to be developed. Cerrado farmers are required to preserve as little as 20 percent of the natural cover, and up to 35 percent in areas neighboring the Amazon. Those who don’t maximize use of their tracts risk having their land declared idle and subject to redistribution under a 1980 federal land-reform initiative aimed at assisting rural, low-income people, said Elvison Nunes Ramos, sustainability coordinator with the Ministry of Agriculture. “The message being sent to the farmer is that he should not preserve, he should deforest,” Nunes Ramos said of the policy. A spokesman for Incra, the government agency that verifies the use of the rural land, said its job is to ensure “the fulfillment of the social function of the property.” WATER, WILDLIFE UNDER THREAT Environmentalists say the Cerrado’s wooded grasslands have failed to capture the public’s attention the way the Amazon’s lush jungles have. People view the Cerrado “just as bushes, twisted vegetation and shrubs,” lamented Alencar, the science director at IPAM. What many don’t see, she said, is the connection between the soybean-fed meat on their plates and the steady decline of one of the world’s great carbon sinks, a bulwark against global warming. Plants here send roots deep into the earth to survive seasonal drought and fires, creating a vast underground network that some have likened to an upside-down forest. Destruction of surface vegetation, and the resulting die-off of the life below, released 248 million tonnes of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere in 2016, according to estimates by the Climate Observatory, a Brazilian conservation group. That’s roughly two-and-a-half times the annual tailpipe emissions from all cars in Brazil. Watersheds are hurting, too. In Palmeirante, a rural municipality in the state of Tocantins, subsistence farmer Ronivon Matias de Andrade blames expanding mega-farms for damaging a community water source. Dressed in faded shorts and flip flops, he showed a visitor the remains of what until recently had been a shady woodland: uprooted trees and freshly exposed earth pocked with heavy-equipment tracks. Stripped of its vegetation, sandy topsoil is now filling a nearby creek and an adjoining freshwater pool where he and other rural families draw drinking water. He scooped up a murky handful in disgust. “How many are being finished off in this manner in this state?” 43-year-old Andrade said. Environmentalists say vanishing creeks like those in Palmeirante are threatening the nation’s water supply. Seemingly insignificant sources - tiny brooks, nameless rivulets - are vital building blocks supplying water to tributary streams that in turn feed some of Brazil’s largest rivers. Of a dozen major water systems in Brazil, eight are born in the Cerrado. They include the Sao Francisco, the country’s fourth-largest river, which was once famed for its paddle-wheeled riverboats known as gaiolas. Environmentalists say man-made diversions, including agriculture and hydroelectric dams, have helped alter water levels to a degree that long stretches of the river are now unnavigable during the dry season. Loss of native ground cover is also driving microclimate change in the region, they say. Reduced vegetation leads to higher ground temperatures and lower humidity, a recipe for less rainfall. A study conducted at the University of Brasilia links deforestation to an 8.4 percent drop in precipitation from 1977 to 2010 in the Cerrado. Cerrado wildlife is under pressure as habitat shrinks. More than 300 species that dwell here are considered threatened with extinction, according to the government. Among them are 44 rare types of “annual fish” unique to the Cerrado whose short lives begin with spring rains and end with the summer heat. Scientists suspect that increasing dry spells could be interrupting their delicate reproduction cycles. Other creatures, including rheas - giant ostrich-like birds – will soon join the endangered species list if nothing is done to reverse the slide, says Ricardo Machado, a zoology professor at the University of Brasilia. He said the birds’ numbers have plummeted due to loss of native ground cover critical to breeding and nesting. Machado worries that unique Cerrado plants, insects and other creatures may vanish before scientists have an opportunity to identify them, much less study them. “There is a universe to be discovered,” Machado said. “All attention is focused on the Amazon, no one speaks for the Cerrado.” REINING IN THE SOY BOOM That’s beginning to change. Dozens of groups, including Greenpeace, the World Wildlife Foundation and the Brazilian research group IPAM, last year began pushing for large multinationals to protect the biome. In a document known as the Cerrado Manifesto, they called for immediate action to stop deforestation in the region. More than 60 companies, including McDonalds, Unilever and Walmart, have signed on so far. The firms have agreed to support measures that would eliminate native vegetation loss in the Cerrado from their supply chains. But in contrast to the 2006 Amazon soy moratorium, the Cerrado Manifesto did not commit signatories to halt purchases of farm products from newly deforested areas. Walmart and Unilever said they are committed to achieving zero net deforestation in their supply chains by 2020, meaning any destruction in one region would be offset by recuperation of similar forest elsewhere. Walmart said all its beef suppliers in the Cerrado are monitored to ensure they don’t contribute to deforestation there. McDonalds didn’t respond to a request for comment. Separately, Netherlands-based Louis Dreyfus Company in June became the first major commodity trader to pledge to stop buying soy from newly deforested land specifically in the Cerrado. The company gave no timetable, but said it would work to establish a “realistic target date” to end deforestation in its Cerrado supply chain. Brazil’s former Minister of Environment Jose Sarney Filho, who recently left office to run for Senate, has proposed an international effort to compensate landowners who preserve natural habitat. He raised the issue at last November’s global climate summit in Germany, but the effort has yet to attract major backers. Farmer Pansera, meanwhile, sees big things ahead for his patch of the Cerrado. Supervising the harvest on his land earlier this year, he watched a pair of combines chew through rows of soybean plants. The giant machines stripped away the beans and spit them into empty grain trucks rolling just behind to catch the bounty.

99,North Carolinians create stink over hog farms,"China’s tariffs on U.S. pork, fruit and wine get real — Livestock farmers describe harm in pulling GIPSA rules",https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-agriculture/2018/04/02/north-carolinians-create-stink-over-hog-farms-156205,2018-04-02T14:00:50Z,"With Liz Crampton, Catherine Boudreau and Maya Parthasarathy NORTH CAROLINIANS CREATE STINK OVER HOG FARMS: A federal case over the stench emanating from pig farms in North Carolina has been weaving its way through the court system for years, culminating today in what will be the start of a monthlong trial. Story Continued Below Rural residents in eastern North Carolina complain that the smell from industrial pig farming is a nuisance, Pro Ag’s Liz Crampton reports. The legal definition of ‘nuisance’ means the use and enjoyment of their property has been curtailed. In 2014, hundreds of residents sued Murphy-Brown, a subsidiary of the world’s largest pork company Smithfield, and a judge has split the cases into eight trial groups (more of which could be added). Waste lagoons: Animal waste at these farms sits in open-air lagoons, which the residents say amounts to an “unflushed toilet.” The waste is sprayed onto fields as a fertilizer. That system was developed in the 1960s and ’70s and works for North Carolina farms, the pork industry says. But residents say that the problem is more than just smell -- waste drifts off from the fields and coats nearby homes, posing a health risk. Basis of economy: Hog farming is big business in North Carolina, employing about 46,000 people. Smithfield warns that a losing verdict could imperil its future in the state. Company lawyers say residents’ complaints are overblown, and other businesses in the area -- such as an Arabian horse farm and a local bed and breakfast -- don’t have problems with the farms. Schedule of events: Jury selection in the first case begins today in Raleigh. The judge has cleared his calendar for the entire year to accommodate the rest of the cases. Testifying witnesses will include residents and experts presenting opposing scientific evidence. It’s possible that the outcome of this case could result in settlement in the other seven cases. Liz will keep MA readers updated on the developments. HAPPY MONDAY, APRIL 2!

Learn more at FairSugarPolicy.org. ** CHINA’S TARIFFS ON U.S. PORK, FRUIT AND WINE GET REAL: Well, that didn’t take long. China is moving forward with its plan to retaliate against the Trump administration’s new tariffs on steel and aluminum, levying duties that take effect today on more than $3 billion in U.S. exports to the country. That means a 15 percent tariff increase on products such as fresh fruit, dried fruits and nuts, wine, modified ethanol and American ginseng. Pork and a few other American goods will face a 25 percent tariff increase, Pro Trade’s Megan Cassella reports. China, the No. 2 purchaser of U.S. farm goods, argued in a statement that it would be imposing the duties “in order to safeguard China’s interest and balance the losses caused by” the steel and aluminum tariffs, which took effect late last month. The move to officially impose the duties comes just a week after the Chinese Commerce Ministry had announced it was considering slapping retaliatory tariffs on 128 products. By the numbers: The U.S. shipped more than $1 billion of pork products to China last year, making it the No. 3 destination for exports after Japan and Mexico. China has also been a major buyer of U.S. apples, cherries, walnuts and almonds. “This could not be happening at a worse time for American agriculture,” American Farm Bureau President Zippy Duvall told POLITICO recently. “Farm income across commodities has fallen by about 50 percent over the past four years. Retaliation in the trade arena makes our outlook even worse.” What’s next? It remains unclear why Beijing decided to put in place the tariffs, after the Chinese government said last week that it was hoping to resolve issues with the U.S. through a 30-day period of consultation at the World Trade Organization. The U.S. argues the steel and aluminum tariffs are necessary for national security, but China has said that it sees the tariffs as a safeguard measure, which could allow Beijing’s tariffs to compensate for the U.S.’s export restrictions. More retaliation could be coming soon: Farmers and ranchers continue to worry that additional retaliatory measures aimed at U.S. agriculture are on the way. President Donald Trump’s administration is expected to release this week a list of goods that it wants to impose on as much as $60 billion in Chinese imports because of concern about intellectual property theft in China and forced technology transfers. LIVESTOCK FARMERS DESCRIBE HARM IN PULLING GIPSA RULES: Livestock farmers from Alabama, Nebraska and Kansas outlined in a court brief last week why they support an ongoing lawsuit against Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue that seeks a judicial review of the withdrawal of two rules aimed at balancing the power between meatpacking companies and contract growers — better know as the GIPSA rules. Alabama poultry farmers Jonathan and Connie Buttram are both plaintiffs in the case that was brought by Democracy Forward, a nonprofit legal group, on behalf of the Organization for Competitive Markets. The GIPSA rules, if they had been finalized, would have confirmed that the major poultry companies terminating contracts with Mr. Buttram’s farms in retaliation to his advocacy efforts constituted a violation of the Packers and Stockyards Act. Similarly, Kansas cattle producer Mike Callicrate, who is not a plaintiff in the case, has experienced retaliatory and discriminatory treatment, which he more easily could have challenged in court had the interim final rules not been pulled. At the time of his decision, Perdue said the rules would have invited “unnecessary and unproductive litigation.” The secretary also said the USDA will watch out for contract growers, individually and collectively, to ensure they aren’t disadvantaged by unfair, uncompetitive rules. FARM BILL CAN DO MORE TO FIGHT FOOD INSECURITY: The next farm bill should increase SNAP funding to continue helping low-income families and better combat food insecurity, according to a set of reports by the Farm Bill Law Enterprise, a national partnership of law school programs working toward a better farm bill. Congress should keep SNAP’s structure rather than move to a block grant program, which would “disproportionately harm recipients living in states with budget shortfalls, as these states may be more likely to shift block grant funds away from food assistance toward other state-run programs,” the report explains. Increased SNAP benefits would also offer more money to local communities, the report adds. Push for healthier food purchases: The next farm bill should establish a pilot program that links nutrition programs and health outcomes in an effort to improve the health of low-income individuals dealing with serious diseases, the report recommends. Such an effort would offer funding “to community-based nutrition resource organizations to provide medically appropriate meals or food packages to low-income people living with serious health conditions,” the report said. Bipartisan support: In January, a small bipartisan working group – led by Reps. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), Lynn Jenkins (R-Kan.), Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) – was launched with a similar goal, marking a step toward finding better ways to link agriculture and health policy. McGovern mentioned then that the group might take up policies such as looking at “medically tailored” meals to help people fight disease. More on the reports: The two other reports focus on productivity and risk management -- including how to improve farmer and producer access to credit, markets and land. The three reports were published by eight law school programs at six universities – Duke, Harvard, Pace, UCLA, Vermont and Yale.

The grants go toward: ensuring doctors’ offices and pharmacies are connected to real-time controlled substances registries; training health care providers on how to identify and treat addiction; and providing addiction treatment remotely. — Trump targets NAFTA over Mexican immigration: President Donald Trump threatened to target the “cash cow” of the North American Free Trade Agreement if Mexico does not do more to help the U.S. address illegal immigration, POLITICO’s Brent Griffiths reports. In a Sunday tweet, Trump said that Mexico “must stop the big drug and people flows, or I will stop their cash cow, NAFTA. NEED WALL!” — Federal workers spill on life in Trump’s Washington: Interviews with nearly three dozen current and recently departed employees show that Trump’s presidency has affected the lives of government workers in ways big and small.

While Conaway declined to go into specifics, he said his offer demonstrates he’s “willing to move off House positions, but it’s got to make sense,” he told reporters Tuesday evening. Story Continued Below Bridging the divide between the SNAP proposals in the House bill, H.R. 2 (115), which were rejected by Democrats, and the Senate’s bipartisan approach, which would leave the program’s existing work requirements in place, is the great test facing the conference committee. “I wanted to make sure the other three knew that I’m willing to make significant changes to the House bill to get this done,” Conaway said, referring to House Ag ranking member Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) and Senate Agriculture leader Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) and top Democrat Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.). Conaway added that the lawmakers came back with “some dollar changes” late last week that weren’t as comprehensive as he’d like, and said he’s waiting on their counteroffer on specific policy changes. The Texas Republican noted that Congress has less than 10 legislative days to reach a compromise on the farm bill and pass it through both chambers before the Sept. 30 deadline. But he expressed confidence it could be done.

FARM GROUPS TO USDA: SHOW ME THE DATA: The National Corn Growers Association and National Association of Wheat Growers are requesting that USDA share more information about the methodology officials used to determine the amount of money per bushel each crop will get under the trade assistance package. The groups are disappointed with the payment rates for corn and wheat — set at a penny per bushel and seven cents per bushel, respectively — that the department announced last week. NAWG officials estimate losses of 75 cents a bushel due to the retaliatory tariffs by China and Mexico. They are planning to meet with USDA next week during their annual fly-in, said Caitlin Eannello, the group’s spokeswoman. NCGA has reported losses of 44 cents per bushel for corn growers. Spokeswoman Liz Friedlander said the group has asked USDA for more information about its methodology. The USDA Office of the Chief Economist did not return a request for comment on whether it plans to publicly disclose how officials arrived at the payment rates for each commodity that will receive direct assistance, including soybeans, sorghum, cotton, corn, wheat, pork and dairy. Payments will total $4.7 billion. At a later date, the department will determine if more aid is necessary. FOIA filed: The Environmental Working Group last week announced it had filed a FOIA request seeking documents that shed light on how the multi-billion dollar trade assistance program was developed. It wants relevant e-mails, text messages, meeting logs and informational material. Regional politics: Scott Irwin, an agricultural economist at University of Illinois, suggested in a Twitter thread before Labor Day weekend that USDA may have factored in regional politics, which often divide the farm sector, when determining payment rates — the idea being to spread money around geographically so as not to concentrate too much in a certain place. Most soybean growers in the Midwest, who are receiving the bulk of the direct assistance, also grow corn. Irwin cited USDA crop price forecasts between May and August, which showed that corn prices fell by 20 cents a bushel, while cotton increased by 10 cents a pound. Yet, corn will receive direct payments at a rate of a penny a bushel — or $96 million — while cotton will get four cents a pound — or $277 million. USDA has said politics did not factor into the timing of the trade assistance package, nor in the formulation of payment rates. Department economists have been tracking the market for months to identify fluctuations that were tied to the retaliatory tariffs imposed by China and other trading partners, and were not caused by other factors like weather and supply and demand. ** A message from Barilla Foundation: How do we use the potential of local and urban actors across the food value chain to transform practices towards sustainable food and nutrition systems?

Gary Cohn, then director of the National Economic Council, reportedly had a simple idea to stop the president: Remove the paper from Trump’s desk. Bob Woodward describes the episode in his upcoming book on Trump’s White House, “Fear,” according to a review by The Washington Post. “Why aren’t we getting this done? Do your job. It’s tap, tap, tap. You’re just tapping me along. I want to do this,” Trump reportedly said to then-White House staff secretary Rob Porter, who had drafted the order as Trump instructed. But, Woodward reports, Cohn stepped in, fearing the economic consequences of a withdrawal. “I can stop this,” he said, according to accounts of the incident. “I’ll just take the paper off his desk.” Cohn reportedly told an associate that he used the same move to keep Trump from withdrawing from the trade agreement with South Korea, and the president didn’t notice it was missing, the Post writes. Guess who’s back in town today? Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland is expected to be back in Washington today to resume talks aimed at resolving NAFTA issues between Canada and the U.S. Freeland and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer are scheduled to meet around 11 a.m. Speaking of NAFTA: USTR has yet to release text of the updated agreement, but Pro DataPoint’s Taylor Miller Thomas has a helpful list of tentative provisions in the renegotiated trade deal, plus the reaction from industry groups to those items.

ENVIROS TARGET FARM BILL PESTICIDE CHANGES: Green groups are wary of a House farm bill provision they say would preempt local governments from setting their own pesticide safety regulations — namely, ordinances blocking use of glyphosate, the active ingredient in Monsanto’s Roundup, in places like parks and schoolyards. A new analysis out today from the Environmental Working Group, based on data from the nonprofit Beyond Pesticides, highlights 58 local pesticide laws — from Anchorage, Alaska, to Wichita, Kan., and Sarasota, Fla. — that it says would be scuttled if the House language is included in a final farm bill. The provision in question would effectively bar local governments from going beyond the federal government in regulating pesticides. Where it stands: Senate farm bill writers didn’t include similar language in their measure, S. 3042 (115), raising doubts that the controversial provision could end up in a farm bill conference agreement with any shot at becoming law. ROW CROPS: — Trump, GOP leaders to meet today: Speaker Paul Ryan, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn will join Trump at the White House this afternoon.

101,China’s Taste for Soybeans Is a Weak Spot in Trade War With Trump,Beijing’s retaliatory tariffs make American soy pricier. But the country’s huge demand for oil and animal feed makes it tough to stop importing overnight.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/09/business/china-trade-war-soybeans.html,2018-07-09T15:48:29Z,"Around Heihe, some growers are trying to modernize in other ways. Hou Wenlin started the Linfeng Modern Agricultural Specialty Cooperative in 2014. He does not believe that China will be able to replace soy imports entirely. “There’s no point,” Mr. Hou said. “It just can’t be done.” He does, however, believe that China can grow soybeans more scientifically. In one of his cooperative’s fields, the soy grows in neat rows that are spaced farther apart to keep the plants at the right temperature and moisture. Each season, he plants a number of different types of seeds to understand how each performs. He has two drones for spraying pesticide. Modern farming is expensive, however. And in Mr. Hou’s case, it involves a secret weapon: American technology. In front of the cooperative’s office is a yard full of bright-green John Deere farm machines, which Mr. Hou buys with the help of government subsidies. Chinese machinery is cheaper but more prone to breakdowns, he says. Even some of the fertilizer Mr. Hou uses comes from the United States. The Chinese equivalents are better now than they used to be. Earlier, though, there was something that was commonly said, according to Mr. Hou, among farmers around here who knew the chemical name of one of the most widely used plant foods: “We rely first on the heavens,” the saying went. “We rely second on American diammonium phosphate.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Secret Service released a set of heavily redacted visitor logs Wednesday as part of a legal settlement between the Trump administration and watchdog group Public Citizen, which had sued under the Freedom of Information Act to obtain records of four agencies housed inside the White House compound: the offices of Management and Budget, Science and Technology Policy and National Drug Control Policy, and the Council on Environmental Quality. Story Continued Below — The logs track visitors for the month of February, which included conservative think-tank types Myron Ebell and Marlo Lewis of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, David Kreutzer of the Heritage Foundation and Jim Tozzi of the Center for Regulatory Effectiveness.

Public Citizen’s own Robert Weissman and Amit Narang paid a visit to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, but Weissman was mum on the meeting’s details. “We didn’t weigh in on any specific rules,” he said. The full guest lists can be found here, and a new batch will be added every 30 days. Who’d we miss? Good afternoon, and welcome to PI.

WHAT’S NEXT NOW THAT THE FACEBOOK HEARINGS ARE OVER?: Now that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is out of the hot seat, what’s next? Elizabeth Gore, chairwoman of Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck ’s government relations department, said that whether the hearing will have broader implications has yet to be determined. But she predicted that one area where we could see some movement is in the privacy space. “I think the goal for [Zuckerberg] is to embrace some modest changes to fend off some more far-reaching reforms,” Gore said. “My guess is there is going to be some effort by Facebook in particular to embrace some regulatory changes on privacy issues.” She said the hearing “probably went as well for Facebook as it could have given the circumstances.” David Peluso, principal at Kountoupes Denham Carr &amp; Reid, said Zuckerberg’s hearing is “the beginning of Congress looking at these issue, not the end.” He predicted that we’ll likely see more tech companies reach out to lawmakers to let them know what they’re doing to build trust with their users and noted that “not all tech companies are the same.” TRADE GROUPS PROTEST CHINA TARIFFS: The National Retail Federation and the Information Technology Industry Council, along with 105 trade associations, sent a letter to House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) and ranking member Richard Neal (D-Mass.) warning of the effects of retaliatory tariffs on China, ahead of today’s hearing. “While the Administration has signaled that the proposed tariffs are intended to inflict maximum pain on China and minimal pain on the U.S. consumer, unfortunately that is not the case,” the letter said. “If imposed, these tariffs will result in higher prices for American consumers and fewer jobs for American workers.” In the letter, the trade groups “encourage Congress to work together and with the Administration to develop and execute a strategic policy to effectively address the longstanding problems in China.” Read the letter here. SPEAKING OF TARIFFS: A new coalition is forming to protest the Trump administration’s 25 percent tariff on steel imports. The Coalition of American Metal Manufacturers and Users will launch officially Wednesday at an event at the National Press Club. The event will feature Richard Chriss, president of the American Institute for International Steel; John Martin, president of Martin Associates; Laura Baughman, president of The Trade Partnership; Troy Roberts, CEO of Qualtek Manufacturing; and other manufacturers. The coalition also has a new website. AHEAD OF THE FILINGS: J.A. GREEN SIGNS SEVEN: J.A. Green &amp; Company has seven new clients: Colt’s Manufacturing Company LLC to lobby on “issues related to direct commercial sales of certain small-arms”; GN Hearing to lobby on “procurement of advanced hearing protection”; Global Tungsten &amp; Powders to lobby on “issues related to government acquisition of tungsten”; Mark Barnes &amp; Associates on behalf of Dillon Aero to lobby on “issues related to direct commercial sales of small-arms”; NovoCarbon Inc. to lobby on “sourcing and manufacture of battery-grade graphite”; US Ordnance to lobby on “issues related to direct commercial sales”; and Millennium Corporation to lobby on “support for penetration testing.” AKIN GUMP SIGNS NONPROFIT TO LOBBY ON OPIOID LEGISLATION: Akin Gump has signed Shatterproof, a nonprofit, to lobby on legislation to address opioid addiction crisis. In an interview with PI, Gary Mendell, the founder of Shatterproof, said the nonprofit is focused “on supporting many of the bills that have already been introduced in both the House and the Senate” and is also focused “on amending some of those bills to have greater impact on the amount of lives that would be saved.” Among the legislation Shatterproof is pushing is a bill that would require that federal funding that’s granted to states for treatment be used on programs that are based on proven research. Mendell said the group is also pushing for a bill that would provide grants to states to incentivize them to move toward electronic health records for addiction treatment programs. Mendell said that in 2009, “this was done for the entire health care system” except for programs related to either mental health or addiction. “Talk about a social injustice,” he said. SENATE SET TO CONFIRM FORMER COAL LOBBYIST FOR NO. 2 SLOT AT EPA: “The Senate on Thursday is widely expected to confirm the Environmental Protection Agency’s second-in-command, Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist who not only shares the deregulatory zeal of Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A. chief, but also his doubtful view of climate science,” The New York Times’ Coral Davenport reports. “Mr. Wheeler is viewed as a low-key insider with years of Washington experience in the art of pursuing policy change while avoiding public distraction. Deregulation is among President Trump’s central campaign promises, and Mr. Pruitt has proposed ambitious rollbacks of rules governing clean air and water and fighting against climate change. But many of his initiatives have stumbled because of haste or imprecision, and at least six have been struck down by the courts. That makes the arrival of Mr. Wheeler’s expertise particularly consequential.” — “Most recently, he lobbied for Murray Energy, whose chief executive, Robert E. Murray, has been a supporter and adviser of Mr. Trump’s.... A few weeks after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, Mr. Murray, who contributed $300,000 to Mr. Trump’s inauguration fund, presented the president with a wish list of regulations that he wanted to see lifted from the coal industry. Mr. Trump then assigned Mr. Pruitt to roll back those rules.” Full story. CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE TO CONGRESS: PROTECT DREAMERS: “A coalition of 51 state and local chambers of commerce today sent a letter to congressional leaders calling on them to pass a bipartisan bill that protects DACA enrollees and bolsters border security,” POLITICO’s Ted Hesson reports. ""‘While federal court injunctions are keeping DACA on life support, the uncertainty around the program's future is preventing our immigrant youth from realizing their potential — as future doctors, teachers, engineers, or entrepreneurs — to everyone's detriment,’ said the letter, organized by the pro-immigration New American Economy. The Senate debated immigration legislation in February, but several bipartisan proposals failed to advance. The groups urged Congress to deal with DACA immediately, adding that such legislation ‘will also lay the groundwork for the type of broader, common-sense reforms to our immigration system that we need to compete globally.’” Full story.

103,"'Budtenders,' edibles chefs among fastest-growing jobs in legal marijuana industry","Help wanted: budtenders, cannabis chefs, flavor scientists, extraction technicians.",https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2018/08/15/pot-industry-budtenders-edibles-chefs-among-fastest-growing-jobs/996888002/,2018-08-15T15:29:59Z,"Help wanted: budtenders, cannabis chefs, flavor scientists, extraction technicians. Those are just a few of the new job categories opening up in the budding legal cannabis industry in more than two dozen states where the drug is legal for medical or recreational use or both. A quick scan of online help-wanted ads shows cannabis companies are seeking a slew of new employees with all skill types, ranging from office managers to accountants to CEOs. But many of the positions posted on job sites such as Indeed.com and Vangsters.com – billed as the cannabis industry's largest hiring platform – require cannabis-specific skill sets. Those jobs include ""budtenders,'' the industry term for salespeople who, like bartenders, greet customers from across the counter at retail dispensaries. More: Can minority women succeed in the cannabis industry? More: Marijuana industry poised for supercharged growth thanks to President Trump More: Meet the weed workforce: Marijuana jobs set to triple in next decade In Ohio, for example, 56 licensed dispensaries are looking to hire budtenders to help medical cannabis patients select the best strains to treat each of 21 conditions that qualify for cannabis therapy in the state. Otherwise known as patient care representatives, budtenders must be able to articulate the characteristics and properties of each strain of cannabis they sell. While familiarity with the product is essential, stoners need not apply, according to Tom Adams, principal analyst at BDS Analytics, which tracks the cannabis industry. ""In Ohio, you're basically talking about providing medical services,'' Adams said. ""Even at the budtender level, cannabis companies are looking for smart people who can learn a lot in a hurry about cannabis' uses as medicine and can effectively communicate that to their customers.'' Compensation? Budtenders start at about $12 to $15 an hour, depending on location and experience. But the job is typically the first step toward becoming dispensary store managers who can earn salaries starting at about $40,000 a year. Budtender pay is comparable to most entry-level employees, including bud trimmers, who manicure cannabis plants by hand to remove excess foliage, and greenhouse workers who maintain the planting area. At the higher end of the pay scale, the most lucrative cannabis jobs pay up to $100,000 a year or more, according to a list of the highest-paying jobs in the cannabis industry posted by the online industry magazine Civilized. Unlike entry-level positions that typically require no formal education or training, the six-figure gigs are typically reserved for those with science and technology degrees. For example, master extractors who take cannabis plants and turn them into oils and other concentrates allowed for consumption in Ohio and other states are often required to have advanced degrees in biochemistry and engineering. Perhaps the most sought-after professionals in the legal cannabis industry are head growers who have the experience and training to mass produce cannabis on a commercial scale. More: California marijuana industry is a '$25 billion opportunity' More: Marijuana money increasingly flowing to Republican lawmakers The best grow masters have degrees in horticulture, plant health, or closely related fields, plus years of experience working in the industry. Not only do they earn well over $100,000 a year, on average, they commonly share a percentage of the cultivator's profits. The green rush for cannabis dollars has also created high-paying jobs for professionals with more creative or artistic dispositions. Chefs, for example, have secured a strong foothold in the medical cannabis industry by making the medicine easier to swallow. Cannabis chefs infuse edibles such as cakes and candies – even savory dishes like wing sauces and dips – with specific doses of cannabis oils and concentrates that comply with state laws. They also use their culinary skills to mask the sharp taste of THC – the main mind-altering ingredient in cannabis that gave old-school pot brownies an earthy taste. The market for cannabis chefs has exploded in recent years, with salaries for both topping out well above six-figures. As with most cannabis jobs, however, qualified candidates are hard to find, said Jacob Wagner, dean of student services at the Cleveland School of Cannabis. ""There’s a real lack of skilled labor in the cannabis industry, particularly in emerging markets like Ohio, where people haven't had a chance to work in the industry before,'' Wagner said. ""It's imperative that people go out and get the proper training from us or some other professional program if they want to land a good job in this business.'' The school, which launched in January 2017 in suburban Cleveland, offers a variety of cannabis certificate programs that have been approved by the Ohio Board of Career Colleges and Schools. Prices range from about $6,500 for a single major to $12,500 for the ""executive package,'' which includes a business component and instruction on how to start your own cannabis business. BDS estimates the medical cannabis industry in Ohio will generate close to $300 million in annual sales by 2022, and directly employ more than 6,000 workers. That doesn't include indirect employment by security firms, transportation companies and others supporting the legal cannabis industry. Nationwide, the cannabis industry is expected to create more than 400,000 jobs by 2021 and generate $40 billion in annual sales, according to BDS. But employment in Ohio will be tame compared to states that have legalized marijuana for both medical and recreational use. For example, Colorado, which was the first state to legalize cannabis for recreational use in 2012, has more than 20,000 workers in the cannabis industry. They support a medical and recreational cannabis market in which sales totaled more than $742 million in just the first six months of this year, with recreational sales accounting for more than two-thirds of the total, according to state's department of revenue. ""You won't see employment (in Ohio) at the level that it is in California or Colorado because the medical side of the market is a lot smaller than recreational,'' Adams said. ""But there's still a lot of opportunity in Ohio because you're talking about establishing a whole new industry.'' 1. The skills and degrees needed to land cannabis jobs vary. Some require cannabis training and experience working in the industry. Others simply require traditional job skills like accounting and office management. 2. Most jobs are off-limits to people who have drug felonies on their criminal records. 3. Federal labor laws don't apply to most cannabis enterprises, so employers aren't required to offer health insurance and benefits unless the state mandates it. 4. Many workers come into direct contact with cannabis plants, which may be a liability if you're subject to drug testing on another job. 5. You might think you're shoe-in for a job because of your years of experience growing or selling cannabis on the black market. But job candidates that tout that background could hurt their chances of landing a job in the legal industry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
104,Gottlieb doubles down on nutrition at FDA,Perdue won’t regulate gene-edited plants — Conaway rejects Democrats’ SNAP criticism — Soybean farmers brace for tariffs fallout,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-agriculture/2018/03/29/gottlieb-doubles-down-on-nutrition-at-fda-153550,2018-03-29T14:00:06Z,"With Helena Bottemiller Evich, Catherine Boudreau, Liz Crampton, Adam Behsudi and Maya Parthasarathy GOTTLIEB DOUBLES DOWN ON NUTRITION AT FDA: FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is speaking at the National Food Policy Conference in Washington this morning, and he is not letting up on nutrition goals. Story Continued Below The commissioner will deliver an unusually sweeping speech on how the FDA plans to better promote healthier eating. His comments are expected to include new specifics on how the agency is approaching everything from sodium reduction to what is considered “healthy.” POLITICO first reported FDA was working on a new suite of nutrition policies in November. “I think the most important thing that we can do is get back to public health basics: Reduce smoking rates, promote healthy diets, promote vaccination rates,” he said in a Wednesday interview on CNBC, hinting that nutrition would get more attention. “If we can actually make significant progress in those three things, the public health gains would dwarf any single invention that we could come up with. So we've said what we're going to do on tobacco. I think we're going to start talking a lot more about nutrition starting tomorrow.” FDA breaks the mold: The fact that FDA appears likely to keep on truckin’ on most of the Obama administration's nutrition agenda has upset some food companies. It has also drawn a spotlight on Gottlieb, who seems determined to not let food issues take a total backseat to drug policy. During the CNBC interview, the commissioner was asked how much feedback he gets from President Donald Trump on his work. “I have conversations from time to time. I'm not going to detail them here,” he said. “But, you know, I will say, you know, they've been very productive, and he's very well-informed about what we're doing and takes an interest in it.” Stay tuned for more from Pro Ag this morning.

Learn more at FairSugarPolicy.org. ** GREEN LIGHT ON GENE-EDITED FOOD: USDA announced on Wednesday that it would continue its practice of not regulating plants produced through genome editing. The move clarifies an existing policy sure to please agritech companies, Pro Ag’s Liz Crampton reports. More delicious food?: Gene editing is an emerging technology plant breeders use to introduce traits to protect crops against disease and drought. It has even been used to making food tastier and eliminate allergens. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said the department would not be “stepping away” from its regulatory responsibilities but that the clarification would allow farmers to use this science to produce healthy, affordable food. The rules governing biotech crops, known as the part 340 regulations, stem from the Plant Pest Act. The 1957 law is aimed at preventing bugs, weeds and other unwanted pests from getting into the U.S. agricultural supply. But developers have complained about the regulatory process that generally lasts for years. It takes 11 years on average and about $136 million to get government sign-off for a genetically engineered plant, according to a 2011 CropLife International study. That has made the process prohibitively expensive for all but the biggest players in the biotech market. CONAWAY REJECTS DEMS’ SNAP JUDGMENT: House Agriculture Chairman Mike Conaway said Democrats have not accurately portrayed his proposal to overhaul the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. In an interview with American Ag Network, he dismissed their criticism. “Once the American people see this, and once my Democratic colleagues see exactly what we’re doing as opposed to what they’ve been told we’re doing — which from what I can tell is not exactly accurate — I think they’ll see the value of it and join us,” Conaway said of his proposal to tighten work requirements and eligibility in SNAP. The sticking points: Minority committee staff members briefed reporters on Tuesday on aspects of the nutrition title that they consider unacceptable and that ultimately led to the breakdown in negotiations between ranking member Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) and Conaway two weeks ago. Those proposals include eliminating broad-based categorical eligibility (but maintaining traditional and narrow eligibility); severing the connection between SNAP and a program known as LIHEAP that subsidizes low-income households' utility expenses; and imposing stricter work requirements on about three million to five million people. Democrats also oppose what would be a mandatory employment and training program at the state level. An estimated one million people would be pushed off SNAP and benefits would be slashed by more than $20 billion over a decade under Conaway’s plan, Democrats said. Squishy numbers: Conaway said he didn’t know where the $20 billion figure came from, but that no one would be kicked off SNAP. The one million people would leave the program in one of two ways: they get a job that pays more than 130 percent of the poverty level, or they decide not to work at least 20 hours a week or enroll in a training program. “This is an opportunity to reinvest monies back into job training,” Conaway said. “There are guaranteed slots if you’re 18 to retirement age. Each state would have to provide you a training slot that would involve apprenticeships, training and subsidized employment."" SOYBEAN FARMERS BRACE FOR CHINA IMPACT: Iowa’s soybean growers were in the middle of a trade mission to China last week when President Donald Trump announced his decision to hit Beijing with tariffs and investment restrictions. In meetings with buyers ranging from state-owned food processing giant COFCO to animal feed companies, there was already a sense “that things could get worse before they get better,” Kirk Leeds, CEO of the Iowa Soybeans Association, said in an interview. “They wanted to believe that for the self-interest of China and feeding Chinese consumers that the Chinese government would not bring soybeans into it,” said Leeds, who was on the eight-day trip with Iowa farmers who visited four cities between Beijing and Shenzhen. Retaliation on their minds: Leeds also said there was “no doubt” that the Chinese government was looking to retaliate against U.S. soybeans — the top U.S. ag export to China — totaling $14 billion in 2017. “They’re well aware if you look at the leading producers of soybeans by political regions of the U.S. that President Trump gained a lot of votes out of the states that happen to produce a lot of soybeans,” he said. U.S. envoy and former Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad told the group he was aware of the how much a trade spat would hurt U.S. farmers, Leeds said. Sourcing questions: Leeds said Chinese buyers would be challenged, at least in the short term, to get the country’s entire domestic demand from Brazil and Argentina, the other two markets that come close to competing with U.S. production. “Longer term — with some additional acreage in Brazil — there’s a lot of acres that could be brought into production, there might be some less concern about getting enough soybeans sourced from South America,” Leeds said, adding that China’s government policy has always been to try to diversify where it sources soybeans. “They clearly set out to make sure that they weren’t totally dependent on the United States, and I would suggest that they don’t want to be totally dependent on South America either,” he said.

105,Why California won't necessarily grow (all) America's marijuana,"California is a U.S. leader in many crops, but some constraints that may prevent it from dominating the marijuana market across the U.S., at least for awhile.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/why-california-won-t-necessarily-grow-america-s-marijuana-n834466,2018-01-09T23:29:32Z,"SALINAS, Calif. — This state has long been dubbed America’s salad bowl, because of the ability of the state’s industrial-scale farms to produce food in mass quantities. Beginning this year, it will also begin widespread legal production of a very different crop. The grower of more than one-third of the nation’s vegetables and two-thirds of its fruits and nuts is expected to begin providing an outsize share of its marijuana, after the drug became legal for recreational use on Jan. 1. But it's still not clear who will produce all that pot: small growers, who have been cultivating it for years; big agribusiness, with the resources for mass production; or the black market, which will probably ignore the state's expensive new growing rules. That uncertainty is because marijuana remains illegal under federal law and will be highly taxed and expensive to produce under California law. That could slow the state from taking a leading production role nationally, at least for legal cannabis, in the near term. California is already an outsize contributor of black-market marijuana for the rest of the country, with more than four-fifths of the 13.5 million pounds grown in the state last year ending up in other markets, according to the state Department of Food and Agriculture. Much of that marijuana has come from the Emerald Triangle, in the verdant northern reaches of the state. Estimates suggest the state has produced as much as 80 percent of the nation's illicit marijuana. Steve DeAngelo, the executive director of Harborside in Oakland, one of the state’s biggest cannabis dispensaries, and also a partner in a marijuana cultivation venture, hopes that the state can take nearly as dominant a position as legal use spreads across the country. “I see it as California’s natural legacy, its destiny,"" he said, ""to supply 50 percent of the legal U.S. cannabis market."" Players who hope to strike it big in the state’s newly legalized environment — under a ballot measure approved by voters in November 2016 — are setting up farms throughout California, from former flower hothouses in the Salinas Valley, to Silicon Valley warehouses, to farms in the high desert community of California City. The principals include people like DeAngelo, the pot evangelist who sold his first joint at age 15; the son of reggae icon Bob Marley; former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson; and Jeff Brothers, a one-time Republican Party leader who plans to have military veterans tend his greenhouses. Steve DeAngelo makes the first legal recreational marijuana sale to Henry Wykowski at Harborside. Elijah Nouvelage / Reuters Brothers, who ran cut-flower farms in Salinas for decades, said California’s climate, labor pool and deep experience in agriculture make it a natural to become a national leader in legal marijuana production. “When we no longer have a moratorium on delivering cannabis across state lines, California will end up in the position where it ends up in virtually every other agricultural commodity, which is in a very strong position or at the top,” said Brothers. “I like to say these operations will become like a Mondavi or Gallo of the industry.” The ban on interstate shipments of marijuana remains in place, because the federal government still deems the substance an illegal “Schedule One” drug. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has long resisted petitions to change that status, which groups marijuana alongside drugs like LSD, peyote and heroin. All are deemed to have “no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.” The divide between the states and federal government became more pronounced last week, when Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that he would give federal prosecutors the power to prosecute marijuana crimes. It was not immediately clear whether U.S. attorneys would act on that power, but it was a marked contrast from an Obama administration policy that shielded legalized marijuana from federal intervention. Sol Orchard President &amp;amp; CEO Jeff Brothers surveys old cut flower green houses on a property along Spence Road in Salinas that he will be converting for marijuana farming. Peter DaSilva / for NBC News That hard line against pot also flies in the face of public opinion and the law in 29 states, which allow marijuana to be used for medical purposes. Eight states, including California, now also allow pot to be used for recreational purposes. Some states that have legalized recreational cannabis use, like Colorado, have seen legal cultivation skyrocket, said Tom Adams of BDS Analytics, an industry analyst based in Boulder, Colorado. Grow houses have mushroomed around the Rocky Mountain state and driven out most black-market competitors, with only about 20 percent of sales now going to illicit operators, Adams said. This may be partly because legal pot is price-competitive with the illegal product, since Colorado has kept taxes relatively low, with a 15-percent excise tax and sales taxes that average 6 percent, depending on locality. The state of Washington, in contrast, levies a 37 percent excise tax on legal marijuana sales, in addition to sales taxes that average nearly 9 percent. That is keeping as many as half of Washington's cannabis buyers on the black market, where taxes are not levied, according to BDS Analytics. Advocates of legal marijuana fear that high taxes in California — with state and local levies reaching 30 percent and higher — could also leave a sizable portion of the nation's biggest market to illicit dealers. A worker holds a 30 day-old cannabis plant. Peter DaSilva / for NBC News The strict regulatory framework in California is estimated to add $560 a pound to the cost of wholesale pot. That may be sustainable if indoor-cultivated pot prices remain above $2,000 a pound wholesale. But growers worry that a glut from new cultivation will push the price sharply downward. “Right now is the biggest time ever for cowboy production,” said Bernard Steimann, CEO of People’s dispensary in Orange County, and also a partner in grow houses in the Salinas Valley, who fears competition from unlicensed competitors. Growers say they face several other hurdles that make the push into mass marijuana cultivation something less than a gold rush. One challenge is high costs. Contractors for everything from fencing to septic tank servicing also see an opportunity in marijuana and are charging more. “For anything you want, there are two different prices — one for the cannabis grower and one for the noncannabis grower,” said Sergio Silva, a 35-year veteran of farming in Salinas, who has partnered with Steimann to grow marijuana. Another challenge is building infrastructure. To grow at the maximum rate — turning five harvests in a year — farmers need extra light. But several Salinas-area growers said their utility company, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, has said they will have to wait a year, maybe two, for the capacity they need to fully light their grow houses. (The utility said the work takes up to six months.) Old cut flower facilities along Spence Road in Salinas will soon be converted to grow marijuana. Peter DaSilva / for NBC News The state was contemplating another brake on mega-growers: a one-acre limit on farms for the first five years after legalization. Such limits are designed to prevent agribusiness from overwhelming the long-time growers — many in the north end of the state — who had established the industry during its many decades on the margins. But when interim regulations were issued in November, the one-acre limit was not included. Hezekiah Allen, executive director of the California Growers Association, who represents long-time pot farmers, said the failure to limit the size of farms “rolled out the red carpet to big multinational conglomerates” to take over the pot industry. DeAngelo, of Oakland’s Harborside dispensary, said that there will always be room for smaller operators but that some California farms need to go big to compete with other states and to make prices low enough for everyone to enjoy the benefits of pot. “That is what we do really well in California,” he said. “Produce good, high-quality crops in mass and at a low cost.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
106,Sime Darby's Africa ambitions stall pending new deforestation rules,"When Malaysia's biggest plantation company Sime Darby leased 220,000 hectares of lush forest in northwest Liberia in 2009, executives said they had found a much needed new frontier in global palm oil development.",https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKCN1FY193-OZATP,2018-02-14T10:27:49Z,"GBAH, Liberia/KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - When Malaysia’s biggest plantation company Sime Darby leased 220,000 hectares of lush forest in northwest Liberia in 2009, executives said they had found a much needed new frontier in global palm oil development. Undulating hills, a tropical climate and plenty of untouched land made the West African country’s interior ideal for palm oil growers running out of room in Southeast Asia. Nine years later, however, Sime Darby Plantation has planted only 10,000 hectares in Liberia and has not laid a seed in two years, stalled by uncertainties over new environmental standards. “We are losing money. We have to balance our books or there is no future,” said David Parker, the head of Sime Darby Plantations in Liberia. In its earnings report for the financial year ending in June 2017, Sime Darby said it had filed a 202 million ringgit ($51.3 million) impairment - a permanent reduction in the value of the asset - on its Liberia operations. The operations were “affected by a number of factors, including the Ebola outbreak and more stringent environmental plans that have stalled expansion since 2014”, it said. The $62 billion palm oil industry is considering whether to adopt new “no deforestation” rules for an oil found on supermarket shelves across the world, from cooking oil to snack food and soups to soaps. The rules mark a more environmentally friendly form of palm oil development, but leave producers with a major conundrum: how to meet growing demand and make money with so much land now potentially off limits. PLANTING PAUSE The debate is unfolding at the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), an industry watchdog that consists of planters, companies and NGOs. While awaiting those rules, Sime Darby has stopped planting palm in Liberia, Parker said. Singapore-listed Olam International in Gabon has also paused development on all but grassland areas until the rules are published, said Ranveer Chauhan, its managing director of edible oils. But back at corporate headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, Sime says it is trying out a new method using satellite data to measure a forest’s carbon content so it can tell exactly how much land it can and cannot develop. “A new plan for land development in Liberia is currently being prepared following the completion of these trials,” Sime’s chief sustainability officer Simon Lord told Reuters. Darrel Webber, chief executive officer at the RSPO secretariat in Malaysia, said he cannot comment with the review under way “and no conclusive decisions on the changes have been made yet”. The rules are expected to come to a vote at RSPO’s annual meeting in November. Concerns about the amount of forests and peatlands cleared for plantations - and the greenhouse gases that are then emitted into the atmosphere - have plagued the palm oil industry for years. Over the past decade, consumer activist groups have pressed big palm oil buyers such as Pepsico, Unilever and Nestle with supermarket boycotts and other protests over palm oil’s perceived links to climate change. Many companies are willing to pay a premium price for palm oil labelled with a valued RSPO sustainability certificate. The new rules will decide if land can be cleared for palm based on its carbon content. A dense forest might hold up to 150 tonnes of carbon per hectare, grassland about 35 tonnes. If the RSPO decides an area holding above 100 tonnes an hectare is off limits, then Sime Darby may be unable to develop most of its Liberia concession, said Ahmad Rifqi, Sime Darby’s manager of plantation sustainability in Liberia. “Almost all here is over 100 tonnes per hectare. The only low-carbon areas are farmlands already cultivated by local communities,” he said. FEW ‘GREENFIELD’ EXPANSIONS Sime Darby boasts of being the world’s biggest producer of sustainable palm oil. It has an online “dashboard” displaying information about its supply chain and compliance with RSPO rules. It’s land bank of nearly 990,000 hectares, an area larger than Puerto Rico, makes it the world’s largest palm plantation firm by land size. The Liberia concessions account for over a fifth of that. With governments and companies under increasing pressure to adhere to higher deforestation standards, “greenfield” expansions in Southeast Asia have become uncommon, says Ivy Ng, regional head of plantations research at CIMB Investment Bank in Kuala Lumpur. “In recent years, company expansion is largely via buying stakes of other companies,” Ng said. Sime Darby’s only major expansion in Southeast Asia since its 2007 merger with two other large plantation firms has been its acquisition of New Britain Palm Oil in Papua New Guinea in 2015. Oil palm originated in West Africa and was used there for thousands of years. And with global demand growing by an average 5 percent a year, growers had looked to Africa to expand. Yet production in Africa has grown by less than 4 percent since 2012, compared to around 18.5 percent for Southeast Asia and globally. Latin America is now the number two producing region. CASCADE OF TROUBLES From a watchtower on Sime Darby’s Liberian plantation, low lines of palm can be seen trailing to the horizon, a duller green than the natural forest canopy that towers above the concession’s edge. The serene view belies a cascade of troubles. Local residents, who claimed Sime had encroached on community ands, set up roadblocks to halt workers and stole keys from bulldozers, community leaders and workers told Reuters. Sime says the land came from a government concession. But to appease residents, it built schools and offers free medical services to workers and their families. Its own ambitions, meanwhile, have shrunk. A new mill that doesn’t have enough fruit to press into oil to run at full capacity and crop theft by local residents costs the company about 20 percent of its harvest in some areas, Parker said. Sime hopes to plant another 10,000 hectares once it can show the first 10,000 are profitable, Parker said. “Sime Darby is committed to the long term - if we can make a profit on the first 10,000 hectares.” Reporting By Edward McAllister in GBAH, Liberia and Emily Chow in Kuala Lumpur",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
107,Avocado 'green gold' ripe and ready for South Africa's farmers,"Whether you like to squash it onto your toast in the morning, millennial-style, eat it to cut your cholesterol with healthy unsaturated oil, or moisturise your face with it - if you live in the West, you're probably rarely far from an avocado.",https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1JG2BK-OZATP,2018-06-20T15:30:57Z,"NELSPRUIT, South Africa (Reuters) - Whether you like to squash it onto your toast in the morning, millennial-style, eat it to cut your cholesterol with healthy unsaturated oil, or moisturise your face with it - if you live in the West, you’re probably rarely far from an avocado. And that is very good news for South Africa’s farmers, struggling with drought, who are switching to a crop whose farm-gate price has risen 130 percent since 2008. Already, South Africa generates around 1.85 billion rand ($137 million) a year from avocados, producing around 125,000 tonnes and exporting more than half to Europe. In 2008, they fetched an average 9.64 rand (70 U.S. cents) per kg, in 2017 it was 22.10 rand. It takes six years to get an avocado plantation into production, but that is not putting farmers off. “Forestry plantations are being felled and cleared and avocados planted,” said Derek Donkin, chief executive of the South African Subtropical Growers’ Association. “There are also areas that were either bush or some grazing that’s been planted to avocados.” There are currently about 16,500 hectares (41,800 acres) of avocado plantations, and that area is growing by about 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres) a year. Traditionally, avocados were grown in humid sub-tropical climates in the Limpopo, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal provinces, but now they are being planted in the drier Eastern and Western Cape provinces. Techniques such as drip irrigation, which drips water slowly on the soil, and planting orchids on ridges to reduce surface run-off help to make the most of the water available. “Traditionally, no one would ever dream about planting down there, but you need to pioneer - much like this farm was pioneered more than 100 years ago,” said Craig Lewis, an executive at the producer HL Hall and Sons on a farm near the northern city of Nelspruit. The firm hopes that its trial plantation on the Western Cape - hit hard by drought this year - might allow it to extend what is now a six-month season to 10 months, to supply a global year-round demand. “Although South Africa is planting 1,000 hectares a year, we would like to plant a lot more,” Lewis said. Donkin said the rate could hit as much as 2,000 hectares a year within the next few years. On a smaller scale, Tom Mdluli manages 188 employees on a 6,000 hectare community farm in Mpumalanga province owned by a Trust. It exports around 80 percent of its 260 hectares’ worth of avocados - and is planning to expand by another 120 hectares. Even the wines famously grown on the Cape may one day have to move aside for the avocado. “They swap the annual crops like maize, cotton and alfalfa for more permanent crops,” said Wessel Lemmer, senior agricultural economist at Absa Bank. “They even take out vines.” ($1 = 13.4745 rand) Additional reporting by Nomvelo Chalumbira; Editing by James Macharia and Kevin Liffey",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
108,I Bought a Fiddle-leaf Fig From the New Amazon Plants Store,“It was just about as seamless a transaction as I could’ve hoped for — as easy and hassle-free as buying a toothbrush.”,http://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-plants-amazon.html,2018-05-01T17:04:20Z,"As you may have heard, Amazon sells plants now. Actually, it’s sold plants for a while, but the retailer’s recently centralized its offerings to form the Amazon Plants Store. The eight featured brands you’ll find on that page aren’t the only plant sellers on Amazon, but you can think of them as the most vetted options, the quality and prices comparable to what you’d find at the Home Depot (which makes sense because at least two of the featured brands list both Amazon and the Home Depot as retail partners). I buy a lot of things through Amazon, and like a true apartment-dwelling millennial, I appreciate a good houseplant. It’s well-known by now that houseplants lift your mood and purify your air. But the idea of something as complex (in the multicellular sense) and delicate as a plant being processed through Amazon’s vast shipping network in a cardboard box makes me a little uncomfortable. Then again, like anyone who has ever spent 20 minutes in an Ikea parking lot wresting a four-foot-tall yucca cane into a car trunk, I can appreciate the convenience of having plants delivered to my door with free two-day shipping. I gave it a try and ordered the Amazon Plant Store’s top-rated houseplant — a plant so trendy that even The Wall Street Journal just declared it “over” — the fiddle-leaf fig. The product page says, “Usually ships in 5-7 days,” but mine shipped the day after I placed the order and arrived two days later. It all went smoothly, just like any Amazon Prime order, nothing to see here. It came in a large cardboard box, clearly marked “This End Up,” and indicated that a live plant was inside. It was well-packaged, wrapped securely in paper and held in place by indentations in the box, set in a plastic grower’s pot filled with soil. In short, it was just about as seamless a transaction as I could’ve hoped for — as easy and hassle-free as buying a toothbrush. I was pleasantly surprised, even if it’s easy to imagine how it could go wrong: an extreme shift in weather or a missed delivery window might be all that separated me from the guy who left a one-star review with a grainy cell-phone picture of a dead plant (growers warn you not to try to buy these if your area is experiencing extreme temperatures). I was so satisfied with my fiddle-leaf fig that it led me down a rabbit hole of researching other plants for my apartment. These are the ones I’m looking at. Costa Farms Premium Live Indoor Burgundy Rubber Plant This rubber tree will probably be my next purchase. One of my new favorite things to Google is, “ What is the next fiddle-leaf fig? ” — and not to blow up anyone’s spot, but I’m seeing the rubber tree pop up a lot. Don’t make the same mistake I did with the fiddle-leaf. Get in now before it’s too late. Shop Succulents 4” Aloe Vera Plant If you’re scared of killing your very first plant purchase, aloes are great, hearty plants for beginners. Color Orchids Phalaenopsis Orchid In Ceramic This white orchid comes in a decorative ceramic pot with a built-in wicking system to help the plant maintain optimal moisture levels (orchids can be notoriously finicky). It comes with a shot glass measured with the water you need to add once per week. Costa Farms Peace Lily Spathiphyllum Peace lilies are quite possibly the best air purifier of all houseplants (a NASA study found that it removed benzene and formaldehyde from the air). They’re easy to care for, too. Costa Farms Premium Live Indoor Snake Plant The snake plant is pretty much impossible to mess up. I have one (not purchased from here) that is about four-feet tall and thriving — it looks just fantastic, too. I water it when I think to, and the plant couldn’t care less. This one’s a top seller on Amazon, and its reviews make it look very popular. Blue Chiffon Rose of Sharon (Hibiscus) Live Shrub This blue hibiscus shrub is very popular, too, with lots of positive reviews about how well it was packed and the number of blooms. A good choice if you’re looking for a hardy plant and big bloomer. Note that it doesn’t arrive in that blue pot above, but in a standard grower’s pot. Green Giant Arborvitae Tree Warning: You should only buy this if you have a big backyard. A hearty evergreen, this “ Green Giant ” tree arrives at about two feet tall, but they grow fast, up to three feet a year for a maximum height of sixty feet.

109,Perdue: USDA will look into immigrants dropping from WIC,Pesticide makers see legal losses piling up — Action on trade war’s many fronts — What immigrant farmworkers are listening to,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-agriculture/2018/09/10/perdue-usda-will-look-into-immigrants-dropping-from-wic-334469,2018-09-10T14:00:01Z,"With help from Helena Bottemiller Evich, Sabrina Rodriguez and Maya Parthasarathy PERDUE: USDA WILL LOOK INTO IMMIGRANTS DROPPING FROM WIC: Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue expressed concern about reports that immigrants are dropping out of WIC due to fears that using the aid could mean being denied a green card in the future. He said USDA will look into the matter. Story Continued Below “I would be concerned about that, obviously. We’ll look into that further,” Perdue said during a wide-ranging interview on C-SPAN’s “Newsmakers” that took place on Friday and aired over the weekend. He was questioned by Pro Ag’s Helena Bottemiller Evich and Bloomberg’s Alan Bjerga. Signal boost: Perdue said he wasn’t aware of POLITICO’s recent report on the trend. But public health advocates have been alarmed over anecdotal evidence from at least 18 states showing a drop in participation after news reports that the White House is considering a new policy that could deny legal status to immigrants who have received a broad range of health, nutrition and education benefits, including WIC. USDA has long touted WIC as one of the most successful and cost-effective nutrition programs because it’s been shown to improve health outcomes for moms and infants. POLITICO’s story has since been followed by a mix of other outlets including New York Magazine, The Daily Beast and Breitbart. Perdue cites compassion: Perdue said he believes it’s crucial that the government strike the right balance in administering public assistance. Americans are “some of the most compassionate, generous people in the world,” he said, but taxpayers are also concerned about how funds are spent. “We do not want immigrants, particularly those who are coming undocumented or illegally into the country, to come in and take advantage of the programs that the taxpayers are providing there,” Perdue said. “But when it comes to women and children, I think we have to lean on the side of compassion.” Find more on Perdue’s response here. USDA to release bailout details: During the interview, Perdue also pledged to release the analysis USDA used to divvy up the initial $6.3 billion in trade aid for farmers. “We’ll do that as soon as possible,” he said. Pros can read more on that here. Producers ‘holding strong’ amid trade war: On the subject of trade pain, Perdue said he’s been “pleasantly surprised” by just how much farmers and ranchers are sticking by the Trump administration amid an onslaught of retaliatory tariffs aimed at agriculture. “I’ve been so surprised, and, I guess, pleasantly surprised, about how strong the support has been from the agriculture community.” Pros, that’s here. Perdue defends ERS, NIFA moves: The secretary said he disagreed with concerns that scientific integrity could be compromised by moving the Economic Research Service under the Office of the Chief Economist and relocating it outside of Washington, D.C. along with the National Institute of Food and Agriculture. “We’re going to do this as smoothly and gently as possible,” Perdue said, adding that he’s “sensitive” to the fact that ERS and NIFA staff have lives, homes and children settled in the D.C. area. Perdue said he believes the moves will get USDA a better workforce while saving money. Catch up with Secretary Sonny: The interview covered a broad range of additional topics, from trade to the farm bill and the recent New York Times op-ed penned by an anonymous Trump administration senior staffer. (Perdue, for the record, said he hasn’t heard any 25th Amendment chatter ). So pour yourself a cup of coffee and get caught up with @SecretarySonny. You can watch the interview here.

PESTICIDE MAKERS SEE LEGAL LOSSES PILING UP: Chemical companies have been on a losing streak in recent court cases over the use of their products on plants and farms, and environmentalists who consider the substances harmful to public health and the environment see this as a moment of reckoning for agribusinesses like DowDuPont and Bayer, which now controls Monsanto, Pro Ag’s Liz Crampton reports. “These recent decisions collectively show the justice system’s recognition of what the American public... and scientists have been aware of for some time: These pesticides are harmful to human health and the environment,” said George Kimbrell, legal director for the Center for Food Safety. A look at the recent cases: In August, a U.S. appellate court ordered EPA to ban the use of chlorpyrifos, a pesticide used on fruits, vegetables and nuts that has been linked to memory loss, attention deficit disorder and other neurological problems in children. Also last month, a California jury sided with a former groundskeeper who alleged that Monsanto’s Roundup weedkiller, which includes the herbicide glyphosate, gave him terminal cancer. More than 5,000 other people are suing the company, claiming Monsanto hid the potential cancer risk posed by its products. Dicamba, Monsanto’s other widely used and controversial weedkiller, is also the subject of multiple lawsuits, and EPA is expected to make a decision by November about reauthorizing it. Industry response: The makers of the pesticides say the new rulings will damage farmers’ ability to grow crops. DowDuPont’s new agriculture division, Corteva, said after last month’s ruling that “chlorpyrifos is a critical pest management tool” and that the company “will continue to support the growers who need this important product.” The conglomerate is the biggest manufacturer of chlorpyrifos. “Glyphosate transformed agriculture,” Scott Partridge, Monsanto’s vice president of global strategy, told Liz. “When you have plaintiffs lawyers trying to take that out of the hands of growers around the world, a product that’s a safe tool … I am offended.” ** A message from Barilla Foundation: World hunger is on the rise.

That escalated quickly: “The $200 billion we’re talking about could take place very soon,” Trump told reporters Friday aboard Air Force One. A public comment period for those tariffs ended last week, meaning the White House is now free to impose them at any point. “I hate to say that, but behind that, there’s another $267 billion ready to go on short notice if I want,” the president added. “That totally changes the equation.” If the administration follows through on all the tariffs Trump has now threatened, virtually all Chinese imports to the U.S. would be subject to duties. Beijing has already retaliated with its own tariffs, targeting U.S. agricultural producers in particular, and has another response at the ready if Trump pulls the trigger on the duties targeting $200 billion in Chinese goods. Pro Trade’s Megan Casella and Doug Palmer have more on the trade war with China. Better luck elsewhere? Beyond the tit-for-tat with China, trade talks with U.S. allies continue on several fronts this week. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer visits Brussels today to meet with European Union Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström to continue efforts to lay groundwork for talks about a potential transatlantic trade pact. It’s the first meeting of top officials since Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker struck a short-term truce in July to hold off on additional tariffs and establish a framework for working towards a broader deal. Ag alert: A push by the U.S. to include agriculture in any negotiation — the Europeans have said ag provisions won’t be in the mix — is one of the main sticking points. EU officials expect ag to make for a challenging meeting, our friends at POLITICO Europe tell us. At an EU trade attachés meeting on Friday, France demanded there should be no regulatory cooperation in the agricultural sector, which it fears could be used as a backdoor to open up ag markets via U.S.-EU trade talks. Paris also received backing from the Netherlands in urging the European Commission not to link the planned renegotiation of a hormone-free beef quota to the broader trade talks, one person at the meeting told our European colleagues. Then it’s back to NAFTA. Lighthizer’s one-day trip to Belgium serves as a quick break from negotiations to potentially add Canada to the new NAFTA framework the U.S. and Mexico hammered out. He’ll be back to Washington on Tuesday for a few days, leaving a window for the talks to continue before the G-20 trade ministers meeting in Argentina on Friday. There are no high-level NAFTA meetings scheduled at this point, but it’s also not clear whether Lighthizer will attend the G-20 confab or send someone in his place. The U.S.-Canada talks ended Friday without a breakthrough, as negotiators continue to be at odds over the dispute settlement process housed in Chapter 19 and the Trump administration’s demand that Canada open its dairy markets to U.S. exports, as Pro Trade’s Sabrina Rodriguez reported on Friday. Drawing a line: Perdue, during the C-SPAN interview, said Lighthizer has been “very clear” that Canada’s Class 7 dairy pricing system must be removed as part of any NAFTA deal. “I think it will be gone,” Perdue said. WHAT IMMIGRANT FARMWORKERS ARE LISTENING TO: Stop by any group of farmworkers in California’s Central Valley and you’re likely to notice a trend: they’re all tuned in to La Campesina. The Spanish-language radio network started in 1983 by Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers has become something like Radio Free Europe for the Hispanic immigrant community in Western states, Alondra De La Cruz writes for POLITICO Magazine in this dispatch from Arvin, Calif. La Campesina has nine stations from Yuma, Ariz., to Washington state, broadcasting in AM and FM to more than 1 million regular listeners. “While AM radio is often thought to be the turf of conservative talking heads, La Campesina’s KNAI is frequently the top-rated AM station in metropolitan Phoenix,” De La Cruz writes. “In April, it had double the ratings of KFYI, the local station that carries Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck, competing against those broadcasting titans with regional Mexican music, resistance-themed commentary en Español, and practical life tips for getting by as a Latino immigrant in Trump’s America.” One of La Campesina’s most popular segments provides advice for workers on what to do if they are approached by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. Farmworkers who’ve encountered ICE can call into the station to share their stories. The station reaches listeners across the border in Mexicali and San Luis Rio Colorado. It’s streamed online in places as far south as Mexico City, Guatemala and El Salvador. “There is no wall for us,” Maria Barquin, who directs programming for the entire La Campesina network, told De La Cruz. “The signal crosses the wall.” ROW CROPS: — Senate to take up opioids package: The Senate is set to vote this week on a bipartisan opioids response package that would authorize new funds for states to fight the opioid crisis and ease restrictions on telemedicine for substance use disorders, among other changes, Pro’s Brianna Ehley and Darius Tahir reported last week. USDA recently announced it was partnering with Isaiah House to enable the nonprofit to transform two USDA-owned homes in Kentucky into transitional housing for people recovering from opioid misuse. In October of last year, the CDC reported that drug overdose death rates in rural areas have surpassed those in urban areas. — Applying for trade aid: The Minneapolis-St. Paul Star Tribune reports on Minnesota farmers feeling the sting of retaliatory tariffs and turning to USDA for assistance. Next year is already looking grim for farmers in the state: 20 percent of Upper Midwest farmers won’t be able to get credit to finance spring planting, unless there’s a miracle turnaround in prices, Wayzata commodity broker Al Kluis told the newspaper. — Court rejects GMA’s record $18 million fine: A Washington appeals court late last week overturned a record-setting $18 million judgment against the Grocery Manufacturers Association. GMA was hit with the fine after failing to disclose the food and beverage companies that contributed to an anti-GMO labeling campaign in 2012, Capital Press reports. — Concentrated crops: Local crop production has become much less diverse in the U.S., thanks to the growth of global markets and industrial-scale agriculture, GMO use and the rise of ethanol and farm exports to China. Bloomberg explains the industry’s geographic consolidation. — New deadline for ERS, NIFA suitors: Universities and other localities that want to be the new home of USDA’s Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture now have until Oct. 15 to submit proposals to USDA. Perdue aims to move the agencies out of D.C. by late 2019. — House GOP divided on tax ‘2.0’ bill: House Republicans in tough reelection races — especially those in suburban districts and high-tax states — are pushing back against President Trump and House GOP leaders’ plan to vote on a second round of tax cuts later this month, preferring to leave the issue alone ahead of the midterm elections. POLITICO’s Nancy Cook and Pro Tax’s Bernie Becker explain the internal GOP debate. — A scorecard for animals: The nonprofit group Animal Wellness Action is out with a new tool tracking how members of Congress vote on animal rights issues. Among the bills AWA has scored : legislation on using aircraft to hunt bears, domestic violence protections for pets and banning the sale of shark fins. — Scott Walker on the ropes: Wisconsin Democrats think they have the two-term Republican governor cornered. Walker appears to be losing support among independents and suburban voters, he’s slightly down in the polls and some of his former aides have turned on him and cut ads for his opponent. POLITICO’s Natasha Korecki has more on Walker’s fight for political survival. THAT’S ALL FOR MA! See you again tomorrow.

110,Guest-worker bill a problem for McCarthy,Senate could soon push farm bill to conference — Senate Ag set to vet 2 nominees — Diving deeper on U.S.-Canada dairy trade,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-agriculture/2018/07/24/guest-worker-bill-a-problem-for-mccarthy-295243,2018-07-24T14:04:13Z,"With help from Catherine Boudreau and Helena Bottemiller Evich GUEST-WORKER BILL A PROBLEM FOR MCCARTHY: House GOP leaders are reversing on a promise to hold a vote before August recess on a conservative immigration bill that features a new guest-worker program for farmers, POLITICO’s Rachael Bade reports. The move puts House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy in an awkward spot as he seeks to become the next speaker. In June, he promised several rank-and-file members a vote, and the assurance was critical: It persuaded Reps. Dennis Ross (R-Fla.) and Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.) not to back an effort to force a vote on legislation that would have created a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers. That so-called discharge petition failed by just two votes. Story Continued Below But now, Republican leaders have no plans to take up the guest-worker program before the summer break, four sources in leadership told Rachael, because House Speaker Paul Ryan doesn’t want to call a bill to the floor that could fail. “That was not the deal; the deal was that we’re taking it up regardless,” Ross said, arguing that a lack of sufficient votes to pass it shouldn’t preclude the promised vote. “There are those of us need to go back [home] and show that we’re doing all we can to do what we said we would do. And if it fails, it fails.” Ross said more than 200 ag groups support the bill, including the American Farm Bureau Federation. E-verify dispute: A state-level spat has also emerged, with some California Republicans and local groups at odds over one of the bill’s provisions. Republicans in the big ag state are wary of backing the legislation because it includes a new requirement that all employers verify the legal status of their workers, known as E-Verify. And some agriculture groups in the state are calling on them to reject the guest-worker bill because they fear the requirement would make it too difficult to find eligible workers. The California Farm Bureau and Western Growers Association, among other ag groups, came out swinging against the legislation behind the scenes, according to emails obtained by POLITICO. Supporters of the measure believe those groups got through to McCarthy, who keeps the House floor schedule. McCarthy’s allies say the No. 2 House Republican has no problem going up against home-state agriculture interests when needed — and the decision not to hold a vote has nothing to do with the groups, they said. “We have every intention of voting on this,” McCarthy spokesman Matt Sparks said in a statement. “After discussions between leadership and a broad coalition of members it was decided more work needs to be done and should be done to gather the support necessary to pass the legislation.” HAPPY TUESDAY, JULY 24!

SENATE COULD SOON PUSH FARM BILL TO CONFERENCE: Senate Agriculture Chairman Pat Roberts hopes today is the day senators will green-light the process of formally reconciling the House and Senate farm bills — it’s just up to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s schedule. Roberts told reporters Monday night that a vote on a motion to move to conference is likely to take place either today or Wednesday. Regardless of the timing, Roberts said Congress’ top four Agriculture leaders will meet on Wednesday to begin hashing out the details. The numbers game: Roberts expects nine senators will be named to the conference committee to go toe-to-toe with the 47 members selected for the panel by House leadership. “I am delighted that I will have 47 of the House members over to greet me with whatever advice and council they have,” Roberts said, tongue in cheek. When asked what he plans to tell House Agriculture Chairman Mike Conaway about the Senate bill, Roberts simply said: “It passed 86-11.” SENATE AG SET TO VET TWO NOMINEES: Senate Agriculture today will hold a hearing on the nominations of James Hubbard, to be USDA undersecretary for natural resources and environment, and Dan Berkovitz, the administration’s pick for a Democratic commissioner slot on the CFTC. Hubbard is a 30-year veteran of the Colorado Forest Service. He worked at the Interior Department and served as director of the Office of Wildland Fire Coordination and was deputy chief for state and private forestry at the USDA Forest Service. Berkovitz, a partner at law firm WilmerHale, was general counsel at the derivatives regulator from 2009 to 2013. He was widely expected to be named the nominee for the Democratic post, which the White House announced in April. The term expires in April 2023. Hubbard’s background: More than 150 forestry and agriculture groups support him being confirmed for the role of overseeing the management, conservation and protection of the nation’s forests and lands. In a letter to Roberts and committee ranking member Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the coalition called Hubbard a “career public servant with an impeccable record, and a clear dedication to both forest management and conservation.” Slow-go on Perdue’s USDA leadership buildout: The hearing comes as several USDA nominees are caught up in the Senate — a delay that Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has lamented in multiple public statements. The White House’s picks for major leadership roles at the department — Mindy Brashears, the nominee for undersecretary for food safety, and Scott Hutchins, for undersecretary for research, education and economics — are still waiting to receive a confirmation hearing. (Brashears was selected in May while Hutchins’ selection was announced just last week). The backlog doesn’t end there. Naomi Earp was selected to be assistant secretary for USDA’s Civil Rights division in February, but there’s been no movement on her nomination. And Stephen Vaden, the nominee to be USDA’s general counsel, has been waiting the longest: His selection was announced way back in November 2017. He’s been serving in a deputy capacity since March, however. ** A message from the Alliance for Fair Sugar Policy: American small businesses and manufacturing workers deserve a fair sugar policy that works for everyone in the supply chain – from farm to retail shelf.

Learn about our efforts at FairSugarPolicy.org. ** DIVING DEEPER INTO U.S.-CANADA DAIRY TRADE: President Donald Trump’s continuous criticism of Canada’s restrictive dairy trade policies — a major sticking point between the two countries in the NAFTA renegotiation — has kept milk producers in the headlines. But the complex nature of the crossborder dairy trade often gets lost amid the tweets and quick-takes. Monday’s edition of MA noted Trump was correct when tweeting that Canada charges steep tariffs on U.S. dairy. The duties aren’t 275 percent across the board, as he said, but instead vary by product. Canada imposes those tariffs once a set quota for duty-free access is fulfilled, and the Trump administration is trying to knock them lower as part of NAFTA negotiations. The National Milk Producers Federation contends the U.S. is still largely blocked out of some Canadian markets for dairy products. Take fluid milk, for example. Canada asserts that crossborder customers (those who travel to the U.S. to shop) fulfill a more than 60,000 ton fluid milk quota set by the WTO, or some 17 million gallons, given the millions of day-trips Canadians take to the U.S. annually. These shoppers are allowed to return with 2 gallons of milk per car. “We’re not aware of how Canada tracks that this is in fact taking place,” said Jaime Castaneda, senior vice president of trade policy for NMPF and the U.S. Dairy Export Council. “Moreover, we doubt that most other sectors of the U.S. economy would consider that they have ample trade access if they are relying solely on consumers crossing the border … to buy their products rather than being able to ship commercially to buyers.” About that surplus: USDA data shows the U.S. ran a $474 million surplus in dairy trade with Canada last year. However, Castaneda said that a “sizable portion” of those sales entered Canada under import-for-re-export programs, meaning they likely are sold back to the U.S. Castaneda’s group has requested data on those programs from Canada’s government, he said, but the Canadians have released little information due to confidentiality concerns. Meanwhile, Canada’s dairy industry has argued that even if U.S. exports under such programs were subtracted from the trade balance, an equivalent amount of Canadian exports also would have to be subtracted — meaning the trade balance would still favor the U.S. Butter is better: U.S. dairy producers had increasingly sent ultra-filtered milk across the border duty-free — a notable exception to Canada’s restrictive dairy market. With butter back in vogue, the milk protein left over from producing it was in large supply, and used to make cheese and yogurt. Because ultra-filtered milk wasn’t an ingredient when NAFTA first took effect, it entered Canada freely. But Canada’s new “Class 7” pricing system lowered the price of its own milk protein, stiffening competition with U.S. producers. The U.S. and Canadian dairy sectors disagree over whether the policy is trade compliant or not. PEDIATRICIANS WANT MORE OVERSIGHT OF FOOD ADDITIVES: An army of pediatricians has jumped into the long-running debate over how Washington regulates (and doesn’t regulate) food additives. On Monday, the American Academy of Pediatrics formally called for stricter regulation of not just additives but also food contact substances and even urged parents to avoid plastic — all to help children avoid any potential health risks from exposure. The group's new policy statement notes there is limited data on how various food chemicals affect the health of infants and children, but contends that infants and children are ""generally more vulnerable to chemical exposures."" The statement highlights particular concern around chemicals that can disrupt the endocrine system, like bisphenols and phthalates. Refresh your memory: The food additive regulatory system has been under fire for many years. One of the biggest complaints has long been that the vast majority of substances used in food are self-determined by manufacturers to be GRAS and do not go through pre-market approval via a formal food-additive petition process. Under GRAS, companies are encouraged but not required to notify FDA of GRAS determinations. Tips for parents: In addition to calling for stricter regulation, the group also made recommendations for pediatricians who are looking to help parents limit children's exposure to chemicals used in food and food packaging. The group's recommendations include that parents make eating fresh and frozen fruit and vegetables a priority. It also recommends limiting the consumption of processed meats (particularly during pregnancy), avoiding use of plastic when microwaving food and milk, including breast milk, and avoiding plastic food containers altogether. ROW CROPS: — Impossible Burger scores win from FDA: Impossible Foods’ famed ‘bleeding’ veggie burger has received a “no questions” letter from the FDA for its heme, a key ingredient in the burger. It’s a big win for the Silicon Valley startup, which had weathered negative press coverage after the agency had questions about its GRAS determination.

U.K. Secretary of State for International Trade Liam Fox will also raise concerns about the Trump administration's decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the EU and call instead for a multilateral solution to global issues of overcapacity in those two sectors, according to a U.K. Embassy spokesman. More from Pro Trade’s Doug Palmer here. — USDA to invest $17.4 in rural communities: USDA is delivering $17.4 million in loans and grants to rural communities for projects including renovating a health center and the purchase of commercial property to house police and fire departments, USDA announced Monday. The money will be invested in 41 projects across 22 states, from Alabama to Washington, and affect more than 220,000 rural residents. Pro Ag’s Catherine Boudreau has more. — Plant-based “milk” spat could raise First Amendment concerns: The Good Food Institute, a nonprofit that promotes plant-based and cell-cultured food, is urging the FDA to carefully consider potential First Amendment concerns as the agency looks to revamp its approach to labeling standards for dairy replacement products like almond milk and soy yogurt, Pro Ag’s Helena Bottemiller Evich reports. In a letter to FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb on Monday, Jessica Almy, policy director of GFI, argues that a crackdown on use of the term ""milk"" in nondairy, plant-based products could run afoul of First Amendment protection of free speech. — USDA opposes global guidelines for farm animal antibiotics: The Trump administration is resisting the World Health Organization’s effort to pull back on antibiotic use in livestock, Bloomberg reports. U.S. officials said the WHO guidelines are not supported by sound science, and are working to draft alternative guidelines seen as more favorable to the meat industry. — Nature’s Path quits Organic Trade Association: Organic food company Nature’s Path has split ways with the Organic Trade Association over disagreement concerning a number of issues, such as the addition of members BASF, Cargill, Campbell’s and General Mills, as well OTA’s acceptance of hydroponics in organic food.

Story Continued Below Speaking with reporters late Tuesday, House Ag Chairman Mike Conaway pulled out the farm bill countdown he has on his phone. The Texas Republican would not discuss whether he thinks Congress needs to extend current law if it cant reach a bicameral deal on H.R. 2 (115) this week. Im unwilling to have that conversation with anybody as long as theres still time on the clock, he said. But Conaway acknowledged that in previous cycles when the law expired, the world didnt stop turning. Keep on trucking: The House is scheduled to be in session for the next two weeks, though that could change as members are eager to campaign ahead of the midterms. Regardless, both Conaway and House ranking member Collin Peterson said they are willing to stay in town to keep farm bill talks going. Putting this off makes no sense whatsoever, Conaway said, adding: I assure you, Im not very smart right now but I wont be any smarter in October. The decisions to be made are on the table; you simply have to have the will to make them. The slow go: Its going slow, but were making progress, Peterson told POLITICO late Tuesday, noting that the key lawmakers hoped to make some progress in their meeting this morning.

FARMERS DAY IN COURT OVER GIPSA RULES: Farmers from Alabama and Nebraska will appear today in a federal appeals court in St. Louis to make their case against Perdues decision last year to scrap two proposed GIPSA rules. The rules: In one of his first moves as secretary, Perdue rolled back two proposals under USDAs Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration that would have made it easier for livestock farmers and poultry growers to challenge meatpacking or processing companies that engage in potentially unfair business practices. The court case: Poultry farmers suing USDA are backed by the nonprofit legal group Democracy Forward and the Organization for Competitive Markets, an advocacy group. Oral arguments start today in St. Louis before the U.S. Appeals Court for the 8th Circuit. The plaintiffs argue that USDA defied Congress and failed to provide a legitimate reason for slashing the GIPSA rules. Joe Maxwell, OCMs executive director and former Missouri lieutenant governor, tells your host the case means everything to Americas independent family farmers, to be ensured they can have a fair shake in the marketplace. With these global goliaths out there that control the market, today oftentimes theres just one buyer. They use predatory or retaliatory-type abusive practices to squeeze the farmer, or tell them to go broke because were not buying your goods, Maxwell said Tuesday. Supporters of the rollback, including agribusinesses and some GOP ag lawmakers, have said the GIPSA rules would have unleashed a flood of unwarranted litigation against agribusinesses.

A new report released Tuesday found that EPAs Office of Pesticide Programs is unable to determine that such protections are being maintained. The Office of the Inspector General directed the agency to develop outcome-based performance metrics. But EPA told the watchdog that this was neither appropriate nor feasible. An agency spokesman, in response to Pro Ags request for further information, said we have no other comments. What are emergency exemptions? All pesticides sold in the U.S. must be licensed by EPA for specific uses, but the agency can allow chemicals to be applied for an unlicensed use in certain situations like unexpected pests and resistant strains of insects or weeds that jeopardize public health or agricultural production. Nearly all of these exemptions are granted to address threats to crops, according to OIG. What critics say: Environmental groups, including the Center for Biological Diversity, accuse EPA of misusing the exemption process in non-emergency situations. The Center on Tuesday sent out a press release noting that EPA this year has granted 19 exemptions for sulfoxaflor, an insecticide, to be used on cotton and sorghum even though the pests its used to eradicate have posed problems for years. A decision by the Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit directed EPA to reevaluate its approved uses of sulfoxaflor in order to protect bees, which resulted in the removal of cotton and sorghum. Advice from OIG: The watchdog said that the pesticide programs office collects human health and environmental data through the emergency exemption application process. However, this data is not used to capture the scope, or the potential benefits and risks, of each exemption. The OIG made a total of eight recommendations. EPA agreed to take action on three that focused on strengthening controls on data collection to make sure its consistent and updating internal guidance. BAYER EXEC STANDS BY DICAMBA: A Bayer executive defended the herbicide dicamba as an important tool that helps farmers fight damaging weeds, even as he acknowledged that it faced some challenges. Use of dicamba has doubled to 50 million acres since it was first rolled out onto fields two years ago, Brett Begemann, chief operating officer for Bayers crop science division, told reporters on Monday at a Bayer office in Kansas City, Mo. Despite its initial popularity with farmers, dicamba has had a devastating unintended effect: Drift from the herbicide has ruined millions of acres of crops across the Midwest. The damage has been so widespread that some environmental and consumer groups have called for EPA to deny re-registration of the herbicide a decision thats expected soon. Monsanto, which was just acquired by Bayer, attributed the damage to farmers misapplying the product. About that deal: Bayer and Monsanto are getting into the nitty gritty of combining their operations since they were finally given the green light to do so by the Justice Department over the summer. Begemann said theres work to be done in the next months as parts of Monsanto are folded into its German parent. As for farmers, Begemann said theyve had some concerns about the deal and how it might affect them, but theyve made clear that their top priority is having the option of new and better products. What theyre asking about is how fast are you going to bring me innovation, he said. USTR PESSIMISTIC ON NAFTA DEAL WITH CANADA SOON: U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer was even more pessimistic than usual, playing down hopes for a NAFTA deal with Canada in the coming days. In comments at the Concordia Summit in New York, Lighthizer cited very large issues to resolve, Pro Trades Doug Palmer reports. The fact is Canada is not making concessions in areas where we think it is essential, Lighthizer said. The administration must release the text by Sunday, under fast-track rules, if it wants to sign a deal before Mexican President Enrique Peña Nietos last day in office on Nov. 30. Failure to sign a new trade deal before then would throw a whole new wrinkle into the process, the trade chief added. Missing that deadline means starting new negotiations with the incoming president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, and we dont know where that would go at all, he said. Not lookin up on China, either: Lighthizer also offered a grim outlook for negotiations between the two superpowers, blasting China as unreliable and slow to make good on its trade promises over the years, Pro Trades Adam Behsudi reports. The U.S. slapped duties on another $200 billion in Chinese imports, effective Monday, and China retaliated with new taxes on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods. The barrage of tariffs was an attempt to change the paradigm after years of fruitless negotiations that have yielded few results for U.S. farmers and businesses, Lighthizer said. Separately, Chinas Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said its hard for the nations to talk while Washington holds a knife to Chinas neck not a great sign for anyone hoping for a negotiated solution.

The letter is here. New agency sought to control foodborne illnesses: The United Fresh Produce Association will ask Congress to set up an independent federal agency to review foodborne disease outbreaks. Investigations are now handled by numerous federal and state agencies, meaning response times are too slow, said UFPA leaders at the groups conference in Washington. POLITICOs Sarah Zimmerman was on the scene. Ross issues disaster declaration for West Coast fisheries: Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross declared commercial failures for salmon fisheries in Washington, Oregon and California and sardine fisheries in California. Salmon stocks in the Klamath River are declining after years of droughts in California and other environmental conditions, Pro Ags Catherine Boudreau writes. Capping farm subsidies: A bipartisan group of 34 House and Senate lawmakers is urging the farm bill negotiators to preserve provisions in the Senate version that would limit farms to one manager who can qualify as actively engaged in the business, and therefore eligible for $125,000 a year in commodity subsidies. In a letter sent this morning spearheaded by Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), along with House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.) the lawmakers also advocate for a provision that would cap the income eligibility threshold at $700,000 a year in gross income.

112,Consequences of a missed farm bill deadline,Fate of WIC and SNAP in public charge rule — The state-of-play on tariffs — What’s holding up NAFTA?,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-agriculture/2018/09/24/consequences-of-a-missed-farm-bill-deadline-349354,2018-09-24T14:00:28Z,"With help from Catherine Boudreau, Helena Bottemiller Evich and Maya Parthasarathy WHAT IF FARM BILL DEADLINE IS MISSED?: Congress has less than a week to pass a new farm bill, H.R. 2 (115), before the current law expires on Sept. 30, and negotiators remain far apart on major issues. Story Continued Below Yet an extension of current law isnt being considered yet, sources familiar with the talks tell Pro Ags Catherine Boudreau and Helena Bottemiller Evich. Such a move would be politically risky for farm-state politicians facing reelection, but there are other consequences, too. A world with no farm bill extension: Senate Agriculture Chairman Pat Roberts and ranking member Debbie Stabenow have suggested that an extension may not be necessary until December, presumably because commodity policy wouldnt revert to decades-old law until January. But if a deal isnt reached before the new Congress meets on Jan. 3, both the House and Senate would need to reintroduce the legislation and take another vote. Programs in limbo: Major conservation initiatives, for instance, would be in a tough spot. There would be mandatory funding available, but USDAs authority to operate the programs expires at the end of the fiscal year. Meanwhile, dozens of lower-profile programs like those promoting international trade, local and regional food systems and bioenergy development would be left in the lurch. The $34.5 million Foreign Market Development program is among them. Farm groups that utilize the funding to staff offices overseas told POLITICO they may have to start shutting down programming the longer Congress goes without passing a new farm bill.

Watch the livestream here on September 28. ** WHATS IN AND OUT OF TRUMP PUBLIC CHARGE RULE: The Trump administration has released a proposed rule that could bar legal immigrants from getting green cards if they use a broad range of benefits, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The move is aimed at bolstering the GOP base ahead of the midterm elections, POLITICOs Ted Hesson, Nancy Cook, Helena Bottemiller Evich and Andrew Restuccia reported. WIC dropped from list: The proposal which the Department of Homeland Security posted on Saturday following a POLITICO inquiry has been somewhat reined in from previous leaked versions. One big change: The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, known as WIC, was dropped from the list of programs that would count against an applicant. Media reports this year about the Trump administration's plans to issue the proposed rule led to anxiety and misinformation in immigrant communities, local health providers say. The chilling effect: Even without a change in policy, immigrants are already dropping out of WIC over immigration-related fears. Pro Ags Helena Bottemiller Evich reported earlier this month that local health care providers in at least 18 states saw drops of up to 20 percent in benefit enrollment a sign that the mere threat of a black mark can drive people away from government assistance. Plenty of fury: Despite some changes to the scope of the rule, many public health advocates and groups representing immigrants are appalled by the proposal. Anti-hunger groups are also extremely concerned that low-income families will be further discouraged from accessing SNAP even when they need the help. Lets be clear, said Jim Weill, president of the Food Research &amp; Action Center over the weekend. No low-income people who are eligible for anti-hunger programs should be deterred, penalized, stigmatized, or suffer adverse immigration consequences for their legally authorized use of public benefits.

MORE TARIFFS ON AG PRODUCTS IN FORCE: Chinese retaliatory tariffs on a host of U.S. agricultural goods take effect today, ratcheting up a monthslong trade war. China is hitting another $60 billion of American goods with duties, bringing the total value of goods facing tariffs to $113 billion. Exports like salted beef, pig casings, frozen peas and canned spinach will now face 5 or 10 percent duties. Virtually every U.S. food and agriculture product is now subject to Chinese tariffs. The trade scoreboard: President Donald Trump last week stuck new taxes on $200 billion in Chinese imports also effective today exponentially increasing the total value of targeted goods from about $53 billion all the way to $253 billion. There are no signs the tariff ping-pong will end anytime soon. As Pro Trades Doug Palmer reported Friday, another round of U.S.-China trade talks sought by the Trump administration has not been scheduled. The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday that even a lower-level trade meeting planned for this week has been called off. Political fallout: Trumps trade battles could weigh on Republicans ahead of the November midterms, as companies record lower exports and consumers pay higher prices going into the holiday season. In swing states and districts, Democrats see an opening to sap support from Republicans among groups like apple and cherry growers in Washington state, POLITICOs Ben White writes. You are going to see close races where this is actually a decisive issue, said Scott Lincicome, a trade lawyer and adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute. In Iowa another key battleground state corn, soybean and hog farmers could face up to $2.2 billion in lost revenue as a result of the trade disputes, according to a new Iowa State University study. The effects could ripple through the states economy in many different ways: sales tax receipts could fall and jobs could be lost as farmers cut back on spending, the Des Moines Register explains. Relief for cherry and almond growers? Meanwhile, in USDAs latest effort to offset some of the agricultural damage, the department is offering additional financial help for producers of two specialty crops. Sweet cherry and almond producers will now be eligible for direct payments under USDAs market facilitation program. USDA will pay out 3 cents per pound of shelled almonds and 16 cents per pound of sweet cherries, although the department didnt say in its announcement how much of the initial $4.7 billion pot would go to growers of the fruit and nuts. Both items were also on USDAs list of planned commodity purchases. The department initially said it would buy up $63 million worth of almonds and $111 million of sweet cherries. That buy-up plan was somewhat of a surprise. The fresh sweet cherry season was already over, meaning it wouldnt be possible to purchase any of the fruit from this years crop. Helena breaks it down for Pros here. DAIRY COULD BE NAFTA DEAL-BREAKER: Trade negotiators have struggled for months over demands by U.S. officials that Canada open up its dairy markets to American producers by expanding import quotas and changing its pricing policy for protein-rich Class 7 milk. Its perhaps the most confounding issue holding up a three-way North American trade deal. Now, its starting to look like a deal-breaker, according to a senior Trump administration official Doug writes. Canada sees it differently: One top Canadian official said negotiators have made headway on the dairy dispute. He said 60 percent of what needs to be resolved is the dispute-resolution mechanism in NAFTAs Chapter 19, which Canada wants to maintain in its current form. A provision in the chapter allows one country to challenge another country's duties if it believes they have been unfairly applied. Canada also is seeking to be excluded from steel and aluminum tariffs as well as any tariffs resulting from an ongoing inquiry into auto imports on national security grounds. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland left Washington last week without announcing any breakthroughs or any firm plans for in-person meetings this week with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. Negotiators are seeking a three-way deal in time for Trump to submit text of a new trade agreement to Congress by Sept. 30. Keep an eye on NYC: Lighthizer will be in New York this week with Trump. whos set to address the UN General Assembly on Tuesday. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will be there with Freeland, too. Theyre scheduled to speak on a panel Tuesday at the Council on Foreign Relations. Stay tuned for any possible trade talks on the sidelines of the gathering. ROW CROPS: Republicans punt their problems until lame-duck: Why do now what you can put off until after the November midterm elections? Congressional Republicans plan to avoid dealing with the trickiest political and legislative headaches like paying for Trumps border wall and possibly confirming a new attorney general until after Nov. 6. POLITICOs Burgess Everett and Rachael Bade have the story. Hurricane Florence recovery aid on the way: A new emergency spending bill, H.R. 302 (115), would provide $1.7 billion to help states rebuild and recover from Hurricane Florence. House Appropriations Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen said Sunday that the legislation was a first round of disaster aid. Worries for a cash crop: North Carolina accounts for well over half of the national harvest of sweet potatoes. The damage from Hurricane Florence is putting the states crop in doubt, The Charlotte Observer reports. Russian ag sales surge: Russian farmers are poised to benefit from retaliatory tariffs affecting already-hurting U.S. producers. Farmers in Russia also have lower costs, making their overseas sales more valuable, The Wall Street Journal writes. Energy-Water spending bill enacted: Trump on Friday signed into law a three-bill minibus appropriations package, H.R. 5895 (115), including $44.6 billion for energy programs and water projects. Theres still a chance other agencies could shut down starting Oct. 1, if Trump refuses to sign a second spending package containing a continuing resolution that the House is expected to clear this week.

At this year’s Potato Science Live events, he reported that Syngenta Operation Pollinator research, in conjunction with ASDA, had demonstrated clear improvements in soil protection and structure on areas sown using a Green Headland seed mix alongside crops, along with the opportunity to reduce nutrient leaching. The Green Headland Mix (pictured below), developed by seed specialists, Kings, incorporates vetches, clover, phacelia and radish. Sown in late spring to achieve fast growth, it generated 36 tonnes/ha of green organic matter over the summer, including capturing 106 kg N/ha, that would help improve soil structure and fertility. “The cover crop can help to trap and retain soil movement in the field, whilst the rooting acts to stabilise the soil surface and protect from damage by tractors and irrigation equipment through the crop’s growing operations, advocated Dr Newbert.” Furthermore, independent insect monitoring of the ecologically enhanced Green Headland sites in 2017 sampled 41,000 invertebrates, involving 312 different species. Of those, 60 species were identified as being positive pollinators for crops and 113 known to be predators or parasitoids during their life cycle, including targeting crop pests. Chris Brown, ASDA Senior Director of Sustainable Sourcing (above), highlighted the project demonstrated the good stewardship of farmland by growers. “This initiative highlights the efforts of UK growers to work towards increasing biodiversity and protecting resources. “Planting up Green Headlands is a genuinely sustainable solution. It can offer a simple, cost effective and time efficient option to make better use of a hitherto unused area of land, that will improve the environment and to protect soil and water.” The Reuters editorial and news staff had no role in the production of this content.

114,British farmers worry: Who will pick the fruit after Brexit?,Agriculture has depended on seasonal workers from elsewhere in the E.U.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/british-farmers-worry-who-will-pick-the-fruit-after-brexit/2018/07/28/a597b9ec-7f03-11e8-a63f-7b5d2aba7ac5_story.html,2018-07-29T22:01:09Z,"HAREWOOD END, England — After a dozen futile calls to big farms, agricultural lobbyists and labor contractors, we finally found him. The rarest of the rare, the British berry picker. Meet Max Hughes, a 20-year-old university student and history major, who is spending his summer harvesting blackcurrants at the Snell family farm in Herefordshire. He rides in the back of a harvester all day, standing beside a Czech migrant and a couple of sun-bronzed Romanian guys, who know very little English. “No matter, you can’t hear a thing they say over the noise,” Hughes said, gesturing toward the wheeled harvester beside him. Its vibrating metal fingers shake the currant bushes and bring the tart berries via conveyor belt to the sorting table, where Hughes and his teammates discard the leaves, twigs, slugs and occasional mouse — whatever you don’t want to see in a frozen fruit pack. Britain today is completely dependent on foreign workers to pick its fruit and vegetables. According to the National Farmers Union, an industry lobbying group, of the 60,000 seasonal workers in the fields last year, barely one percent was British. The vast majority come from Eastern Europe, particularly Bulgaria and Romania. As long as Britain has remained part of the European Union, by treaty its doors have been wide-open to the “free movement” of fellow members, including those seasonal farmworkers who come for four or five months, get paid in British pounds and return home for the winter. But as Britain prepares to leave the E.U., bringing the era of free movement to a close, farmers have begun to panic: Who will pick the crops next spring? Already, labor shortages driven by economic shifts have left produce rotting in the strawberry fields and the high-tech, hydroponic poly-tunnels where top-tier soft fruit is produced. Jacqui Green, chief executive of the Berry Gardens growers cooperative, reports a 30 to 40 percent shortfall in labor this year. “It's pretty grim,” Green said. “And it’s probably going to get worse before it potentially gets better, post-Brexit.” During the 2016 Brexit campaign, anxiety over mass migration was top of mind, fueled in part by claims that, for example, millions of Muslims would arrive as soon as Turkey joined the E.U. (Turkey is not in the union and has no prospect of joining in the foreseeable future.) With Britain’s exit from the bloc, Prime Minister Theresa May vows that the country will regain “ control of our borders ” and dramatically curtail immigration. Yet critics of Brexit argue that Britain desperately needs foreign workers — not only “the best and brightest” in finance, tech and medicine, who May promises will still be welcome, but those who clean hotel rooms in Brighton, man kitchens in London and harvest tomatoes in Norfolk. If far fewer workers come from Europe, those jobs will have to be filled by Brits — who don’t seem very keen, truth be told — or contracted from Belarus or Nepal or the Philippines. Britain had such a foreign farmworker scheme in the past, but it was scrapped — and now there are growing calls to restart it. Stephanie Maurel, the chief executive of Concordia, a recruitment company that supplies workers to about 200 British farms, said they’ve had virtually zero Brits apply. “We’ve had two applications out of 10,000,” she said. “It’s statistically quite damning.” Asked why Brits aren’t high on the work, she recited the list: early hours, long days, physical toll, seasonality, lack of affordable transport, “and, quite simply, the farms aren’t in places with high levels of unemployment.” And, unless you’re a local, you live in a trailer. Often a nice trailer, with WiFi, but still. Maurel said some Brits work in less taxing farm jobs — as logistics managers or office staff — but even those higher-paying, indoor jobs are mostly taken by Eastern Europeans these days. She said the rare British workers who give the fruit and vegetable harvest a try, “literally don’t last a week.” Hughes and three other university students are the only Brits harvesting berries at the Snell family farm this summer, out of a workforce of 300. “That’s quite something, isn’t it?” said Christine Snell who owns the award-winning, environmentally sensitive farm with her husband, Anthony. “We want to get the message across: If we could recruit British workers, we would, but we cannot.” Snell drove a Washington Post reporter out to see these exotic British berryworkers. They looked hot and dusty but otherwise like healthy contestants on a reality TV show. For Hughes, the long workday begins at 5 a.m. and ends in the late afternoon. He said with overtime and bonuses for quick sorting, he could make almost $4,000 for six weeks of six-day work. The worst part, he said, is the dull, repetitive nature of the job. He zones out by listening to music through his ear buds. “It’s not a bad summer job,” he said. But he and his mates think they understand why so few Brits want farm jobs. “A lot of kids would never do this kind of work,” said Lewis Hiscox, 24, a recent graduate from Harper Adams University, who was working on the blackcurrant harvester, too. “They’d rather give London a try for more money, more fun. Also, there’s the snob thing. Farm work is associated with Eastern Europeans,” meaning “work for poor people.” Many observers have suggested that Brits today are “too lazy” to do the farm work of their yeoman ancestors. Hiscox said that physically, “the British worker could definitely do this job.” He said the work provides an “outdoor life” and decent pay for a young person. Elliot Packham, 22, who just graduated from Cardiff University, wondered, “If the pay were better, more might try?” He noted that then strawberries would cost more. “So there’s the economics of it,” he said. Some British commentators have suggested that maybe recently released felons could be employed on the farms — the way German prisoners of war were used during World War II. Others have wondered if hale and hearty Britons living on social welfare benefits could be prodded to bend their backs to bring in a crop of strawberries. (Though those who receive such benefits may question if the work would be worth the risk of not requalifying for benefits after the season ends.) Gabriela Yuganaru, a 50-year-old Romanian crew leader on the Snell farm, has been picking for 10 years. “If it was so hard, why would I come back? Your back is sore, okay? A fast picker can make 100 pounds in a day.” She said, “Maybe the government gives people too much money not to work. I don’t know.” She said back home the governments are not so generous. “Better to work,” she said. Helen Whately, a Conservative party politician who chairs the all-party parliamentary group for fruit and vegetable farmers, said growers would be facing a shortage of labor without Brexit, but the vote to leave the E.U. has “arguably made the problem a bit more acute.” Already, it has contributed to a weakening of the pound, thus decreasing the financial incentives for foreign workers, at the same time that economies are improving in source countries, such as Romania. Whately is campaigning for a seasonal agricultural workers scheme that could include countries outside of the E.U. and would allow pickers to come and work for a defined and limited period of time. Other than that? Robots? But berries are notoriously difficult to pick mechanically, Snell said. Adrian Cirstea, the packing house and logistics manager at the Snell farm, who is originally from Romania, imagines that after Brexit, British growers will have look far and wide for labor. “They’ll have to go further east and further south,” he said, to Africa and Asia, to find workers. Meaning that Britain may see the same number of foreign farmworkers, but fewer Bulgarians and more from Eritrea and Moldova. Maybe even Turkey. Adam reported from London.

115,"FEATURE-In Kenya, struggling potato growers ink a new deal","By Kagondu NjagiKIPIPIRI, Kenya, Jan 8 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -S itting on a rickety bench at his home in Kipipiri, in centralKenya, Samuel Macharia pulls a piece of paper from his pocketand proudly points to the signature at the bottom.""This paper mean…",https://www.reuters.com/article/kenya-farming-weather/feature-in-kenya-struggling-potato-growers-ink-a-new-deal-idUSL8N1P02C8,2018-01-08T01:55:48Z,"KIPIPIRI, Kenya, Jan 8 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - S itting on a rickety bench at his home in Kipipiri, in central Kenya, Samuel Macharia pulls a piece of paper from his pocket and proudly points to the signature at the bottom. “This paper means I get paid on time for my potatoes, even when the weather is bad,” he said. The precious document is a farming contract Macharia signed in March with the East African Potato Consortium. It says he will sell at least two tonnes of potatoes to food processors each harvesting season for the next two years. “Thanks to this contract I can earn up to 22,000 Kenyan shillings ($213) per season,” he said. Recurring drought and sudden cold spells have affected the quality of potatoes and other staples across Kenya. Peris Mukami, a farmer from Timau village, in Meru County, said her potato yields had declined by over 10 percent in the past two years because “it is either too cold or too hot”. “The cold damages potato vines with frostbite while heat makes them wilt,” she explained. To try to fight back, Kenyan potato farmers such as Macharia are increasingly turning to production contracts with food processors – a system known as contract farming – through the East African Potato Consortium. By working with the consortium, they get access to seeds that better stand up to harsher conditions, as well as better fertilisers. They also get a guaranteed price for their crop, as long as they produce good-quality potatoes on time, said Wachira Kaguongo, head of the National Potato Council. FAIR DEALS The consortium, which was set up in 2016 by the National Potato Council, the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa and the Grow Africa partnership, aims to increase private investment in agriculture by linking potato farmers with food processors across the country, Kaguongo said. Each production agreement is reviewed and approved by the National Potato Council, which ensures it is fair to both parties, said Willy Bett, cabinet secretary of the Kenyan Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries. “Businessmen will always want to get farmers to sign something that may not be favourable to them,” Bett told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “We’re trying to prevent that by ensuring that farming activity is done on a contract basis in Kenya.” Contract farming has allowed farmers to sell produce to food giants such as the fast-food chain KFC, formerly known as Kentucky Fried Chicken. Macharia’s potatoes now fetch 22 shillings ($0.20) per kilo, more than double what he used to get when selling them at the Kipipiri open air market. “I am paid in cash at my farm,” he said. “And I do not have to travel to the market when I don’t want to.” So far 5,000 farmers have signed up to the system, with a total of 23,000 expected to have made the switch by 2020, said Kaguongo. SUPPLY SHORTAGE? Felix Matheri, a researcher at the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology, said that while contract farming provides farmers with a steady income, it risks depriving poor families of their food supply. “Contracts bind farmers to supplying an agreed amount of potatoes, meaning that when the harvest is low farmers are forced to sell all their produce to meet their obligations,” he explained. “But potatoes are rich in starch and a critical source of nutrients – farmers should save some for home consumption,” he said. Others have concerns about contract farming as well. Louise Wangari, a roadside seller of potatoes in Nyandarua County, said she is worried it might affect the supply she gets from farmers. “The quantity of potatoes I was getting from farmers was already decreasing due to extreme weather,” she said. ""If they start signing contracts with other buyers, then I may be out of business soon, as I can't afford to pay them as much as the food processors.""

116,Vote on farm bill too close to call,White House plan to move SNAP to HHS coming soon — Ross gets an earful on tariffs,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-agriculture/2018/06/21/vote-on-farm-bill-too-close-to-call-260178,2018-06-21T14:00:28Z,"With Helena Bottemiller Evich, Liz Crampton, Victoria Guida and Maya Parthasarathy. VOTE ON FARM BILL TOO CLOSE TO CALL: The House may vote again on the farm bill today … or tomorrow. Just one day from the deadline to reconsider the measure that failed last month, it’s still unclear what the next step is for the sweeping farm and nutrition policy legislation, report Pro Ag’s Helena Bottemiller Evich and Liz Crampton this morning. Story Continued Below The bill’s second shot has been hugely overshadowed by House Republicans’ duel over immigration. GOP leadership is planning to bring an immigration bill from Rep. Bob Goodlatte to the floor today — a condition of farm bill support from the Freedom Caucus, the conservative coalition that helped defeat it the first time round. Once that’s done, the farm bill could be voted upon immediately — or it could be kicked to Friday. The sooner, the better: House Agriculture Chairman Mike Conaway is pushing hard to have the vote today, a strategy he thinks will result in more “yes” votes since more members are likely to still be in town. But he acknowledges the tally will come down to the wire. “I think I’ve got the votes for it, but until all those green lights go up that outnumber the red lights I’m going to be a little nervous,” the Texas Republican said Wednesday. Our own whip count: A POLITICO analysis of the roll call vote from May 18, when the bill went down 198 to 213, shows that Conaway has a narrow path to 215 (the number needed to pass a bill is lower due to several vacancies). Democrats unanimously voted against H.R. 2 (115), but it was the 30 Republican votes that ultimately tanked the bill (it’s really 29 no votes, since House Speaker Paul Ryan logged a no vote for procedural reasons). GOP moderates are key : While the Freedom Caucus was widely blamed for the Republican split — and their withholding was crucial — the roster of 29 no’s also included more than a dozen more moderate Republicans including Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, John Katko of New York and Darrell Issa of California. Assuming that all lawmakers on both sides of the aisle show up and members vote the same way they did last time, Conaway would need to pick up 17 votes to get to a majority. Conveniently, there were 17 members that didn’t cast ballots during the last go around — but 10 are Democrats and seven are Republicans. POLITICO has confirmed that at least two of the Republicans who didn’t vote last time plan to vote yes, including Reps. Kevin Yoder of Kansas and Hal Rogers of Kentucky. Rep. David Valadao of California, a longtime dairy farmer, said Tuesday he was leaning yes. Get smart: Pros can read the full rundown on the farm bill whip count from Helena and Liz here.

WHITE HOUSE PLAN TO MOVE SNAP TO HHS COMING SOON: A White House plan to reorganize the federal government is expected to be out as early as today, POLITICO’s Lorraine Woellert and Helena scooped on Wednesday. The proposal will recommend renaming the agency now called Health and Human Services to the Department of Health and Public Welfare. As POLITICO reported earlier this month, it will also call for moving the $70 billion Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program from USDA to the reorganized agency, according to two people with knowledge of the plan. Reality check: Moving the food stamp program from USDA to HHS — an idea that's not likely to get traction in Congress—would be a huge blow to USDA's reach and budget. SNAP represents roughly three quarters of its budget. "" I’ll need to see the logic"": Conaway said late Wednesday he would keep an open mind when reading the White House reorganization report, but he's not wild about making HHS, which already oversees some $1 trillion in spending, even bigger. “I’ll need to see the logic behind why it makes sense to make an even larger agency out of one that’s got its issues already,"" he said. “My normal bias is that making monster agencies even bigger is maybe not the best thing to do,"" Brush up on the latest here. Also see POLITICO’s larger story from two weeks ago here. ** A message from the Alliance for Fair Sugar Policy: We believe farmers and families depending on food manufacturing workers should be central to this country’s ongoing conversation on agriculture policy.

Learn more at FairSugarPolicy.org. ** ROSS GETS EARFUL ON TRUMP TARIFFS: Finance Committee senators blasted Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Wednesday for the damage done to the U.S. agricultural sector by foreign retaliation to the administration’s steel and aluminum tariffs. American farmers “are bearing the brunt of retaliation for these actions,” Chairman Orrin Hatch said during the hearing. “I just don't see how the damage posed on all of these sectors could possibly advance our national security.” Warnings about economic harm: Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) cited complaints from Oregon potato growers and Pacific Northwest cherry growers “who have got nearly 1.5 million boxes of cherries ready to ship to China. They’re worried those cherries are going to end up stuck on the dock or rotting in a warehouse due to China’s retaliation,” Not buying national security line: Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) noted that market volatility can also make it more expensive for companies to invest in commodities to balance out the risk of other holdings. “I wish we would stop invoking national security because that’s not what this is about,” Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said. “This is about economic nationalism.” The goal is more free trade: Ross said the administration has “no control over what another country does in retaliation,” but argued the president’s most recent threat to impose tariffs on another $200 billion in Chinese products was designed to discourage further escalation. The administration’s aim, he said, is to have more free trade — not less. “The president’s objective is not to end up with high tariffs, and his objective is not to end up in a trade war,"" Ross said. “His objective is to get to a lowering of barriers, both tariffs and non-tariff ones, and to protect intellectual property.... The purpose of this is to get to an endgame that is much closer to free trade than what we’ve been before.” What about farmers? But Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) blasted Ross for not articulating a vision of how agricultural producers would be protected. “I don’t think you’re going to have any backstop for our farmers and ranchers, and to blindly pursue these policies without considering what happens to them I think is a huge mistake,” he said. Grassley wants nothing to do with handouts: Sen. Chuck Grassley had told reporters during his weekly ag briefing Monday that Trump pointed to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue before telling a group of governors and congressional lawmakers that the federal government would subsidize any losses faced by farmers due to tariffs. ""That's not what my farmers in Iowa want — help from the federal treasury,"" Grassley responded. He reiterated his displeasure about the idea to Ross at the hearing. ROW CROPS: — Trump skips Select USA: For a second year in a row, the president is not attending the annual Commerce Department event designed to attract foreign investment, Pro Trade’s Doug Palmer reports. Instead, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will appear in his place. — EPA may reallocate biofuel regs: The agency is expected on Friday to unveil a proposed rule setting biofuel blending volumes for next year that may reallocate the volumes that small refiners shed though EPA waivers in 2017 to larger refiners next year, Pro Energy’s Eric Wolff reports. — Koch brothers won’t back house farm bill: Your host reports that Conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity urged lawmakers not to vote for the bill because of its “corporate welfare provisions and wasteful spending,” and warned them their vote will be factored into their congressional scorecard. — Seafood groups speak against end of National Ocean Policy: After the administration issued an order on Tuesday revoking Barack Obama’s ocean policy, Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) demanded a hearing to address fears that the new order “will overturn years of critical ocean planning and policy.” Oceana also said in a statement “we reject the administration’s false argument that federal management of the oceans prevents their productive and sustainable use.” — That doesn't look like a farm: Picking up on the farm bill debate over subsidy reform, the Environmental Working Group analyzed USDA data to produce a study that identified people who live in urban areas yet have received subsidy payments every year for 32 straight years. — That doesn’t look like a farm: Following the Senate’s Agriculture Committee’s decision not to require subsidy recipients to live and work on farms, the Environmental Working Group published a study showing that 245 people who received taxpayer-funded farm subsidies or disaster payments live in urban areas. And in some cases, their homes — such as a $7.8 million beachside mansion — more closely resemble resorts than farms. — It’s not just pancakes making maple syrup producers smile: FDA’s decision to is reconsider the inclusion of maple syrup and honey in the Nutrition Facts label change has pleased producers like John Campbell, a spokesman for Maple Guild, the world’s largest single-source maple syrup producer. The industry, which currently depends on consumers pouring it on pancakes for 95 percent of its business, is trying to expand into the flavoring business. “The FDA is listening,” said Campbell. “We feel that’s a big victory and a big step in the right direction.” — Some surprises from rural America: A report released by the Joint Economic Committee Democrats found that rural families on average earn 25 percent less than their urban counterparts. But they live in areas with some of the nation’s highest rates of upward economic mobility. They also have far higher homeownership rates than their urban counterparts, with more than 70 percent of occupied rural housing being owned instead of rented. Find the report here. — U.S.-China trade dispute hurts Brazil: Brazilian Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi on Tuesday called the trade dispute between the U.S. and China “very detrimental” to Brazil’s business interests. The country is a large exporter of commodities like meat and soybeans, Reuters reports. — Report recommends lower PFAS safe level: An HHS report released today recommends a much lower safe level of toxic fluorinated chemicals than EPA sanctioned earlier. “Minimal risk level” for exposure to the chemicals PFOA and PFOS should be seven to 10 times lower than what EPA previously recommended, according to the report, which was originally suppressed by EPA, DoD and the White House over fears it would cause a “public relations nightmare.” More from EWG here. — REVOLVING DOOR: Andrew Schmidt is now manager of agriculture policy at Ducks Unlimited. He previously was agriculture policy program manager for the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. THAT'S ALL FOR MA! See you again soon!

117,Why roses cost what they do,Why roses cost what they do washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2018/02/10/feature/colombia-rose-trade-industry-valentines-day/,2018-02-10T23:07:28Z,"The majority of roses Americans give one another on Valentine’s Day, roughly 200 million in all, grow here, the savanna outside Bogota, summoned from the soil by 12 hours of natural sunlight, the 8,400-foot altitude and an abundance of cheap labor. Thousands of acres of white-tarped greenhouses, some the size of several football fields, are crammed with seven-foot stems topped with rich red crowns. Many are pulled into warehouses by horses, chilled to sleep in refrigeration rooms, and then packed with other flowers onto planes — 1.1 million at a time — to be sold in the United States. It’s peak season for a massive Colombian industry that shipped more than 4 billion flowers to the United States last year — or about a dozen for every U.S. resident. The Colombian industry has bloomed thanks to a U.S. effort to disrupt cocaine trafficking, the expansion of free-trade agreements — and the relentless demand by American consumers for cheap roses. The transformation demonstrates the barreling, often brutal, efficiency of globalization: In 27 years, market forces and decisions made in Washington have reshaped the rose business on two continents. The American flower industry has seen its production of roses drop roughly 95 percent, falling from 545 million to less than 30 million. It’s just the kind of decline that President Trump has railed against. Trump, who recently took action against foreign sellers of solar panels and washing machines, is now considering tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as a withdrawal from the North American Free Trade Agreement, changes that would reach deep into the American economy. He has promised an unapologetic “America First” agenda that some U.S. flower growers hope could bring them back into the Valentine’s Day rush. But the rose industry offers a striking reminder of why it is so hard to roll back the economic relationships between countries. Where it used to face horrific violence and corruption, Colombia has nurtured an industry that produces roses faster and cheaper than anywhere in the United States — and can even get them to many U.S. retailers faster than domestic growers. And in the United States, corporate giants such as Walmart and its competitors have replaced florists as the top seller of roses, ordering flowers in huge masses for consumers who have little interest in paying for the cost of a domestically grown rose. Roses are bred Colombians don’t even celebrate Valentine’s Day, but among flower growers, the foreign holiday can account for close to 20 percent of annual revenue. The volume of the rose trade is breathtaking. In the three weeks leading up to Feb. 14, 30 cargo jets make the trip from Colombia to Miami each day, with each plane toting more than a million flowers. From Miami’s airport, the flowers are loaded into refrigerated trucks — 200 are needed each day — and from there many go to warehouses in South Florida, where they are repackaged, assembled into bouquets, and then shipped all over the country. Cut flower imports from Colombia during the Valentine’s Day season have skyrocketed in recent years 694m 600m 400m 200m 97m 0 2009 2015 Note: “Valentine’s Day season” includes all cut flower imports between Jan. 1 and Feb. 14. Source: U.S. Customs and Border Protection cut flower imports annual report THE WASHINGTON POST A rose is both a symbol of love and a commodity, and American buyers want them to be simultaneously stunning and produced en masse. Colombia found a way to meet these demands. Walmart alone is purchasing 24 million Colombian roses to sell for Valentine’s Day. One of its senior associates, Deborah Zoellick, is so well known in Colombia and South Florida that her travels are closely tracked. That’s because any buying decision by the United States’ largest retailer can single-handedly change the flow of roses on two continents. This year promised to be especially busy. Valentine’s Day falls on a Wednesday, a boon for Colombian growers, as they believe Americans are more likely to splurge on midweek sales and still count on extra purchases on the weekend before and after. Andres Osorio, managing director of Bogota-based Avianca Cargo, said he expects business to be up 7 percent from 2017, and the airline he works for added new warehouse space in Miami to make room for 12 daily flower flights. But long before they are loaded onto Osorio’s planes or sold in Walmart’s stores, they are “pinched” from their stems by someone like Romulo Castro, who uses a two-second snip to set the whole process in motion. Inside a steamy greenhouse here on the outskirts of Bogota, Castro, 57, was dwarfed inside a giant rose bed, surrounded by tens of thousands of bright red roses. He is wearing two hats: a baseball cap to hold his hair tight against his head and a wide-brimmed floppy hat to protect his neck from the near-equatorial sun. He eyeballs a stem, cuts it 25 inches below its red top, and places the flower in a basket. Step left, scissors open, snip again. He’s one of 850 workers at the Flores de Serrezuela farm, roughly 20 miles west of Bogota. Every time Castro places a rose in his basket, it enters an integrated supply chain that, through a mix of high-end technology and a few anachronistic touches, gets the flowers from beds outside Bogota to U.S. retailers in a matter of days — often faster than flower growers in California can get their products to East Coast markets. TOP: Workers process roses in a flower facility in Tocancipa, Colombia. The region has long, sunny days, high elevation and plenty of cheap labor, which makes it perfect for growing flowers. ABOVE LEFT: Roses grown at the Ayura farm in Tocancipa, Colombia, add to Colombia‘s gigantic role in global floriculture. The country exports more than 6 billion stems each year to a total of 90 countries. ABOVE RIGHT: Jose A. Restrepo of flower producer Ayura gives a tour of the property on a horse-drawn carriage last month in Tocancipa, Colombia. Bunches destined for Miami are wrapped in clear plastic. Flowers going to Canada are boxed in blue cardboard. White cardboard for the flowers going to Japan, and green-and-yellow cardboard containers for the flowers going to Russia. Once they are boxed, they are moved into a giant refrigeration room. They will probably stay in below-40-degree temperatures until they are sold in their final destination. Here at Serrezuela, the women wear green uniforms, and on the back it says “Nuestra Gente Florece,” which means “Our People Flourish.” There are 130,000 Colombians working in floriculture, and it exports more than 6 billion stems each year to a total of 90 countries. The process is overseen by Ricardo Samper, 38, a second-generation flower grower who graduated from Boston University and has an MBA from Northwestern University. He made the decision several years ago to diversify the client base beyond just the United States and to target buyers in Japan and elsewhere, where profit margins are higher, but Valentine’s Day is still his peak. “I’m sold out,” he said, standing in the post-harvest room and surveying his holiday rose and carnation inventory. “I’ve been sold out since December.” Sales of U.S.-produced roses have declined 95 percent since the Andean Trade Preference Act passed in 1991.

Colombian drug cartels used coca plants to produce cocaine in the South American jungle. Through corruption, guile and murder, they muscled these drugs by the ton into the United States. President George H.W. Bush and other officials sought incentives that would push Colombians away from cocaine production and toward more legitimate parts of their economy, promising to open up access to U.S. consumers. So in 1991, Congress passed the Andean Trade Preference Act, a law that would lift duties on numerous exports from Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru. The roughly 6 percent import duty on Colombian roses disappeared. Still, the reminders of darker days are everywhere, both in Colombia and in Miami, where the incoming flowers are met by agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. LEFT: Boxes of flowers shipped from Bogota, Colombia, are unloaded from an Avianca Cargo plane at Miami International Airport last month. MIDDLE: Miami International Airport is a key import hub for the Colombian flower industry. In the three weeks leading up to Feb. 14, 30 cargo jets make the four-hour flight to Miami each day. RIGHT: Robert Skafidas, an agriculture specialist for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, examines flowers from an Avianca Cargo plane that arrived from Bogota, Colombia, at Miami International Airport. Inspectors once had to look out for weeds as well as drugs in the bouquets. “But that doesn‘t happen anymore,“ Skafidas said. When flowers leave farms outside Bogota, they are sealed in the back of trucks to prevent anyone from tampering with the delivery. Once they reach Miami, they are X-rayed for cocaine and other contraband. Today, the vast majority of Colombian flowers come in clean, but that wasn’t always the case. Almost all the flowers brought to Miami by Avianca are unloaded in Cargo Terminal 708, where a team of Customs and Border Protection agents is waiting around the clock to inspect a portion of each shipment. Standing beside a white table, with a magnifying glass on a chain around his neck, inspector Robert Skafidas remembers seeing much different types of flower shipments from Colombia. He said growers would sometimes use garden weeds to fill out bouquets. And many inspectors remember seeing cocaine stuffed into boxes of roses. “They would just tuck it in the bouquet,” Skafidas said. “But that doesn’t happen anymore.” Many U.S. government and industry officials say the 1991 law helped grow legitimate Colombian businesses, particularly flower farms, by connecting them with the global economy. “You can employ people who would otherwise not have jobs, and have to find something else to do,” said Mario Vicente, general manager at Fresca Farms, a Miami importer that also owns flower farms in Colombia. “I’m not going to say the drugs don’t exist, but if you take flowers out of the equation, the pressure to produce more drugs would be enormous.” Businesses wilt and grow Whether or not they dented the flow of drugs, the trade moves radically reshaped the flower market in both countries. The Colombian industry expanded access to the largest economy in the world, while U.S. growers were suddenly overwhelmed by the competition from cheap flowers. Colombian roses have a number of advantages over U.S. flowers. They grow fast and at a high altitude with the same amount of sunshine all year. The red roses many Americans will purchase this week are called Freedom roses in Colombia, a particular breed that was put into mass production around the time of the 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States. These roses are durable, bright and strong, but they have little fragrance. They also grow near a major international airport, where planes can reach Miami in less than four hours. And, importantly, labor costs are low. The minimum wage in Colombia is around $300 a month. In the first three months of 1992, Colombian roses were selling to U.S. wholesalers for an average of 24 cents per stem, according to a 1995 report from the U.S. International Trade Commission. The wholesale price of U.S.-grown roses remained trapped at around 35 cents a stem from 1986 until 2006, according to U.S. Agriculture Department data. It has ticked up in recent years because U.S. growers have focused primarily on higher-end roses that are designed for weddings and special events. The 1991 law gave Colombia a cheap way to send flowers, but the law needed to be renewed every few years. Meanwhile, U.S. flower growers tried to persuade lawmakers to jack up import duties on Colombian roses because U.S. greenhouses couldn’t compete with the imports. But in 2012, the duty-free rose agreement was permanently fortified after Congress passed the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement. The pact rolled back import fees on Colombian flowers, while allowing U.S. companies to export products such as corn, soybean, wheat and oil to Colombia without paying any tariffs. A wave of U.S. growers abandoned roses. In 1986, there were 228 domestic growers producing just one type of rose — the hybrid tea rose — for mass consumption. By 2015, the number of U.S. producers selling any type of rose at a large scale had dwindled to 15. In the years following the ATPA, rose imports from Colombia increased while U.S. production fell. 600m −7.5% 500m +33.4% 400m 300m 1991 1993 Source: U.S. International Trade Commission report, March 1995 THE WASHINGTON POST Euphoria Flowers, a sixth-generation family rose farm in California, for the first time stopped producing extra roses for Valentine’s Day in 2017. Company officials decided they couldn’t compete with imports, and they now focus instead on growing flowers for weddings and events. Others gave up years ago: In 2002, Rene Van Wingerden, a California grower with Ocean Breeze Farms, spent $3 million to purchase 150,000 rose plants. His plan was to compete with the South American importers, convinced that he could make the business work. “My philosophy was, ‘Eh, we can beat them,’” he said. But after three years, when he found that he was selling each rose for 3 cents less than it cost to produce, Van Wingerden gave up and focused on other flowers that he said weren’t imported by the ton from Colombia. “What we’re challenged by is Colombia as the low-cost provider, and it’s the reason we don’t have many rose farmers in the United States today,” said Kasey Cronquist, chief executive of the California Cut Flower Commission. Cronquist has a led push for tougher restrictions on Colombian exports. “It’s a machine, and it’s built on influence and the ability to drive the market.” He has said the United States could impose new restrictions on Colombian flowers, such as taxes or duties, to take away some of the price advantage that foreign growers enjoy. But even as Colombian roses have beaten back the U.S. industry, they’ve created new jobs as well. At USA Bouquet Company in Doral, Fla., 75 workers are crowded in one section of the room, putting imported red roses into vases and then carefully packing them in boxes for a Valentine’s shipment to Walgreens. The roses that come in from Colombia ready to be quickly packaged and sold are referred to as “chop and plops,” flowers that need their stems recut but no other changes. Other flowers need to be assorted into specific bouquets to meet orders for supermarkets, online retailers or anyone else who locked in a contract with the company. The room is around 40 degrees, cold enough to keep the flowers dormant but not so cold that employees will quit. The production floor can pack up 1,200 cases of flowers each hour, with 10 bouquets in every case, a dozen flowers in every bouquet, for a 16-hour workday. There are dozens of similar warehouses within 20 miles of USA Bouquet. In the weeks running up to Valentine’s Day, many of them run around the clock, rushing to pack and ship flowers before the next truck arrives. “Colombia relies on this, right here,” said Scott Hill, vice president of sales and marketing. “This is their market.” ‘The consumption habits of the market’ Most Americans used to buy bouquets of roses from florists. But now the majority of flowers are sold in supermarkets, online retailers and places like Walmart, creating mass demand for a supply-chain-style business model that Colombia has raced to provide. This model and the wave of Colombian roses have kept the price of these flowers at almost the same level for decades. They are often more expensive around Valentine’s Day, but Americans can often still buy a bouquet of a dozen red roses this week for less than $20. That means each Freedom rose can make a journey of several thousand miles at around $1.50 a stem, with multiple businesses claiming a profit of several dimes off each flower. The growers, importers, bouquet assemblers and retailers have learned the way to make money off roses is by selling hundreds of millions of them within a three-week window. In the end, the flowers still come in at the low price and large volume that consumers demand, something U.S. growers complain they are unable to match. The free-trade agreement and other U.S. incentives have nurtured Colombia’s role in this process, Avianca Cargo’s Osorio said, but perhaps nothing has been as important as the American appetite for affordable roses. “It’s been helping for years,” Osorio said of the U.S. trade decisions. “There are certain incentives that make it easier for the growers, but it’s also the consumption habits of the market.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
118,"Precious as Silver, Vanilla Brings Cash and Crime to Madagascar","With prices reaching hundreds of dollars a pound, Madagascar’s vanilla-growing region is in the midst of an economic boom. The windfall, however, has come at a steep cost.",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/30/world/africa/madagascar-vanilla.html,2018-08-30T09:07:14Z,"SAMBAVA, Madagascar — Bright moonlight reflected off broad banana leaves, but it was still hard to see the blue twine laced through the undergrowth, a tripwire meant to send the unwary tumbling to the ground. “This is the way the thieves come,” said the vanilla farmer, lowering his voice and sweeping his flashlight beam over a ditch. Sambava Antsahalalina Madagascar By The New York Times Each night the farmer, Ninot Oclin, 33, patrols his land in the foothills of a volcano in Madagascar, barefoot, with a bolt-action rifle slung over his shoulder. If he hears someone fall, he knows yet another bandit is trying to steal his lucrative crop of ripening vanilla. The lush mountains in Madagascar’s northeast produce about 80 percent of the world’s vanilla, one of the most expensive flavors. Its price has soared, reaching more than $600 a kilogram last year, or about $270 a pound — more than silver — compared with $50 a kilogram in 2013. Growing Western demand for the flavoring is partly driving the price spike, with vanilla used in everything from ice cream to alcohol to cosmetics. Supply was diminished by a cyclone that ravaged crops last year on the island, which lies off the coast of southeast Africa. With the perfect climate and soil for growing vanilla, the Sava region of Madagascar is in the midst of an economic boom. So-called vanilla mansions have sprung up above traditional thatched grass huts. Even the humblest homes often boast solar panels and LED lights that make once-dark villages glow by night. Gleaming SUVs ply the broken streets of Sambava, the vanilla capital, where bustling markets line the roadsides. The windfall, however, has come at a cost. Vanilla’s high price, combined with rampant poverty and a corrupt, weak state, has made the crop a favorite target of violent criminal networks. The story of the vanilla trade in Madagascar is one of dangers and rewards, and can be told through three vital links in the chain that delivers the flavor from the fields to port, where it is exported to the world. Most vanilla still comes from small farms, like Mr. Oclin’s, where the work is backbreaking. Vanilla plants need to be nurtured for three to four years before bearing pods. The flowers bloom once a year for 24 hours and must be immediately pollinated. Melipona bees in Mexico, where the Aztecs first used vanilla, originally did this job, but the insects never existed in Madagascar. So each season, about 40 million vanilla plants are fertilized by hand using a toothpick-sized wooden needle. Once pollinated, a flower produces green beans within two months; the vanilla fragrance is tucked inside in thousands of little black seeds and an oily film. The beans begin fermenting once picked, so growers must quickly find buyers. The hard work does not bother Mr. Oclin. “The problem is security,” he said, explaining that thieves will attack and kill farmers for their vanilla pods. So not only does he patrol his plot of about 3,000 vanilla vines, he pays three men to stand guard every night during the four months before the summer harvest. The men are armed with double-pronged fishing spears and clubs, plus Mr. Oclin’s rifle. Each night, a vigilante group patrolling local plantations stops by with a half-dozen men armed with clubs and machetes. “Every vanilla plot will be guarded,” Mr. Oclin said. With little public trust in a corrupt police force and justice system, mob justice often prevails when a suspected thief is caught. In April, a local militia captured a thief with a little over three pounds of freshly picked vanilla. He was beaten with sticks until he collapsed, then hacked to death with machetes, according to residents. It was just one of dozens of similar “vanilla murders” over the past two seasons. But arrests do happen. On one day this year, “we had 33 convictions,” said Volozara Sakina Mohamady, the director of the prison in Antalaha, one of the Sava region’s main ports. “Mostly for vanilla.” Despite the risks, Mr. Oclin has seen a small payoff from the vanilla trade. He now has a smartphone and a Facebook account, and his one-room home has a TV and satellite dish powered by solar energy. In Sambava, in the shade of a mango tree, Pascale Rasafindakoto, 44, a “commisionnaire,” or middleman, waits with dozens of his peers for lower-level sellers to arrive from the countryside with small plastic bags of vanilla beans. The aroma, texture, and bean size (bigger is better) are examined and a price negotiated. Sometimes, Mr. Rasafindakoto ventures into the countryside in a battered car in search of deals. His trip back might include a forced stop at one of the frequent roadblocks, where the police expect a payoff to pass. “I’ve never had any problems with gendarmes,” he said smiling. “I work with them. I have to give them something so they are my friends.” With beans spoiling so quickly, growers have little bargaining power. They often get much less money for their beans than middlemen like Mr. Rasafindakoto receive when selling the beans to a central curing facility. “We’ve been poor for too long,” said Dominique Rakotoson, 55, a longtime farmer in Sambava who represents 100 families of vanilla growers. “Despite the price hike, most farmers remain poor because they sell their crops right away, or too early.” Tales of commissionaires swindling growers abound. They also are widely accused of lowering overall quality by mixing good and bad vanilla. “The middlemen is where the shady business goes on,” Mr. Rakotoson said. Mr. Rasafindakoto shrugs off talk like this. His family now has a new house with a flat screen TV and makes frequent trips to the beach to barbecue with friends. The vanilla trade is hard work, he said, so why not enjoy the good times while they last? “With vanilla, life is sweet,” Mr. Rasafindakoto said. “It has sped up and we can live it fully.” Michel Lomone presided over his warehouse in Antalaha, watching a small army of aproned women curing, sorting and packing tons of vanilla into boxes for export. While wealthy by local standards, Mr. Lomone’s biggest concern is the same as Mr. Oclin’s: theft. “There is no security of goods or of people,” Mr. Lomone said. “The system of justice is rotten. There’s total impunity. It’s like cocaine in Latin America. They get the little guys, but not the head.” Mr. Lomone said hundreds of pounds of vanilla have been stolen from his warehouses over the years. All his employees are frisked when they leave work. “The pods are so small and valuable it’s easy to hide them,” he said. “It’s like with diamonds in South Africa.” Mr. Lomone produces the highest quality “bourbon” vanilla, using a curing technique that takes months. “Vanilla takes patience,” Mr. Lomone said. This year, with supply less affected by bad weather, the price may dip, but vanilla’s worth is expected to stay far above historical norms. Mr. Lomone said he was concerned about the boom’s effect on local culture, with people doing whatever they can to get rich quick. “Now in Madagascar, it’s not a problem of poverty to eat, but of social poverty,” he said. “It’s about the competition to keep up with others making fast money. It’s not good. We can’t keep going like this.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
119,"In Kenya, struggling potato growers ink a new deal","By Kagondu NjagiKIPIPIRI, Kenya (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Sitting on a rickety bench at his home in Kipipiri, in central Kenya, Samuel Macharia pulls a piece of paper from his pocket and proudly points to the signature at the bottom.""This paper means I g…",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-farming-weather/in-kenya-struggling-potato-growers-ink-a-new-deal-idUSKBN1EX04Z,2018-01-08T02:46:22Z,"KIPIPIRI, Kenya (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Sitting on a rickety bench at his home in Kipipiri, in central Kenya, Samuel Macharia pulls a piece of paper from his pocket and proudly points to the signature at the bottom. “This paper means I get paid on time for my potatoes, even when the weather is bad,” he said. The precious document is a farming contract Macharia signed in March with the East African Potato Consortium. It says he will sell at least two tonnes of potatoes to food processors each harvesting season for the next two years. “Thanks to this contract I can earn up to 22,000 Kenyan shillings ($213) per season,” he said. Recurring drought and sudden cold spells have affected the quality of potatoes and other staples across Kenya. Peris Mukami, a farmer from Timau village, in Meru County, said her potato yields had declined by over 10 percent in the past two years because “it is either too cold or too hot”. “The cold damages potato vines with frostbite while heat makes them wilt,” she explained. To try to fight back, Kenyan potato farmers such as Macharia are increasingly turning to production contracts with food processors – a system known as contract farming – through the East African Potato Consortium. By working with the consortium, they get access to seeds that better stand up to harsher conditions, as well as better fertilisers. They also get a guaranteed price for their crop, as long as they produce good-quality potatoes on time, said Wachira Kaguongo, head of the National Potato Council. FAIR DEALS The consortium, which was set up in 2016 by the National Potato Council, the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa and the Grow Africa partnership, aims to increase private investment in agriculture by linking potato farmers with food processors across the country, Kaguongo said. Each production agreement is reviewed and approved by the National Potato Council, which ensures it is fair to both parties, said Willy Bett, cabinet secretary of the Kenyan Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries. “Businessmen will always want to get farmers to sign something that may not be favorable to them,” Bett told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “We’re trying to prevent that by ensuring that farming activity is done on a contract basis in Kenya.” Contract farming has allowed farmers to sell produce to food giants such as the fast-food chain KFC, formerly known as Kentucky Fried Chicken. Macharia’s potatoes now fetch 22 shillings ($0.20) per kilo, more than double what he used to get when selling them at the Kipipiri open air market. “I am paid in cash at my farm,” he said. “And I do not have to travel to the market when I don’t want to.” So far 5,000 farmers have signed up to the system, with a total of 23,000 expected to have made the switch by 2020, said Kaguongo. SUPPLY SHORTAGE? Felix Matheri, a researcher at the International Center of Insect Physiology and Ecology, said that while contract farming provides farmers with a steady income, it risks depriving poor families of their food supply. “Contracts bind farmers to supplying an agreed amount of potatoes, meaning that when the harvest is low farmers are forced to sell all their produce to meet their obligations,” he explained. “But potatoes are rich in starch and a critical source of nutrients – farmers should save some for home consumption,” he said. Others have concerns about contract farming as well. Louise Wangari, a roadside seller of potatoes in Nyandarua County, said she is worried it might affect the supply she gets from farmers. “The quantity of potatoes I was getting from farmers was already decreasing due to extreme weather,” she said. “If they start signing contracts with other buyers, then I may be out of business soon, as I can’t afford to pay them as much as the food processors.” Reporting by Kagondu Njagi, Editing by Zoe Tabary and Laurie Goering.

120,Coffee faces a double threat to its existence in eastern Ethiopia,"For generations, farmers planted the lush earth of Awedai and nearby areas in eastern Ethiopia with coffee trees, earning a livelihood from a crop that is now the country's main export.",https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1IA22J-OZATP,2018-05-09T13:35:40Z,"HARAR, Ethiopia (Reuters) - For generations, farmers planted the lush earth of Awedai and nearby areas in eastern Ethiopia with coffee trees, earning a livelihood from a crop that is now the country’s main export. But the centuries-long practice is now being abandoned in favour of khat, a leafy plant chewed as a stimulant in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. “Coffee comes only once a year. But you can harvest khat twice a year,” said Jemal Moussa, a 45-year-old farmer and father of six who depends on the narcotic leaf for income. “Khat is much more useful.” He said it was in the early 2000s that farmers in the Awedai area started planting khat as its popularity rose and coffee prices remained stagnant. One kg of coffee sells for between 50 and 60 birr. A bunch of khat, while not measured in kilograms, goes for 100 birr. Jemal said by this year, the entire economy of Awedai, a small town 35 km outside the ancient city of Harar, relied on the leaf. Trucks piled with khat head out of the town every 30 minutes, dispersing their produce to the nearby Ethiopian Somali Region and Hargeisa, in the neighbouring semi-autonomous region of Somaliland. Illegal in several Western nations, the leaf is immensely popular in the region, giving the chewer a mild amphetamine-like high. In addition to cash incentive of khat, coffee growing is being affected by dwindling forest coverage as well as drought. Farmers believe the characteristic flavour of Ethiopian coffee is derived from growing it in the shade of larger trees - leaving it vulnerable if trees are stunted or removed. And in 2015/16, a drought induced by the El Nino phenomenon - the warming of surface sea temperatures in the Pacific - ravaged the country’s east, before below average autumn rains in the southern and southeastern parts of the country led to a new drought in lowland pastoralist areas the following year. Indeed, some 5.6 million people required emergency food assistance in the country in 2017. “The harvesting is already delayed by three and a half weeks. By now we would have processed 85-plus percent. But now we have not even picked that much as you can see,” said Aman Adinew, chief executive of Metad Agricultural Development, which processes coffee in Yirgacheffe in southern Ethiopia. Yirgacheffe is one of the best known coffee brands for Africa’s biggest producer of the bean. “The coffee is still green on the tree - it needs rain to turn red. We are hoping it comes soon,” said Aman. “But if this trend continues, it is going to adversely impact the farmers and businessmen like us the growers like us and the country.” While coffee is heavily dependent on rain, Khat needs less, making it a more attractive option for some farmers.

121,North Carolina residents win big money from Smithfield,Crunch time on NAFTA 2.0 talks — Conaway’s farm bill amendment plan — Perdue OKs transfer of non-infectious animal virus,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-agriculture/2018/04/27/north-carolina-residents-win-big-money-from-smithfield-189694,2018-04-27T14:00:55Z,"With Liz Crampton, Helena Bottemiller Evich, John Lauinger and Maya Parthasarathy N.C. RESIDENTS WIN BIG MONEY FROM SMITHFIELD: A federal jury on Thursday handed a verdict worth more than $50 million to ten North Carolina plaintiffs who live near a hog farm contracted by Smithfield. They had charged that the industrial-scale operation tarnished their quality of life by exposing them to putrid manure smells, buzzards, swarms of flies and a steady stream of trucks laden with dead animals. The verdict could expose Smithfield to millions more in payouts related to other pending cases and also has the potential to force changes to how industrial farms operate. That could also have economic ramifications in North Carolina, where hog farming is a pillar of the state economy and total output ranks second only to Iowa, the pork-producing capital of the country. Story Continued Below Cash breakdown: Each of the plaintiffs was awarded $75,000 in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages. But North Carolina statute says punitive damages must be limited to three times the amount of compensatory damages, which would shake out to $225,000 per person. Get ready for the appeal: Smithfield has vowed to appeal the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. It took the jury two days to reach its decision after hearing three weeks of testimony. The trial was the first of several dozen cases: About 500 residents sued Murphy-Brown, a subsidiary of Smithfield, in 2014 for what they say was the company’s refusal to invest in an alternative waste-disposal method that costs more but would have minimized odors emanating from Kinlaw Farm. The proceedings were seen as a bellwether for the remaining cases, which are scheduled to be heard throughout the rest of the year, Pro Ag’s Liz Crampton reports. Grounds for appeal: Smithfield has already indicated how it might make its case to the appellate court, saying it believes the verdict would have been different if the judge had allowed the jury to visit the farm and hear testimony from an expert about odor testing. Another possible argument is for Murphy-Brown to contend that it didn’t have sufficient control over the operators of Kinlaw Farm, who were not named as defendants, to be held liable for damages, said Clayton Bailey, an attorney in Texas who was not involved with the case but has experience representing agricultural companies. ‘Piggybacking’ on a pig trial? There may be an uptick in related nuisance cases because of this verdict, Bailey said. “Somebody will look at this and say: ‘These folks won, let’s see how they did it,’ and they’ll try to piggyback and bring one somewhere else,” he said. “It could be against Smithfield; it could be against someone else; it could be in a different industry — it could be in the cattle industry.” HAPPY FRIDAY, APRIL 27!

NAFTA 2.0 CRUNCH TIME HAS ARRIVED: The U.S., Mexico and Canada could soon have a successfully renegotiated NAFTA, Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray signaled on Thursday night. At the conclusion of a trilateral meeting between the NAFTA nations’ top trade leaders, Videgaray said a NAFTA 2.0 deal is “certainly possible” in the coming days. Negotiators have been meeting consistently in Washington, D.C., over the last month, as the pressure has built for them to produce a breakthrough agreement by early May, which would likely give the Trump administration just enough time to get it through Congress this year. “We’re working on it. But we’re more concerned with having a good agreement than a quick agreement,” Videgaray said. “I think we are reasonably close.” ‘Progress’ was the buzzword: Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland was also optimistic on Thursday night, emphasizing that there has been “good progress this week.” Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo, who has led Mexico’s efforts since the renegotiation launched in August 2017, offered a more muted take on where things stand. “There is always progress. The point is if it’s enough progress to be really in the point you want to be — at the point where you can say, ‘Well, we finished,’” he said. “We are still in the process and we’ll keep on moving in the right direction.” One-track mind: Ministerial-level meetings in recent weeks have almost exclusively focused on rules governing auto manufacturing in the region, an issue that Freeland has said is “at the heart of the negotiation” for all three countries. Timeline remains unclear: Ministers will meet again this morning. However, Freeland and Guajardo would not confirm whether talks will continue over the weekend, saying they are taking things day by day. More from your host here. CONAWAY’S FARM BILL AMENDMENT PLAN : House Agriculture Chairman Mike Conaway on Thursday expressed confidence that he can get a farm bill passed in the House during the week of May 14, and offered a window into how he plans to thwart so-called poison pill amendments that could sink the legislation. The Texas Republican, during an interview on the radio show “Adams on Agriculture,” said he expects a debate rule that would allow only lawmakers who plan to vote for the bill, H.R. 2 (115), to offer amendments. “If you’re going to be a ‘no’ on final, and it sounds like [ranking member Collin] Peterson’s already made his mind up, then … he’s probably not getting an amendment through the rules just to make things worse, put a poison pill amendment in,” Conaway said. Changes to SNAP, one way or another? Asked if there is a possibility that a farm bill that is conferenced between the House and Senate won’t include reforms to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Conaway replied no: There will be some changes to the food stamp program, he said, but acknowledged that they may not go as far as what was proposed in the House measure. “I’m going to get this bill across the House floor because it is just good policy. We didn’t come at this and try to cut spending... We came at it the right way, with the right heart. We’re trying to help people get off these programs, get their lives back under their own control, and who’s against that?” he said. Swaying the opposition? Conaway met with AARP on Wednesday in an effort to build support for the bill’s proposed changes to SNAP, which include stricter work requirements for between 5 million and 7 million Americans, tightened eligibility standards, and a significant investment to expand education and training programs. “They came out of that meeting scratching their heads as to why they were so vehemently against the bill when they found out that we don’t hurt seniors in our proposal,” Conaway said, adding: “They’ve had second thoughts as they understood what we’re actually doing and that they were misled.” Joyce Rogers, AARP’s senior vice president of government affairs, told MA that the organization continues to have “deep concerns about the negative impacts that the proposed changes to SNAP would have” on its 43 million recipients. AARP strongly opposes expanding work requirements, Rogers said, particularly for people ages 50 to 59 who often take longer to secure employment. Shots fired at CBPP: Conaway also said during the interview that the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, is opposed to the nutrition title because it “goes after their cash cow.” His point was that the organization helps California and Illinois gain approval from USDA to waive time limits on SNAP benefits for able-bodied adults without dependents who aren’t working. States can request to temporarily waive that time limit when unemployment is high or when there are not enough jobs available. Currently, 36 states have waivers in place either statewide or in certain areas. CBPP President Bob Greenstein refuted Conaway’s accusations in a statement to MA. He said the organization provides technical assistance to both Democrat- and Republican-led states at their request to determine which areas are eligible for time-limit waivers. “The Center does not accept a single dollar from any government for this or any other work. We’ve been critical of Chairman Conaway’s SNAP proposals because we believe they are unsound and would increase hunger and hardship. The public deserves a robust debate on these issues without policymakers hurling scurrilous claims against those who have an honest disagreement with them,” Greenstein said. ** A message from the Alliance for Fair Sugar Policy: We believe farmers and families depending on food manufacturing workers should be central to this country’s ongoing conversation on agriculture policy.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue authorized transfer of the virus, which has been genetically modified so it presents no risk of being transmitted to livestock. The added protection allows FMD vaccine development to take place within the U.S. instead of overseas, so USDA can source things more quickly in the event of an outbreak, the department said. “With this announcement, vaccine companies may now apply for USDA permits to continue their work with this specific modified, non-infectious FMD virus in the United States,” APHIS said. “All permits granted would include appropriate biocontainment and use restrictions, and may be revoked if warranted.” ROW CROPS: — Feds green-light first GMO fish farm in U.S. — with a catch: The FDA has given the go-ahead for AquaBounty to raise genetically engineered AquAdvantage salmon at an Indiana facility. It’s a big move for the GMO salmon, long caught in regulatory limbo, but the company remains prohibited from importing the eggs necessary for producing salmon due to an appropriations rider. More from FDA on its decision here. — Latest dicamba decision: The Arkansas Supreme Court on Wednesday halted a pair of temporary restraining orders issued in lower courts that exempted certain farmers from the Arkansas Plant Board’s ban on the herbicide dicamba, which took effect last week, The Associated Press reported. Two circuit court judges had ruled the ban didn’t apply to select groups of farmers who had challenged it, but the state Supreme Court struck down those orders until a full hearing on the merits can be heard in coming months. — FDA asked to dub eggs ‘healthy’: Pete and Gerry's Organic Eggs, a leading organic egg producer, is petitioning FDA to update the definition of “healthy” in its food labeling rules so that the term can be used for eggs. — Key moments from Pruitt’s Hill double-header: EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt argued during back-to-back House committee hearings on Thursday that his critics were simply attempting to undercut the “transformational change” he’s making at the agency on behalf of President Donald Trump. Our POLITICO colleagues break down the important points from his testimony. — Perdue’s liaison to the Hill clears the Hill: Ken Barbic, nominated by President Trump in January to be USDA assistant secretary for congressional relations, was confirmed by voice vote on Thursday — just in time for the farm bill reauthorization, Helena reports. Secretary Perdue said in response to the Senate’s action that Barbic, who most recently served as a senior director for the Western Growers Association, “will bring a combination of an agricultural background and legislative expertise to create a free-flowing dialogue and exchange of information with lawmakers.” — Ag coalition urges House to protect crop insurance: More than 65 groups representing crop insurance companies, bankers, farmers and state agriculture agencies sent a letter to House lawmakers on Thursday requesting that they oppose controversial changes to the crop insurance program. Specifically, the coalition is concerned about amendments to the farm bill that would limit who can participate and potentially make premiums more expensive for producers during a time of low commodity prices. The letter also said private-sector delivery shouldn’t be harmed. Read it here. — Pruitt confirms number of RFS waiver requests: EPA received 24 waiver petitions in 2016 for small refineries to get out of their Renewable Fuel Standard requirements, and more than 30 applications for the 2017 compliance year, Pruitt told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Thursday. It marked the first time the agency has confirmed the number. Pro Energy’s Eric Wolff has more. — GAO’s cost-saving recommendations for ag: The Government Accountability Office released a report on Thursday that highlighted nine actions related to agricultural programs that USDA or Congress could take to limit waste in government. One of those recommendations was for Congress to repeal the provision in the 2014 farm bill that blocks USDA, in its standards reinsurance agreement with companies selling crop insurance, from reducing their underwriting gains.

122,Where did you get your tree?

But in one of Georgia’s poorest regions, child climbers risk their lives to harvest seeds to grow the Nordmann fir, Europe’s most popular Christmas tree thanks to its scent, dark green needles and even profile, say campaigners and residents. Children as young as 10 climb trees that can reach 50 metres (165 ft) in height in northern Georgia’s Ambrolauri Forest, where most Nordmann seeds originate, to collect cones. “I know that children are climbing. Parents come to me and ask me in September to let their children miss lessons because they are helping their fathers in the forest to collect cones,” Marina Gociridze, head teacher of a local village school. “They are competing with each other who climbed higher and who collected more cones,” she said by phone from the small village of Tlugi in Georgia’s Racha-Lechkhumi region in the foothills of the towering Caucasus mountains. The annual harvest season in September is a massive boon for the residents of Tlugi and nearby villages, attracting several hundred workers each year. Seeds are then extracted from the cones and exported to growers and nurseries, where they will take 11 years to reach maturity. Growers sell directly to consumers or supply retailers ranging from small growers to big garden centre chains. In Britain, Nordmann Firs can cost from 40 pounds to more than 100 pounds ($55 to $135). Ambrolauri Forest is divided into plots, which the government licenses to private companies, who employ contractors for harvesting. But in practice, local people, driven by poverty, often ignore the licensing arrangement and collect cones throughout the forest, selling them in bulk to middlemen for just 1 lari (40 cents) per kilo, said Gociridze. POOR SAFETY The lines between regulated and unregulated picking are often blurred, as buying and selling by middlemen obscures the provenance of cones, according to locals in the industry. Climbers often forego ropes and safety harnesses, which obstruct and slow movement between branches, said several people who have witnessed the practice. “These guys climb the trees like monkeys,” said Adrian Morgan, owner of Snowbird Christmas Trees, one of the UK’s largest Christmas tree nurseries, who has visited the forest to source seeds from a licensed Georgian partner. Officials from Georgia’s National Forestry Agency did not respond to requests for comments by phone and email. “The government must... make investors obliged to make better working conditions for those people who risk their lives,” said Rati Namgaladze, former mayor of the historic city of Ambrolauri, just outside the forest. Namgaladze’s brother died while attempting to jump between trees in 1994, leaving behind a wife and two-year-old daughter. License holding companies have improved safety standards since his brother’s death, he said, but said locals still collect in a “chaotic” way, and are poorly paid by middlemen. Deaths were common in the 1990s, when Georgia’s post-Soviet economy collapsed, and the most recent fatality was in 2012, according to the founder of Fair Trees, which sells about 30,000 Christmas trees each year in Germany and Denmark. Established by Danish campaigner and grower Marianne Bols in 2009, Fair Trees provides its staff in Ambrolauri with training, safety equipment and a per kilo price of around 5 lari ($2), four to five times the going rate, Bols said. “No one can imagine how poor people are and under which unacceptable conditions people live,” Bols told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “(There are) no sewerage systems in the villages. Toilets are a hole in the ground.” A small surcharge on each tree sold by Fair Trees goes to sponsor students and a free dental clinic for children. One, a 12-year-old, told Bols on a visit in September he had been climbing trees for two years with his family, she said. Other European buyers have yet to follow their lead, Bols said, and the tradition of child tree climbers looks set to continue. ""These children are so proud,"" said headteacher Gociridze. ""They are making Christmas for the children of Europe."" (Reporting by Ruairi Casey; Editing by Ros Russell.

123,FEATURE-Chocolate forests: Can cocoa help restore the Amazon?,"For years, Valdomiro Facchi has made a living ranching on land carved from the Amazon rainforest. He's a small player in one of the world's biggest environmental disasters.",https://uk.reuters.com/article/brazil-cocoa-environment/feature-chocolate-forests-can-cocoa-help-restore-the-amazon-idUKL1N1RP016,2018-04-12T05:00:00Z,"NEW YORK/MEDICILÂNDIA, Brazil, April 12 (Reuters) - For years, Valdomiro Facchi has made a living ranching on land carved from the Amazon rainforest. He’s a small player in one of the world’s biggest environmental disasters. But now that his cattle have trampled the pastures to dust - and new laws prevent him from clearing fresh land - he has to find new income. “I want to diversify,” said the 68-year old rancher, outlining plans to plant cocoa trees on his 300 hectare plot in Brazil’s Para State. “I want to have the cocoa income when profit from cattle ranching fails.” Facchi illustrates a trend that is turning damaged parts of the Amazon basin green again and creating an usual alliance between the agriculture industry and conservationists. Brazil’s cattle ranchers are planting cocoa on their used-up pasture, with financial support from international environmental groups. That’s a big change. For decades, ranchers have been the engine of clear-cutting in the Amazon rainforest that has rendered an area nearly the size of Spain treeless. Environmentalists have argued the practice destroys wildlife habitat and undermines the planet’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide that causes global warming. “Besides being a means of avoiding deforestation, cocoa plantations favor the local, regional and national economy,” the international environmental group The Nature Conservancy said on its website. The young trees will also bring change to global cocoa markets. Brazil’s National Association of the Cocoa Processing Industry (AIPC) expects the surge in planting to help double the country’s output of the raw material in chocolate by 2028 to 400,000 tonnes a year. That increase would raise global output by about 5 percent. The renewed planting could make Brazil one of the world’s top three cocoa growers again after the sector was decimated in the 1990s by a crop fungus called witches’ broom. (For a graphic on global cocoa production and chocolate consumption, see: tmsnrt.rs/2GzYPF0 ) Conservationists and cocoa industry representatives expect the trend to help mitigate the effects of clear-cutting that has ripped some 430,000 square kilometers from the Amazon rain forest since the 1980s. Fifty percent of cocoa production growth will come from the Amazon, said Eduardo Bastos, executive director of the AIPC, calling the cocoa farms there “chocolate forests.” Green groups like The Nature Conservancy and the Amazon Fund have helped finance new cocoa plantations. The Amazon Fund - which was set up by Brazil’s government and takes international donations to combat deforestation - has poured 17 million reais ($5.09 million) in grants into the crop. Nearly 1,700 square kilometers of degraded cattle pasture in Brazil has been transformed into cocoa plantations already, according to the AIPC’s Bastos. ECONOMIC INCENTIVES Cocoa planting is driven mainly by new limits on the cattle industry that have changed the financial incentives for ranchers. In the Amazon, pasture can become degraded in as little as three years if not managed properly, making it hard to raise a thriving herd without new acreage. Brazil in 2014 passed a law that allows landowners to clear only 20 percent of their property in the Amazon and requires some landowners to replant depleted areas. That law aims to curb deforestation, which peaked in 2004 at a pace of 27,000 square km per year. In 2017, Brazilian Amazon lost 6,624 square km of rainforest. Compared to ranching, cocoa can provide income from a relatively small plot with no need for constant expansion. The profits can be up to five times better, said Eduardo Trevisan Gonçalves, project manager at Brazil’s Imaflora, an environmental group that did a study comparing income from cattle and cocoa in the region. The benefits extend to the environment. Cocoa plantations can imitate natural forests, helping to restore native plant and wildlife species, boosting water resources and absorbing carbon dioxide, Goncalves said. “It is a perennial crop,” he said. “It will stay there for decades.” Funding from environmental groups comes with guidelines intended to boost the ecological benefits of the plantations, according to José Garcia, a farmer in the central Pará state who is receiving a grant from the Amazon Fund. Under the terms, he said, he will have to plant cocoa alongside other taller native species, such as mahogany and ipê. “It is recommended that cocoa be planted with other trees - taller ones - to benefit from the shade,” he said at his farm in Medicilândia in Para State. ‘WE BUY COCOA’ Evidence of the shift is everywhere in the Medicilândia region, where barren pastures have given way to shady plantations of cocoa trees bearing yellow and ruby pods, the fibrous protective coverings for the cocoa beans. In the city of Medicilândia, a low-lying town lined with dirt roads in Para state, farmers truck bags full of dried cocoa beans to warehouses bearing signs that read “we buy cocoa.” Shops nearby offer ice-cold cocoa juice, a thick - sweet drink prepared with the fruit’s pulp. Brazil is an agricultural heavyweight, among the world’s top growers of soybeans, corn, sugar, coffee, and oranges. But it dropped from being No. 2 in cocoa in the early 1990s after witches’ broom slashed its production. In Para State, however, witches’ broom rarely survives long enough to damage trees. The fungus requires moist conditions and largely dies off during the annual dry season. As a result, cocoa tree yields in Para are nearly double the global average, said Bastos of the AIPC. There is some evidence Brazil could absorb some of this extra production: Euromonitor International pegs per capita chocolate consumption in Brazil at just 1.2 kilograms a year, compared with 8.8 kg in Switzerland, suggesting Brazil’s domestic chocolate market has room to grow. Brazil’s processing companies - which transform cocoa beans into butter, powder and chocolate - welcome the prospect of increased domestic supply to feed their factories and lower their imports, but inject a note of skepticism. Olam International’s Cocoa Vice President in Brazil, Kidambi Srinivasan, for example, called the 400,000 tonne per year target “an unlikely possibility” without higher market prices and more assistance to planters in areas including financing, training and supplies. Benchmark cocoa prices in New York are currently running at about $2,500 a tonne, having bounced off a 10-year low of $1,756 hit in 2017 on worries of global oversupply. Other big processors in Brazil include Cargill, which has an 85,000 tonne plant in Ilhéus, and Barry Callebaut, the world’s biggest maker of industrial chocolate, which opened its first South American chocolate facility in Brazil in 2010. For some of the ranchers-turned-planters, the chance to undo some of the damage to the Amazon caused by ranching is as important as the money they can earn from cocoa. “There was a time when I thought: We shouldn’t have come here,” said Elido Trevisan, who arrived in Para to ranch in 1972 and cleared nearly 100 percent of his land. “But now,” he said, “we can do something to compensate.” ($1 = 3.3372 reais) Reporting by Marcy Nicholson in New York and Marcelo Teixeira in Medicilandia, Brazil Editing by Simon Webb, Richard Valdmanis and Brian Thevenot",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For some of the ranchers-turned-planters, the chance to undo some of the damage to the Amazon caused by ranching is as important as the money they can earn from cocoa. “There was a time when I thought: We shouldn’t have come here,” said Elido Trevisan, who arrived in Para to ranch in 1972 and cleared nearly 100 percent of his land. “But now,” he said, “we can do something to compensate.” Graphic - Biggest cocoa producers and chocolate consumers: tmsnrt.rs/2GzYPF0 Reporting by Marcy Nicholson in New York and Marcelo Teixeira in Medicilandia, Brazil; Editing by Simon Webb, Richard Valdmanis and Brian Thevenot",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Life was tough for her family in Mindanao, the second largest island in the Philippines, as they struggled to earn $1,000 a year from their produce, with their coffee beans fetching only 20 cents per kilo from local traders. But Dubria is now one of hundreds of farmers nationwide who are brewing up a storm with training from Coffee For Peace (CfP) - a social enterprise striving to boost growers’ profits, protect the environment and foster peace between communities. Having learned how to grow, harvest and process high-quality Arabica beans at a time when global demand for coffee is soaring - it is set to hit a record high this year - Dubria exports her crop to buyers as far away as Seattle for at least $5 per kilo. “But it’s not all about the money - it’s about taking responsibility for the environment and other communities,” Dubria told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in her home on Mount Apo while brewing a pot of thick, aromatic, treacle-like coffee. Beyond helping coffee growers get a better deal, CfP aims to encourage dialogue between communities, with tensions ranging from colonial-era conflict between native Muslims and Christian settlers to land and resource disputes between ethnic groups. The Philippines is battling to restore order to troubled Mindanao, where militant groups have pledged allegiance to Islamic State, and five decades of communist insurgency and separatist bombings have displaced at least 2 million people. By bringing people together through trade, businesses with a social mission can help build peace, industry experts say. “Social enterprise presents an emerging pathway or approach to conflict resolution,” said Angel Flores, East Asia business head at the British Council, which backs companies seeking to help people, invest in the environment and tackle social ills. “Being inclusive, participatory and prioritising community benefit over personal agendas enhances the social fabric from a place of distrust to... confidence and mutual understanding.” “FARMERPRENEURS” CfP was set up in 2008 on the conflict-hit southern island of Mindanao, after its founders stopped Christian and Muslim neighbours going to war over the ownership of a rice field. The men were invited to put down their guns and talk over coffee, a tradition which quickly spread across the region. CfP offers a three-year scheme to train farmers to produce coffee while encouraging native and settler communities and various tribes to harvest and process the beans together. While the social enterprise buys the farmers’ beans above market value - selling them on to local coffee shops and exporting as far as Canada - communities can sell to any buyer, but are encouraged to demand higher prices. “We don’t treat them as suppliers or just part of the chain - they are farmerpreneurs,” said CfP senior vice president Twinkle Bautista. “The aim is to unite the settlers and indigenous people to teach each other, share techniques and tools... and harmony,” she added. “Our product is peace - coffee is just the tool.” For Kagawad Abe and his indigenous community, setting up a processing centre through CfP has brought them closer to the Christian settlers - who work with them to process their beans. “It has also brought women together, and given them a chance to work independently... to contribute to the tribe,” he said. About 80 percent of CfP’s coffee-growing partners are women. “Just five or so years ago, we didn’t really know each other - but now we are talking and working together,” Abe added. CfP says business is booming, having tripled sales to at least $46,000 last year from $15,000 in 2012 and won United Nations and regional awards for promoting peace and development. Although social enterprises in the Philippines have more than tripled in the last decade to 165,000, many are struggling due to limited state support and a lack of funding, said the British Council and the Philippines Social Enterprise Network. CfP’s success is likely largely due to its unusual mission, said Gerry Higgins, chief executive of Community Enterprise in Scotland (CEIS), Britain’s largest agency to support the sector. “Coffee for Peace is unusual... there aren’t many social enterprises that recognise that if a community is resilient and sustainable, (then) fewer conflicts will emerge,” Higgins said. CONQUERORS OF COFFEE By walking farmers through every step of the supply chain, CfP says they no longer see the coffee industry as “a mystery”. Once dependent on traders and big brands such as Nestle, the world’s biggest coffee maker and producer of Nescafe, farmers can now demand higher prices for better quality beans, CfP said. Yet winning communities over remains a major challenge. Some are proud of their traditional methods and reluctant to embrace change, while others are wary of civil society groups and used to instant cash or aid, rather than long-term support. “We had to convince and convince our people, many times, to move from the traditional to the technical way of doing things,” said Baby Jerlina Owok, chieftain of a native tribe which has seen their coffee beans almost double in value in recent years. Yet for women such as Owok and Dubria and their coffee cooperatives, the ambitions are much bigger than making money. Pointing at huge swathes of coffee trees covering the hills, painting once barren land vibrant shades of green, Dubria spoke about planting more to combat deforestation and soil erosion. Lastly, she said they need to share their prosperity. ""We need to encourage and help other communities to produce quality coffee,"" she said. ""We want to pull them up - to improve their standard of living - so they can experience what we have.""

126,RPT-FEATURE-Chocolate forests: Can cocoa help restore the Amazon?,"Foryears, Valdomiro Facchi has made a living ranching on landcarved from the Amazon rainforest. He's a small player in one ofthe world's biggest environmental disasters.",https://www.reuters.com/article/brazil-cocoa-environment/rpt-feature-chocolate-forests-can-cocoa-help-restore-the-amazon-idUSL1N1RP018,2018-04-12T11:00:00Z,"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Marcy Nicholson and Marcelo Teixeira NEW YORK/MEDICILÂNDIA, Brazil, April 12 (Reuters) - For years, Valdomiro Facchi has made a living ranching on land carved from the Amazon rainforest. He’s a small player in one of the world’s biggest environmental disasters. But now that his cattle have trampled the pastures to dust - and new laws prevent him from clearing fresh land - he has to find new income. “I want to diversify,” said the 68-year old rancher, outlining plans to plant cocoa trees on his 300 hectare plot in Brazil’s Para State. “I want to have the cocoa income when profit from cattle ranching fails.” Facchi illustrates a trend that is turning damaged parts of the Amazon basin green again and creating an usual alliance between the agriculture industry and conservationists. Brazil’s cattle ranchers are planting cocoa on their used-up pasture, with financial support from international environmental groups. That’s a big change. For decades, ranchers have been the engine of clear-cutting in the Amazon rainforest that has rendered an area nearly the size of Spain treeless. Environmentalists have argued the practice destroys wildlife habitat and undermines the planet’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide that causes global warming. “Besides being a means of avoiding deforestation, cocoa plantations favor the local, regional and national economy,” the international environmental group The Nature Conservancy said on its website. The young trees will also bring change to global cocoa markets. Brazil’s National Association of the Cocoa Processing Industry (AIPC) expects the surge in planting to help double the country’s output of the raw material in chocolate by 2028 to 400,000 tonnes a year. That increase would raise global output by about 5 percent. The renewed planting could make Brazil one of the world’s top three cocoa growers again after the sector was decimated in the 1990s by a crop fungus called witches’ broom. (For a graphic on global cocoa production and chocolate consumption, see: tmsnrt.rs/2GzYPF0 ) Conservationists and cocoa industry representatives expect the trend to help mitigate the effects of clear-cutting that has ripped some 430,000 square kilometers from the Amazon rain forest since the 1980s. Fifty percent of cocoa production growth will come from the Amazon, said Eduardo Bastos, executive director of the AIPC, calling the cocoa farms there “chocolate forests.” Green groups like The Nature Conservancy and the Amazon Fund have helped finance new cocoa plantations. The Amazon Fund - which was set up by Brazil’s government and takes international donations to combat deforestation - has poured 17 million reais ($5.09 million) in grants into the crop. Nearly 1,700 square kilometers of degraded cattle pasture in Brazil has been transformed into cocoa plantations already, according to the AIPC’s Bastos. ECONOMIC INCENTIVES Cocoa planting is driven mainly by new limits on the cattle industry that have changed the financial incentives for ranchers. In the Amazon, pasture can become degraded in as little as three years if not managed properly, making it hard to raise a thriving herd without new acreage. Brazil in 2014 passed a law that allows landowners to clear only 20 percent of their property in the Amazon and requires some landowners to replant depleted areas. That law aims to curb deforestation, which peaked in 2004 at a pace of 27,000 square km per year. In 2017, Brazilian Amazon lost 6,624 square km of rainforest. Compared to ranching, cocoa can provide income from a relatively small plot with no need for constant expansion. The profits can be up to five times better, said Eduardo Trevisan Gonçalves, project manager at Brazil’s Imaflora, an environmental group that did a study comparing income from cattle and cocoa in the region. The benefits extend to the environment. Cocoa plantations can imitate natural forests, helping to restore native plant and wildlife species, boosting water resources and absorbing carbon dioxide, Goncalves said. “It is a perennial crop,” he said. “It will stay there for decades.” Funding from environmental groups comes with guidelines intended to boost the ecological benefits of the plantations, according to José Garcia, a farmer in the central Pará state who is receiving a grant from the Amazon Fund. Under the terms, he said, he will have to plant cocoa alongside other taller native species, such as mahogany and ipê. “It is recommended that cocoa be planted with other trees - taller ones - to benefit from the shade,” he said at his farm in Medicilândia in Para State. ‘WE BUY COCOA’ Evidence of the shift is everywhere in the Medicilândia region, where barren pastures have given way to shady plantations of cocoa trees bearing yellow and ruby pods, the fibrous protective coverings for the cocoa beans. In the city of Medicilândia, a low-lying town lined with dirt roads in Para state, farmers truck bags full of dried cocoa beans to warehouses bearing signs that read “we buy cocoa.” Shops nearby offer ice-cold cocoa juice, a thick - sweet drink prepared with the fruit’s pulp. Brazil is an agricultural heavyweight, among the world’s top growers of soybeans, corn, sugar, coffee, and oranges. But it dropped from being No. 2 in cocoa in the early 1990s after witches’ broom slashed its production. In Para State, however, witches’ broom rarely survives long enough to damage trees. The fungus requires moist conditions and largely dies off during the annual dry season. As a result, cocoa tree yields in Para are nearly double the global average, said Bastos of the AIPC. There is some evidence Brazil could absorb some of this extra production: Euromonitor International pegs per capita chocolate consumption in Brazil at just 1.2 kilograms a year, compared with 8.8 kg in Switzerland, suggesting Brazil’s domestic chocolate market has room to grow. Brazil’s processing companies - which transform cocoa beans into butter, powder and chocolate - welcome the prospect of increased domestic supply to feed their factories and lower their imports, but inject a note of skepticism. Olam International’s Cocoa Vice President in Brazil, Kidambi Srinivasan, for example, called the 400,000 tonne per year target “an unlikely possibility” without higher market prices and more assistance to planters in areas including financing, training and supplies. Benchmark cocoa prices in New York are currently running at about $2,500 a tonne, having bounced off a 10-year low of $1,756 hit in 2017 on worries of global oversupply. Other big processors in Brazil include Cargill, which has an 85,000 tonne plant in Ilhéus, and Barry Callebaut, the world’s biggest maker of industrial chocolate, which opened its first South American chocolate facility in Brazil in 2010.

127,Special Report - Appetite for destruction: Soy boom devours Brazil's tropical savanna,"When farmer Julimar Pansera purchased land in Brazil's interior seven years ago, it was blanketed in tiers of fruit trees, twisted shrubs and the occasional palm standing tall in a thicket of undergrowth.",https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKCN1LD169,2018-08-28T11:13:36Z,"CAMPOS LINDOS, Brazil (Reuters) - When farmer Julimar Pansera purchased land in Brazil’s interior seven years ago, it was blanketed in tiers of fruit trees, twisted shrubs and the occasional palm standing tall in a thicket of undergrowth. He mowed down most of that vegetation, set it ablaze and started planting soybeans. Over the past decade, he and others in the region have deforested an area larger than South Korea. Permissive land-use policies and cheap farm acreage here have helped catapult Brazil into an agricultural superpower, the world’s largest exporter of soy, beef and chicken and a major producer of pork and corn. This area has also lured farmers and ranchers away from the Amazon jungle, whose decline has spurred a global outcry to protect it. The tradeoff, environmentalists say, is that while Brazil has slowed destruction of the renowned rainforest from its worst levels, it has put another vital ecological zone at risk: a vast tropical savanna that is home to 5 percent of species on the planet. Known as the Cerrado, this habitat lost more than 105,000 square kilometers (40,541 square miles) of native cover since 2008, according to government figures. That’s 50 percent more than the deforestation seen during the same period in the Amazon, a biome more than three times larger. Accounting for relative size, the Cerrado is disappearing nearly four times faster than the rainforest. The largest savanna in South America, the Cerrado is a vital storehouse for carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas whose rising emissions from fossil fuels and deforestation are warming the world’s atmosphere. Brazilian officials have cited protection of native vegetation as critical to meeting its obligations under the Paris Agreement on climate change. But scientists warn the biome has reached a tipping point that could hamper Brazil’s efforts and worsen global warming. By focusing on one problem, Brazil essentially created another, said Ane Alencar, science director of the non-profit Amazon Environmental Research Institute, known as IPAM. “There’s a high risk for the climate associated with this expansion,” Alencar said. “Limiting and calling attention to deforestation in the Amazon, in a way it forced the agribusiness industry to expand in the Cerrado.” The toll can already be seen in the region’s water resources. Streams and springs are filling with silt and drying up as vegetation around them vanishes. That in turn is weakening the headwaters of vital rivers flowing to the rest of the country, scientists say. The imperiled waterways include the Sao Francisco, Brazil’s longest river outside the Amazon, where water levels are hitting never-before-seen lows in the dry season. “The removal of vegetation can lead a body of water to extinction,” said Liliana Pena Naval, an environmental engineering professor at the Federal University of Tocantins. Wildlife, too, is under threat, including rare hyacinth macaws, maned wolves and jaguars that call the shrinking savanna home. So are thousands of plants, fish, insects and other creatures found nowhere else on earth, many of which are only beginning to be studied. “I compare it to the burning of the ancient Library of Alexandria,” said Mercedes Bustamante, an ecologist at the University of Brasilia. “You lose the accumulated evolutionary record of thousands of years that never can be recovered.” Farmers see the Cerrado’s development as critical to global food security and their nation’s prosperity. Brazil’s agriculture sector grew a sizzling 13 percent in 2017, while the overall economy barely budged. The nation’s ability to keep producing new farmland cheaply has given it an edge over rivals and cemented its status as a vital supplier to the world’s tables. “Imagine, if not for Brazil’s production, how much more hunger would there be,” farmer Pansera said. THE GREEN REVOLUTION Roughly the size of Mexico, straddling Brazil’s mid-section from its far western borders with Paraguay and stretching northeast towards the Atlantic coast, the Cerrado has seen about half of its native forests and grasslands converted to farms, pastures and urban areas over the past 50 years. Deforestation in the region has slowed from the early 2000s, when Brazil’s soy boom was gaining steam. Still, farmers continue to plow under vast stretches of the biome, propelled largely by Chinese demand for Brazilian meat and grain. The Asian nation is Brazil’s No. 1 buyer of soybeans to fatten its own hogs and chickens. China is also a major purchaser of Brazilian pork, beef and poultry to satisfy the tastes of its increasingly affluent consumers. Rising trade tensions between China and the United States have only deepened that connection. Brazil’s soybean exports by value to China are up 18 percent through the first seven months of the year as Chinese buyers have cancelled tens of millions of dollars’ worth of contracts with U.S. suppliers. The trend bodes well for producers in the Cerrado’s frontier region known as Matopiba, shorthand for the northeastern Brazilian states of Maranhao, Tocantins, Piaui and Bahia. Land here is cheap. Virgin plots near Pansera in the state of Tocantins can be had for $248 an acre on average, according to agribusiness consultancy Informa Economics IEG FNP. That compares to an average of $3,080 per acre for already cleared farmland in the United States. Soy planting in Matopiba has more than doubled over the past decade. Pansera, 50, is part of a wave of industrious transplants from southern Brazil who are remaking the region. His formal education stopped at middle school, but he found land enough in the Cerrado to match his big ambitions. He now presides over nearly 19 square miles (49 square kilometers) of manicured soy fields and has about 20 full-time workers on his payroll. Pansera’s soybeans will bring in an estimated profit of nearly 5 million reais ($1.23 million) this year, most of which he plans to invest back into the farm. Government policies have intentionally driven industrial-scale farming here. Short on farmland to feed its growing population, Brazil in the 1970s looked to its vast savanna, a region early explorers had dubbed “cerrado,” or “closed,” because of its tangled woodlands. State agriculture scientists developed fertilizers and additives to fix the acidic, nutrient-poor earth and created soybean strains that could thrive in the tropics. Arable land exploded. Within a decade, Brazil transformed itself from a food importer to a net exporter. By the 1990s it was moving global commodities markets. “Agriculture in the Cerrado is what took Brazil to the next level,” Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi told Reuters. Known as Brazil’s “Soy King,” Maggi is a billionaire whose family runs one of the largest private soybean operations in the world, much of it in the Cerrado. Maggi said growers are respectful of legally allowed limits on deforestation. Their “rational” occupation of the Cerrado has helped Brazil’s economy, he said. Farmers have emerged as a powerful political force bent on keeping Brazil’s countryside open for business. Lawmakers in the country’s largely rural, pro-agriculture voting bloc, who comprise more than 40 percent of the nation’s congress, have led a rollback of environmental laws in recent years. Those efforts include a 2012 loosening of Brazil’s landmark Forest Code that sets requirements for preserving native vegetation. The change reduced potential penalties for farmers, ranchers and loggers charged with past illegal deforestation, and made it easier for landowners to clear more of their holdings. Annual deforestation in the Amazon last year was up 52 percent from a record low in 2012. Still, environmental protections there remain the most robust in Brazil. Rainforest farmers are required by law to preserve 80 percent of native vegetation on their plots. And global grain traders in 2006 voluntarily agreed to stop purchasing any soy harvested from newly deforested Amazon jungle areas. As part of its obligations under the Paris Agreement, the government pledged to eliminate illegal Amazon deforestation by 2030. Brazil has made no similar push to preserve the Cerrado, which has long been viewed as a resource to be developed. Cerrado farmers are required to preserve as little as 20 percent of the natural cover, and up to 35 percent in areas neighbouring the Amazon. Those who don’t maximize use of their tracts risk having their land declared idle and subject to redistribution under a 1980 federal land-reform initiative aimed at assisting rural, low-income people, said Elvison Nunes Ramos, sustainability coordinator with the Ministry of Agriculture. “The message being sent to the farmer is that he should not preserve, he should deforest,” Nunes Ramos said of the policy. A spokesman for Incra, the government agency that verifies the use of the rural land, said its job is to ensure “the fulfillment of the social function of the property.” WATER, WILDLIFE UNDER THREAT Environmentalists say the Cerrado’s wooded grasslands have failed to capture the public’s attention the way the Amazon’s lush jungles have. People view the Cerrado “just as bushes, twisted vegetation and shrubs,” lamented Alencar, the science director at IPAM. What many don’t see, she said, is the connection between the soybean-fed meat on their plates and the steady decline of one of the world’s great carbon sinks, a bulwark against global warming. Plants here send roots deep into the earth to survive seasonal drought and fires, creating a vast underground network that some have likened to an upside-down forest. Destruction of surface vegetation, and the resulting die-off of the life below, released 248 million tonnes of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere in 2016, according to estimates by the Climate Observatory, a Brazilian conservation group. That’s roughly two-and-a-half times the annual tailpipe emissions from all cars in Brazil. Watersheds are hurting, too. In Palmeirante, a rural municipality in the state of Tocantins, subsistence farmer Ronivon Matias de Andrade blames expanding mega-farms for damaging a community water source. Dressed in faded shorts and flip flops, he showed a visitor the remains of what until recently had been a shady woodland: uprooted trees and freshly exposed earth pocked with heavy-equipment tracks. Stripped of its vegetation, sandy topsoil is now filling a nearby creek and an adjoining freshwater pool where he and other rural families draw drinking water. He scooped up a murky handful in disgust. “How many are being finished off in this manner in this state?” 43-year-old Andrade said. Environmentalists say vanishing creeks like those in Palmeirante are threatening the nation’s water supply. Seemingly insignificant sources - tiny brooks, nameless rivulets - are vital building blocks supplying water to tributary streams that in turn feed some of Brazil’s largest rivers. Of a dozen major water systems in Brazil, eight are born in the Cerrado. They include the Sao Francisco, the country’s fourth-largest river, which was once famed for its paddle-wheeled riverboats known as gaiolas. Environmentalists say man-made diversions, including agriculture and hydroelectric dams, have helped alter water levels to a degree that long stretches of the river are now unnavigable during the dry season. Loss of native ground cover is also driving microclimate change in the region, they say. Reduced vegetation leads to higher ground temperatures and lower humidity, a recipe for less rainfall. A study conducted at the University of Brasilia links deforestation to an 8.4 percent drop in precipitation from 1977 to 2010 in the Cerrado. Cerrado wildlife is under pressure as habitat shrinks. More than 300 species that dwell here are considered threatened with extinction, according to the government. Among them are 44 rare types of “annual fish” unique to the Cerrado whose short lives begin with spring rains and end with the summer heat. Scientists suspect that increasing dry spells could be interrupting their delicate reproduction cycles. Other creatures, including rheas - giant ostrich-like birds – will soon join the endangered species list if nothing is done to reverse the slide, says Ricardo Machado, a zoology professor at the University of Brasilia. He said the birds’ numbers have plummeted due to loss of native ground cover critical to breeding and nesting. Machado worries that unique Cerrado plants, insects and other creatures may vanish before scientists have an opportunity to identify them, much less study them. “There is a universe to be discovered,” Machado said. “All attention is focused on the Amazon, no one speaks for the Cerrado.” REINING IN THE SOY BOOM That’s beginning to change. Dozens of groups, including Greenpeace, the World Wildlife Foundation and the Brazilian research group IPAM, last year began pushing for large multinationals to protect the biome. In a document known as the Cerrado Manifesto, they called for immediate action to stop deforestation in the region. More than 60 companies, including McDonalds, Unilever and Walmart, have signed on so far. The firms have agreed to support measures that would eliminate native vegetation loss in the Cerrado from their supply chains. But in contrast to the 2006 Amazon soy moratorium, the Cerrado Manifesto did not commit signatories to halt purchases of farm products from newly deforested areas. Walmart and Unilever said they are committed to achieving zero net deforestation in their supply chains by 2020, meaning any destruction in one region would be offset by recuperation of similar forest elsewhere. Walmart said all its beef suppliers in the Cerrado are monitored to ensure they don’t contribute to deforestation there. McDonalds didn’t respond to a request for comment. Separately, Netherlands-based Louis Dreyfus Company in June became the first major commodity trader to pledge to stop buying soy from newly deforested land specifically in the Cerrado. The company gave no timetable, but said it would work to establish a “realistic target date” to end deforestation in its Cerrado supply chain. Brazil’s former Minister of Environment Jose Sarney Filho, who recently left office to run for Senate, has proposed an international effort to compensate landowners who preserve natural habitat. He raised the issue at last November’s global climate summit in Germany, but the effort has yet to attract major backers. Farmer Pansera, meanwhile, sees big things ahead for his patch of the Cerrado. Supervising the harvest on his land earlier this year, he watched a pair of combines chew through rows of soybean plants.

128,"As election looms, Modi's popularity wanes in rural India","Indian farmers voted overwhelmingly for Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2014 general election that swept him to power. He cannot count on them doing so again, as a crash in commodity prices and surging fuel costs stoke anger in the countryside.",https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKCN1IZ03O,2018-06-03T04:38:48Z,"KAIRANA, India (Reuters) - Indian farmers voted overwhelmingly for Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2014 general election that swept him to power. He cannot count on them doing so again, as a crash in commodity prices and surging fuel costs stoke anger in the countryside. Four years ago, Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, winning 73 of 80 seats, as the rural poor - swayed by promises of higher crop prices - deserted the rival Congress party. Now, facing criticism for not improving living standards in the countryside, where 70 percent of India’s 1.3 billion people live, analysts and farm economists said Modi would find it hard to repeat the feat in a general election due by May 2019. While it is risky to predict election outcomes in India, where religion and caste remain important issues – not to mention the influence of fickle regional parties - interviews with some of the state’s millions of farmers suggest rural angst could cost the government dearly. “No doubt, there was a wave for Modi in 2014, but farmers are disenchanted with him now,” said sugar cane grower Uday Vir Singh, 53, plonking down on a wicker chair and smoking his hookah. “Modi promised to double farmers’ income but our earning has halved because of his apathy and anti-farmer policies.” Nearly half a dozen farmers sitting with Singh on a hand-woven rope cot, and many of others in Kairana - which elected a joint opposition candidate from a small regional party in a key by-election this week - accused Modi and the Uttar Pradesh administration, also run by the BJP, of failing to live up to their promises and overlooking the concerns of villagers. “Modi is a very good salesman but we are not going to fall prey to his glib talk again,” said 55-year-old Narendra Kalhande, who grows cane on his 2.5 acre farm. Farm Minister Radha Mohan Singh defended the government’s record, citing initiatives on irrigation, crop insurance and electronic trading platforms for farmers to sell produce. “For farmers, Prime Minister Modi’s 48 months have been much better than the Congress’s rule of 48 years,” Singh told Reuters, referring to the main opposition party that dominated Indian politics for most of the years since independence from British colonial rule in 1947. CRISIS IN COUNTRYSIDE Higher inflation and sluggish growth helped Modi trounce Congress, which had long counted the rural poor as its core constituency, in the 2014 election. Small farmers had been hit by rising living costs but benefited little from rising food prices because of the web of middlemen in India’s agricultural markets. Since then the economy has picked up, recording its quickest pace of expansion in nearly two years in the first three months of 2018, helped by higher growth in the farm sector. But lower food prices, weaker farm wages and modest crop procurement rates - the result of a shift in focus from the subsidies favoured by Congress to investment under the pro-business BJP - have hurt most of India’s 263 million farmers, who typically own less than 2 hectares of land. In the past year, Modi’s popularity has fallen by 12 percentage points among farmers, according to a “Mood of the Nation” survey published last week by the Lokniti, part of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), a research institute. Next year’s election would be fought on farmers’ issues, said Yogendra Yadav, a leading academic-turned-politician. Farmer organisations in some states began a 10-strike on Friday, in which they have said they will stop selling produce to protest a steep drop in the prices of an array of farm goods. Farm Minister Singh said his government had yet to hear from farm leaders but was ready to listen. COMMODITIES CRASH Prices of pulses, a key crop for Indian farmers, have fallen 25-30 percent below state-set support prices, as higher imports and bumper local crops bumped up supplies. While the government announces support prices for more than 20 crops each year to set a benchmark, state agencies actually buy only rice and wheat at the support level. Vegetable prices, especially onions, cabbage and tomatoes have fallen 25 percent from last year, largely because of the lack of refrigerated trucks that could take the perishables to the consuming big cities. Milk prices have also dived by more than 25 percent in the past year as a global glut has brought exports to a near halt. Farmers in Charkhi Dadri, three hours’ drive west of the capital New Delhi, recently dumped tomatoes onto the road in protest after buyers offered a quarter of a rupee per kilogram for a crop that costs at least 6 rupees ($0.09) a kg to produce. Jai Bhagwan, 54, borrowed 12,000 rupees to grow onions on a plot of about half acre in Jhajjar, an area otherwise famed for pottery. When his crop was ready, Jai Bhagwan could get only 1,200 rupees. “I could not even recover my labour cost,” said Jai Bhagwan, who was in New Delhi recently to participate in a farmers’ meet. Prakash Singh, also from Jhajjar, spent 6,000 rupees to grow green chilli, but the crop fetched him barely 200 rupees. “I’m in debt up to my eyeballs. But I can’t sit idle, so I’ll have to borrow more to grow something else,” Singh said. Ashok Gulati, a farm economist who advised India’s last government, said there were three policy options to support farmers: building state buffer stocks to soak up excess supply, acting to boost exports or building capacity for processing farm commodities into end products such as milled, dehusked pulses or vegetable oils. Most of those measures would require long-term structural changes, however, and analysts predict in the run-up to the election Modi is likely to announce more populist, short-term fixes such as higher guaranteed prices for crops and farm loan waivers. Many farmers complained they are still reeling from disruptions caused by the launch of a new nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July 2017 and a ban on high denomination bank notes in November 2016. Blaming the shock move for exacerbating farmers’ financial woes, Gulati said: “Expectations were high from the government, but the fact is that the plight of farmers is far worse now than what it was four years ago.” Modi’s drive to purge “black money” from the economy by removing, at a stroke, 86 percent of the cash in circulation, made it difficult for farmers, who survive on cash, to buy inputs like seeds and receive payments for their crops. In Kairana, all 35 farmers Reuters spoke to agreed that abolishing 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes had made things worse. POWER SURGE Farmers in Uttar Pradesh, home to 220 million people, are also angry over a sharp rise in the pump price of diesel and a steep hike in electricity tariffs. Many farmers in the state use diesel to run tractors for ploughing and trolleys for moving their produce to wholesale markets. They depend on electricity to operate irrigation pumps. Diesel prices have shot up by more than 40 percent to record highs and electricity tariffs have surged by more 20 percent in the past two years, said Shri Pal, a farmer from Shamli. “Villages account for most of India’s diesel consumption and that’s why higher prices pinch farmers the most, but diesel in India is much more expensive than Bhutan, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka,” said Hannan Mollah, a former lawmaker and a senior official of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Kairana and Shamli lie in the sugar cane belt of Uttar Pradesh, the top sugar state of India, the world’s biggest producer after Brazil. Soaring global output has caused a collapse in sugar prices, leading to losses for mills who now owe nearly 23 billion rupees to cane growers. A BJP spokesman, G.V.L. Narasimha Rao, said the government has streamlined timely payments to cane growers. That has not been enough to satisfy farmers such as Ram Lakhan Singh, a cane grower from Shamli. “Most sugar mills have not paid us a single rupee since December and the government has connived with them to deprive us of our rightful dues. Trust me, cane farmers will think twice before voting for the BJP.” Reporting by Mayank Bhardwaj; Editing by Alex Richardson",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

White ( jwhite@politico.com ) and Carla Marinucci ( cmarinucci@politico.com ) with Maya Parthasarathy ( mparthasarathy@politico.com ) THE BUZZ: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is downplaying the growing Democratic calls for the impeachment of Donald Trump, saying that the ""president’s day of reckoning"" came this week and underscores the need to safeguard Special Counsel Robert Mueller from any possible White House retribution. Story Continued Below -- ""What happened [Tuesday] advances the argument to protect the Mueller investigation,"" she told reporters following a speech at the Public Policy Institute in San Francisco. Referring to Trump attorney Michael Cohen’s guilty plea, the conviction of the president’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and the indictment of GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter, she called Tuesday ""a sad day for America."" -- But she said impeachment shouldn't be preeminent: “I’ve always said that what we have to do is bring people together. If there’s evidence that the president should be impeached, let that emerge. But for us, our responsibility is to improve the lives of the American people – lower their health care costs, increase their paycheck and make government work for them.” (Hours after Pelosi delivered that message, state Senator and US Senate candidate Kevin de León underscored how the question may divides Dems by blasting out a fundraising email blaring the subject line “IMPEACH IMPEACH IMPEACH”). -- And Pelosi repudiated efforts to connect her to the”Abolish ICE movement: Asked about wanting to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency – which Trump accused her of in a video released Thursday – Pelosi told the PPIC audience: ""I don't agree with that at all."" While she said some reform of ICE policies may be in order, she added it’s clear that accomplishing that is ""going to require having to win the election."" But she warned that calls to abolish ICE entirely ""gives grist to the mill"" of those who say Democrats want open borders. Story by POLITICO's Carla Marinucci in San Francisco. BUENOS DÍAS, Good Thursday morning. A labor-backed #MeToo bill and a net neutrality measure advanced, a former top Facebook official warned it’s too late to protect the 2018 elections and senators turned up the heat on Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination. -- “Where’s Jerry?” Nothing official announced.

Kamala Harris was meeting with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, an avalanche hit Washington in the form of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort’s conviction and former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen’s guilty plea implication the president. -- Harris reacted by pivoting from opposing Kavanaugh’s nomination to saying his confirmation hearings should be put on hold, echoing numerous other Senate Dems. “An unindicted co-conspirator to a crime should not be in the business of having the ability to appoint somebody to a lifetime position on the highest court in our land - a court which invariably would hear the matters that are the subject of this discussion,” Harris told NBC News' Andrea Mitchell. -- Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee advanced the same argument, saying the fast-approaching hearing must be delayed: “The possibility of criminal wrongdoing by the president, combined with existing doubts that Brett Kavanaugh believes a president can even be investigated, demand further review of this situation,” the ranking Judiciary Committee member said in a statement. -- “Trump-friendly think tank struggles to weed out racism from its ranks,” by POLITICO’s Eliana Johnson: “It took just 80 minutes after racially incendiary emails started flying for the Claremont Institute, a conservative think tank, to shut down an email Listserv connecting hundreds of high-profile conservatives.” Story STEYER SPEAKS: “Billionaire Tom Steyer Is Rallying Voters Who Believe President Trump Should Be Impeached,” by Katy Steinmetz for TIME: “Steyer, whom some style as a counterweight to the Koch Brothers, has topped lists of individual donors in recent election cycles and may prove the biggest spender in 2018.” Story. -- “How long will Kevin McCarthy and other California Republicans stay silent on Trump?” the Sac Bee’s editorial board wonders: “Seriously, what will it take for California Republicans in Congress to hold President Donald Trump to account?” Editorial. -- “Kimberly Guilfoyle was once half of a liberal power couple. Now she’s basically a Trump,” by Sarah Ellison and Dan Zak in the Washington Post: “In the summer of 2004, the new mayor and first lady of San Francisco were photographed for an eight-page spread in Harper’s Bazaar. Gavin Newsom wore a thousand-dollar tuxedo, and Kimberly Guilfoyle Newsom had on a black dress that was twice the price. The magazine thought their young marriage would be ‘one of the most glamorous political unions since Jack and Jackie.’” Story. CALIFORNIA AND THE CAPITOL CORRIDOR: NET NEUTRALITY GETS FIERY: The timing on this one was striking. As a state Assembly Committee prepared to take up a landmark bill prohibiting internet service providers from treating online traffic unevenly — the bill’s first hearing since it collapsed amid recriminations and was revived — Ars Technica dug up a court filing from this week in which Santa Clara County fire chief Anthony Bowden accused Verizon of throttling his agency as firefighters were battling the sprawling Mendocino Complex inferno. (Verizon refuted Bowden’s characterization in a statement that the situation was unrelated to net neutrality but reflected a “customer support mistake”). -- The revelation ricocheted quickly across the internet, with state Attorney General Xavier Becerra sharing the story and citing it as an example of why net neutrality is essential: “it can mean the difference between life/death.” Assemblyman Freddie Rodriguez cited the story during yesterday’s hearing as a cause for concern; state Sen. Scott Wiener, the bill’s champion, called it “very disturbing to many of us” and “evidence of how critically important internet access is to everything.” -- SB 822 cleared the state Assembly Communications and Conveyance Committee, but that wasn’t unexpected. The real test should come in an Assembly floor vote, and the list of telecommunications and business representatives denouncing the bill during yesterday’s hearing demonstrated that this fight is far from over. -- “The Green Economy: Is California’s bid to lead the world on climate solutions paying off at home?” by Julie Cart in CalMatters: “California, the world’s fifth-largest economy, spends billions of dollars every year to support its dozens of climate-change programs but has trouble demonstrating whether the promise of the law that spawned them has been kept.” Story OFFICE POLITICS: A labor priority bill with a #MeToo connection is heading to Gov. Jerry Brown: The measure would limit employers’ ability to force workers to resolve labor disputes via forced arbitration, a practice that is a longtime target for union foes. Brown vetoed a prior version of this bill, but advocates returned this year with a revamped version that they framed as a way to prevent victims of harassment or abuse from being silenced — a push that brought Jane Fonda to Sacramento earlier this year. As with the last version, business groups have presented a wall of opposition. -- “Are the estimates of Catholic Church victims and offenders too low in California? Group pleads for grand jury probe to find out,” by Matthias Gaffni in the East Bay Times: “A Catholic abuse victim’s advocacy group sent a letter Wednesday to California Attorney General Xavier Becerra asking for an independent statewide probe into decades of priest molestations and the church’s pattern of covering up the abuse, similar to the groundbreaking grand jury report released earlier this month in Pennsylvania.” Story TIME OVER: “Soaring overtime fattens paychecks of California cops and firefighters. But at a cost” by SacBee’s Phillip Reese and Adam Ashton: “‘The overtime our officers are working is becoming a problem for them. We’re at the point where we’re asking too much, I fear,’ said Lodi City Manager Steve Schwabauer. Overtime spending in his city is up $1.9 million, or 168 percent, over 2012.” Story. -- “Some California counties reject U.S. policy of killing predatory wildlife” by SFChronicle’s Peter Fimrite: “Under threat of a lawsuit by animal protection groups, Siskiyou County announced last Thursday that it would terminate its contract in 90 days with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Wildlife Services, which provides trappers to counties for predator control.” Story. -- “Faulconer’s Homelessness Record Marked by Reluctance, Struggles and a Few Successes,” by Voice of SD’s Lisa Halverstadt: “The fact that there won’t be any measures on the November ballot to address San Diego’s homelessness crisis is only the latest struggle in what may be the defining issue of Mayor Kevin Faulconer’s tenure.” Story. CAMPAIGNS 2018 AND BEYOND: ELECTION SECURITY: With the FBI examining cyberattacks on multiple California campaigns, Secretary of State Alex Padilla is headed to Chicago to speak to Democratic National Committee officials about threats to the integrity of the midterm elections. Padilla has been a fierce critic of Trump, including the president’s reluctance to admit that Russia sought to influence the 2016 election, and has blasted Republicans for not allocating more for election security. BUT: “It’s Too Late to Protect the 2018 Elections. But Here’s How the U.S. Can Prepare for 2020,” former chief Facebook security officer Alex Stamos writes on the Lawfare blog: “America’s adversaries believe that it is still both safe and effective to attack U.S. democracy using American technologies and the freedoms we cherish.” Story -- “The Silicon Valley Organization is in turmoil just months before the election” by MercNews’ Emily Deruy: “The Silicon Valley Organization (SVO) — the region’s main Chamber of Commerce — and the SVO PAC — a committee set up to support business-friendly candidates — have been fighting for months over whether the latter is autonomous from the former. It’s become so heated that in the last week, several members of the PAC have resigned and now they and others are launching a new PAC.” Story.

A dense screen of charcoal-gray trees stands between the open ground and the backyards of several houses. The trees are callery pears, the escaped offspring of landscape specimens and street trees from the neighborhood. With no gardener to guide them, the spindly wildlings form an impenetrable thicket of dark twigs with three-inch thorns. Bergmann, a field botanist for the Montgomery County Parks Department, extricates herself from the thicket and in the meadow shows me that what I take to be blades of grass are actually shoots of trees, mowed to a few inches high. There are countless thousands, hiding in plain sight in Great Seneca Stream Valley Park. If it were not cut back once a year, the meadow would become like the adjacent screen, wall upon wall, acre upon acre of black-limbed, armored trees worthy of Sleeping Beauty’s castle. “You can’t mow this once and walk away,” said Bergmann, who began her 25-year career in the department as a forest ecologist but has been consumed by an ever-pressing need to address the escape of the Bradford pear and other variants of callery pear, a species that originated in China, along with other invasive exotics. [ Revered, then reviled: Tracking the rise and fall of ivy ] The U.S. Agriculture Department scientists who gave us the Bradford pear thought they were improving our world. Instead, they left an environmental time bomb that has now exploded. From the 1960s to the 1990s, the callery pear was the urban planner’s gift from above. A seedling selection named Bradford was cloned by the gazillion to become the ubiquitous street tree of America’s postwar suburban expansion. The Bradford pear seemed to leap from an architect’s idealized rendering. But in this case, reality outshone the artist’s vision. It was upright and symmetric in silhouette. It exploded with white flowers when we most needed it, in early spring. Its glossy green leaves shimmered coolly in the summer heat, and in the fall, its foliage turned crimson, maroon and orange — a perfect New England study in autumnal color almost everywhere it grew. And it grew everywhere. It flourished in poor soil, wet or dry, acidic or alkaline. It shrugged off pests and diseases, it didn’t drop messy fruit like mulberries or crab apples. Millions of Bradford pears would be planted from California to Massachusetts and would come to signal the dream and aspirations of postwar suburbia. Like the cookie-cutter suburbs themselves, the Bradford pear would embody that quintessentially American idea of the goodness of mass-produced uniformity. But like a comic book supervillain who had started off good, the Bradford pear crossed over to something darker. It turned from thornless to spiky, limber to brittle, chaste to promiscuous, tame to feral. Most of all, it became invasive. It is now an ecological marauder destined to continue its spread for decades, long after those suburban tract houses have faded away. Generations yet to be born will come to know this tree and learn to hate it. It is at its most conspicuous in early spring, when it bursts into flower. Suddenly whole rural landscapes — meadows, old pastures, woodland edges, ditches, the sides of highways and railroads — are lit up by its blossoms. From early March to mid-April, you can now track the arrival and progression of spring in the United States not as amber waves of grain but as a frothing tide of Bradford pear. You might even enjoy its beauty, until you realize that it is squeezing out native flora and reducing biodiversity. As eye-catching as the flowers are, they are simply the start of the seasonal march of this invader. Six months after the blooms appear, clusters of seedy berries invite birds to fatten up for winter. In the bird’s droppings, the seeds will germinate and advance, becoming ever more genetically diverse in the process and making the pear ever more adapted to its own spread. Its invasive tendencies became widely noticed by the late 1990s, and by the mid-2000s, it had become a weed in the District and 19 states, from Texas to New York. “While callery pear was introduced with the best of intentions, it now seems that a plague is truly upon us,” botanist Michael Vincent wrote at the time. It has now spread to 29 states. The roots of the Bradford pear fiasco go back more than a century, and had nothing to do with decorating suburbia. By the turn of the 20th century, Northern California and southern Oregon had become the centers of pear production in the United States. The common or European pear was a high-value fruit; in one Oregon county alone, Jackson, the pear industry in 1916 was worth a mind-boggling $10 million. But the orchards were threatened by a new disease called fire blight. George Roeding, a nurseryman in Fresno, Calif., wrote in 1916 that “in the San Joaquin Valley, which sixteen years ago was one of the great pear producing sections of California, the pear has been absolutely wiped out of existence.” In Talent, Ore., a plant scientist named Frank Reimer was using a test orchard to work on fire-blight control and found that the callery pear, first brought to the States in 1908, was highly resistant to fire blight and might be used as a rootstock onto which varieties of the European pear could be grafted. The much smaller callery fruit is used to make tea in China but is considered inedible. [ There are hundreds of recorded types of some fruits. You wouldn’t know it from stores. ] But to take his research further, Reimer needed lots of genetically rich wild seed from China. He turned to David Fairchild, a dynamic young botanist in Washington. Fairchild is best remembered as the guy who helped bring the Japanese cherry blossoms to the capital, by first growing 125 imported trees on his estate in Chevy Chase, Md. Fairchild headed the Agriculture Department’s Office of Foreign Seed and Plant Introduction. He traveled far during his career in search of new plants, but he relied on another explorer, Frank Meyer, in the quest for a super-pear. Meyer, an emigre from the Netherlands, had already explored extensively in northern and central China when Fairchild tapped him, in 1916, to go to southern China. (Meyer is best known for giving Americans the lemon variety named after him.) In an age before passenger jets and digital communication, the quest for the callery pear would be no quick or easy excursion. A century ago, plant explorers needed an extraordinary set of skills to complete their missions and survive a range of perils. A haunting image of Meyer in China is captured in a 1908 photo. With a big black beard, sheepskin leggings and a staff, he is seen gazing into the distance from a mountainous, arid landscape. All about him, burlapped cuttings rest like tablets brought down from Mount Sinai. He is in his early 30s but seems older. Meyer left Washington in mid-August of 1916, traveling west to see Reimer’s pear trials in Oregon and finally departing Seattle bound for Japan on the last day of summer. Within a couple of months, he had sent six large shipments of seed from Beijing containing pine nuts, walnuts and chestnuts, but no callery pear. Fairchild, exasperated that Meyer was hanging around Beijing, urged him to make his way up the Yangtze River to look for the callery. “You must not leave any stone unturned to secure it,” he wrote. The correspondence between Meyer and Fairchild form part of an archive of the Chinese expedition in the National Agricultural Library in Beltsville, Md. Meyer eventually made his way to Yichang, a four-day boat ride from Hankou (now Wuhan) up the Yangtze, and he soon found wild-growing callery pears, if not in the extravagant amounts Reimer was seeking. “Altho’ not rare in the hills around here, the trees are very widely scattered, they are often quite small and as such produce individually but little fruit,” he wrote. Many of the trees were stunted in dry, poor sites, but one remarkable aspect of this species soon became apparent. It could grow virtually anywhere. Meyer recorded pear trees on sterile mountain slopes, on the edge of a pond in wet soil, on screes, in bamboo stands and even in running water. Having made arrangements for locals to collect and process the seed the following fall, he set out to southern China in search of other plants but got only as far as Hankou, where he took to his bed with “nervous prostration.” After several weeks of rest and therapy he was back on his feet, and by late summer, he had made his way to the area around Jingmen, today a large city in Hubei province. He sent his first shipment of callery pear seed to Fairchild in September, and the following month he teamed up with Reimer and gathered another 25 pounds of seed — enough to grow a small forest of callery pears. Reimer also collected on his own, before the two men went to Yichang in early November. Another calamity was about to overtake Meyer, however, as China had become gripped by spreading internal strife. Factional warlords fought for dominance. This kept him confined to Yichang while seeds and notes were isolated in Jingmen. “As I am writing,” he wrote in February 1918, “we hear the rickety noise of rifle fire.” That spring, he made his way to Jingmen to retrieve his pear seeds and baggage, and then took a steamer down the Yangtze back to Hankou. On the evening of May 31, 1918, Meyer boarded another ship sailing downriver to Shanghai, where he planned to stay a month to escape the heat of Hankou and to ship his pear seeds to Fairchild. Meyer had been suffering from a stomach ailment but appeared to be getting better the next day, a Saturday. His mental state may have been getting worse. Meyer told his servant Yao Feng T’ing that his father and some old friends had come to him in a dream, and that he considered this an omen. That Saturday night, when the boat was about 30 miles upriver from the city of Wuhu, Meyer was seen by a cabin boy making for the deck. The lad thought Meyer was going to the toilet, but he was never seen alive again. His body was fished out of the Yangtze four days later near a settlement named Ti Keng. Samuel Sokobin, the American vice consul in Shanghai, conducted an investigation and reported that although it seemed Meyer had not been killed, it was “impossible to state” whether Meyer’s death was an accident or suicide. Signs point to the latter. After talking to the explorer’s servant and fellow passengers, Sokobin wrote: “It appears certain that Mr. Meyer had been depressed for some time.” He was 42. Sokobin had Meyer’s body moved to the Protestant Cemetery in Shanghai and his seed collections sent to Washington. Reimer, in his time with Meyer in Jingmen, had come to see just how low he was. “He told me of his life’s struggles,” he later wrote. “Few people ever realized the tremendous battle that was raging in his soul.” The seed that Meyer and others would collect ended up in Reimer’s test orchard in Oregon and the U.S. Plant Introduction Station in Glenn Dale, then a rural enclave in Prince George’s County. In the early 1950s, a horticulturist at Glenn Dale named John L. Creech began to see the callery pears there not as a rootstock for the common pear but as an extraordinarily handsome and tough street tree in its own right. He latched on to a single specimen that had been grown from seed that was not part of Meyer’s shipment but acquired soon afterward in Nanjing as part of Fairchild’s same feverish search for callery pear seed. The tree was 30 years old when Creech first evaluated it, and judging from his later writings, he was besotted by this specimen. He was struck by its vigor, its handsome, mature spread and its evident ornamental qualities. But a plant’s value lies too in what it is not. This one tree did not have the thorns of other callery pears; it was free of diseases and pests and held together in storms. In selecting this individual to mass-produce, Creech named it Bradford after the station’s former head, F.C. Bradford. This specimen’s resilience in storms belied what would become a major problem with its mass-produced Bradford clones: Tight branch-to-trunk angles and congested branching invited the limbs to break apart. Before releasing the Bradford ornamental pear to the nursery trade, Creech decided to trial it in the nearby Washington suburb of University Park, which was then treeless and had difficult soil — perfect for putting this wondertree to the test. He planted 180 saplings in 1954. He pruned them to keep lower branches out of the way of pedestrians and cars, but also to give each tree a handsome profile. This undoubtedly produced more attractive and useful trees but further hid the Bradford’s weak-wooded Achilles’ heel. Happy with its performance in University Park — some of the original Bradfords are still there, as lanky, open shade trees — he officially released the Bradford pear to the nursery trade in January 1960 and invited growers to obtain shoots for grafting onto callery pear seedlings. Each Bradford scion would be genetically identical, but the rootstocks each had their own DNA. This would come back to bite us. For a few innocent years, the only thing working against the Bradford pear was its ubiquity. It was so golden that every nursery grower wanted to propagate it and every home builder and highway department wanted to plant it. In 1966, Creech and his colleague William Ackerman wrote that the University Park plantings had displayed very little fruit, in contrast to the situation back at Glenn Dale, where the whole zoo of callery pears — 2,500 seedlings — had produced “abundant fruit development” on similarly aged Bradfords. Their point was that if you kept Bradfords away from other pears, messy fruiting wouldn’t be a problem. But they clearly missed the ecological repercussions. And in the University Park planting, they noticed something else that should have raised alarms. On a few grafted trees where the scion had failed, the rootstock had produced suckers that then bloomed. These flowers, with the help of bees, caused the “sterile” street trees to set viable fruit. Creech and Ackerman minimized the problem, saying it was highly localized. Clues to the callery pear’s invasiveness are buried in a journal paper written by Ackerman in 1977, when he announced the introduction of another variety named Whitehouse, chosen because it was more upright than Bradford and better suited to small gardens. But this selection was a fugitive from Glenn Dale, growing as a seed deposited by a bird on a neighboring property; Bradford was one of its parents. The callery pear had escaped the reservation. Four years later, the National Arboretum introduced an even more columnar variety named Capital. Meanwhile, commercial plant breeders were bringing to market other varieties of the callery pear, and by the mid-1980s, a dozen or so were available for planting. Many of these were introduced to get around the Bradford’s poor branch structure and propensity to break. Sterile by themselves, any two of these varieties together would produce a heavy fruit set for winter bird dispersal. The stage was set for the callery pear’s quiet occupation of the countryside. Since 2012, Bergmann has led efforts to contain the callery pear on 232 acres, though it has been mapped on 425 acres within the Montgomery park system and may occupy countless more areas, she said. Crews have employed a number of tactics, including felling trees with chain saws, girdling their trunks with a blade and spraying the wound with a systemic herbicide. But the trees are mostly beaten back with an annual cutting by a Bush Hog mower or in woodier areas a beefier machine called a forestry mulcher. “It’s not a fix like building a bridge or putting down a road,” she said. “Once you cut down a field of Bradford pears, they’re going to try to come back.” It seems that the callery pear has been a curse to those who tried to master it. Wild trees of Pyrus calleryana in China are not invasive or particularly common. It’s what we did to the pear that has turned it against us: We brought it to an alien environment, selected one for unnatural propagation and then fused genetically different individuals together. We planted it intensively across the entire continental United States, seeding its eventual spread. Today it is a roving, free-range freak. In Mary Shelley’s epic tale, Victor Frankenstein laments the monster he created. “I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I gave existence,” he tells Captain Walton. If Creech had regrets about introducing the Bradford pear, he kept them to himself. In economic terms for nursery growers, the tree was manna from heaven. By the 1990s, he knew of its structural ailments and the problem with self-seeding. But when these were raised, his response was always the same. “He would say, ‘Yes, the tree has had its problems, but it put a lot of kids through college,’ ” said Lynn Batdorf, the arboretum’s retired boxwood expert, who was a young horticulturist under Creech in the 1970s. A decorated World War II Army veteran who ended the war in a German POW camp, Creech was beloved by the horticulturists who worked for him. He organized scientifically important plant-collecting trips to Japan and presided over a golden period of ornamental tree and shrub development at Glenn Dale and later at the National Arboretum, where he was director from 1973 to 1980. He leveraged his contacts in Japan to establish the world-famous bonsai collection at the arboretum. I sat down with the current arboretum director, Richard T. Olsen, and asked him to explain how Creech could have gotten the Bradford pear so wrong. Olsen says you can’t judge what happened without understanding the historical context. The mission of scientists like Creech and Fairchild was to find and manipulate plants in a way that solved a problem, met an unmet need or simply offered an attractive new plant for the American nursery industry and consumers. Olsen recites Thomas Jefferson’s line: “The greatest service which can be rendered any country is to add a useful plant to its culture.” For Creech and his peers working in the 1950s, the potential environmental effects were not part of the decision-making. “These people were pretty smart,” Olsen said. “Our values have changed.” In addition, he said, invasive plants have been enabled in their spread by centuries of environmental disturbance. “If we think in our forests we are dealing with a pristine habitat, we are deluding ourselves,” he said. Peter Del Tredici, a retired senior research scientist at Harvard’s Arnold Arboretum, said the concept of exotic invasive species didn’t emerge until 30 years ago, even though European settlers recorded escaped plants as early as 1672. Only a fraction of nonnative ornamental plants become invasive, but those that do have the capacity to completely transform natural areas. Bergmann has established an army of weed-control volunteers to work in county parks, but the idea of eradicating almost 40 species of key invasives is unrealistic. [ The horticulture industry’s age problem is bigger than you think ] “Without thinking much about it, we have globalized our environment in much the same way we have globalized our economy,” Del Tredici has written. He lives in the Boston suburb of Watertown, where he is seeing the first wave of callery pear invasion, young plants “in highly disturbed habitats where no maintenance has occurred,” he told me. In the South, the march of the callery is much more evident. “It’s definitely starting to really become a prominent invasive in Alabama,” said Nancy Loewenstein, an extension specialist at Auburn University. She sees it in disturbed industrialized areas, in the understory of pine plantations and along the banks of the Alabama River and other riparian areas. “There are some areas that are just white in the spring,” she said. Bergmann, who is 67 and looking at the end of her career, says she owes it to future generations to try to contain the Bradford pear and other invasives in the hope that one day scientists can find a way to eradicate them. It is a problem that Fairchild could not have envisioned a century ago, but the Bradford pear persists as a case study in how even the brightest scientific minds can be blind to what they might be creating long after they have gone. In November 1917, Fairchild wrote to Meyer thanking him for the first batch of callery pear seed. “I believe,” he predicted, “these will hardly fail to have in them something of extreme value for this country.” [ Higgins will host a live Q&amp;A on the Bradford pear — and all things gardening — Sept. 24 at 12 p.m. Submit your questions now. ] @adrian_higgins on Twitter",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Griffiths ( bgriffiths@politico.com ; @BrentGriffiths) GOOD MORNING, MASSACHUSETTS. Story Continued Below STORM POLITICS REPORT — As a fourth winter storm knocks Massachusetts with more of a whisper than a wallop, the state House and Senate leaders of the committees on Global Warming and Climate Change say Gov. Charlie Baker ’s week-old $1.4 billion environmental bond bill (with $300 million for infrastructure and mitigation and prevention of climate change) doesn’t go far enough to gird the state from the effects of climate change. And Senate chair Marc Pacheco specifically criticized the timing around Baker’s proposals. “It’s good optics, when you talk about politics, it all sounds good, but when you really have a chance to analyze the bill’s language,” Pacheco told me. “When I read it, I found a watered-down version of the climate adaptation bill that had already passed the Senate.” The Senate bill in reference has been passed multiple times by the body, and stalled out before getting to the House floor. Pacheco says his full response to the bill itself was delayed in part because he and others had only seen the text of the governor’s proposal the morning of the announcement. “The danger is that we can’t think that we’re solving something just based upon the optics of what the governor has filed,” Pacheco said. Pacheco (and his House counterpart state Rep. Frank Smizik ) said any comprehensive response would require a so-called coastal buy-back program that would enable the state to buy-back coastal properties frequently demolished by storms, as well as the need for a comprehensive, statewide plan to respond to climate change. Smizik hinted at the potential those proposals be folded into the finished bill by the House and Senate. “Though I am glad that the bill would significantly boost funding to help municipalities plan for the impacts of climate change, the Legislature must expand the bill’s reach,” Smizik said in a statement. “We must include provisions allowing for coastal buyback and requiring that policies be consistent with the statewide climate adaptation plan.” Meanwhile, 47 percent of Massachusetts voters say the state is “somewhat prepared” to deal with the effects of climate change, according to new polling from MassINC and WBUR. Only six percent say the state is “very prepared” while 16 percent say Massachusetts is “not at all prepared.” Have a tip, story, suggestion, birthday, anniversary, new job, or any other nugget for the Playbook?

132,FEINSTEIN has TRUMP’s ear on assault weapons -- STEYER’s town hall strategy -- JERRY to NYC -- Report: RUSSIA compromised CALIFORNIA elections -- ICE slams Oakland's SCHAAF,,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/california-playbook/2018/03/01/feinstein-gets-trumps-ear-on-assault-weapons-steyers-town-hall-strategy-jerry-to-nyc-report-russia-compromised-california-elections-trump-tweetslams-california-again-251735,2018-03-01T14:15:21Z,"By Carla Marinucci ( cmarinucci@politico.com ) and David Siders ( dsiders@politico.com ) and with Candice Norwood ( cnorwood@politico.com ) THE BUZZ: After a very rough weekend and an embarrassing snub from her own party in San Diego last weekend, Sen. Dianne Feinstein Wednesday seized a moment in the national spotlight that perfectly illustrated why she may just coast to a sixth term in November. Story Continued Below -- Sitting next to President Donald Trump at the White House, California’s senior senator dramatized exactly the point she’d argued to Democrats while unsuccessfully seeking their endorsement at the state party convention: She’s the nation’s foremost advocate on the issue of gun safety and an assault weapons ban. -- That White House photo op underscored DiFi’s unique strength on that issue: a history rooted in tragedy of San Francisco City Hall murders of Mayor George Moscone and Harvey Milk, and the 101 California massacre in San Francisco, one of the earliest mass shootings to evoke widespread public outrage. -- EXPERIENCE FACTOR : Feinstein didn’t attack Trump, but instead used the opportunity to carefully walk him through the the effects of assault weapons ban she authored in the 1990s. He said: “It’s something you have to think about.” He asked Republicans to help incorporate her ideas into legislation. Will anything happen? These days, a battle-scarred Democratic senator on Capitol Hill knows: A sliver of hope is better than none. -- So yes, California Democrats’ voted in favor of State Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León over the more moderate senior senator in the party’s endorsement battle. But de León’s challenge after moments like these is to seize back the spotlight. No easy task. POTUS TWEET THIS A.M.: @RealDonaldTrump: ""Many ideas, some good &amp; some not so good, emerged from our bipartisan meeting on school safety yesterday at the White House. Background Checks a big part of conversation. Gun free zones are proven targets of killers. After many years, a Bill should emerge. Respect 2nd Amendment!"" -- LATimes’ Sarah D. Wire’s take: “Feinstein shakes with glee after Trump suggests adding assault weapons ban to background check bill” -- Story. Watch the video via Mediaite: Link. -- HOW IT PLAYS IN THE BELTWAY -- Former Issa and Breitbart spokesman Kurt Bardella in USA Today -- “If Democrats run in 2018 like they're running in California, they're in big trouble,’’ via USA Today: “If you’ve been in politics long enough, you’ve heard the phrase, “As goes California, so goes the nation.” In the case of the 2018 midterm elections, this could spell bad news for Democrats and good news for Republicans.” Story. BUENOS DÍAS, good Thursday morning. Trump has suggested the border wall in California is on hold — and that’s not upsetting people here.

STEYER’S PLAN: HIT THE ROAD -- Now that his NeedtoImpeach.com petition drive can boast of scoring five million signatures as of this week, billionaire activist Tom Steyer is ramping it up with “the next phase” for action heading toward 2018 elections, his campaign strategist Kevin Mack tells POLITICO. -- THE BIG TOUR -- Steyer will hit the road on a 90-day, 30-event “town hall” tour, that starts in two weeks in a still-to-be-revealed “Republican-leaning, purple” Midwest region is part of a “public engagement and education” drive to talk about issues relating to Trump’s presidency, Mack tells POLITICO. Other plans: -- An aggressive emphasis on “Trump’s financial issues and how they may impact the decisions he’s making as president,’’ a topic which comes directly out of Steyer’s own financial background. “It’s something we’re going to shine a big light on,’’ says Mack. -- Spanish-language media: Steyer’s five ads to date have reached an estimated 454 million views on social media. He’ll debut his first Latino-focused ad next week. -- Sound like a candidate? Mack says the Steyer campaign is all about “doubling down, and holding the president accountable.” Stay tuned, indeed.

The only project with a Presidential Permit, full site control and full host state support, the innovative buried project will help Massachusetts meet its legislative requirements for lower carbon emissions. The entire line will travel underground and underwater, and is expected to deliver low-cost electricity to the Commonwealth over the next 40 years. Massachusetts can expect to reap $19.9 billion in benefits over the next 20 years alone, while ratepayers can expect to save $655 million a year in energy costs. Most importantly, the project is 100% privately financed and comes with a fixed-price bid, protecting taxpayers and ratepayers alike from any cost overruns. The project’s developers have also established a $20 million fund to assist low-income ratepayers in western Massachusetts.

135,TRUMP tweets ‘solidarity’ with ORANGE COUNTY -- Protesters of CLARK killing stop cars in Sacramento -- BROWN gets new ‘Deputy First Dog’ -- NEWSOM plays it safe,,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/california-playbook/2018/03/29/trump-tweets-solidarity-with-orange-county-brown-gets-new-deputy-first-dog-newsom-plays-it-safe-260553,2018-03-29T13:15:37Z,"By David Siders ( dsiders@politico.com ) and Carla Marinucci ( cmarinucci@politico.com ) with Candice Norwood ( cnorwood@politico.com ) THE BUZZ: California Republicans don’t have many reasons to celebrate these days. But President Donald Trump gave them one reason for cheer Wednesday. He tweeted, “My Administration stands in solidarity with the brave citizens in Orange County defending their rights against California’s illegal and unconstitutional Sanctuary policies. California’s Sanctuary laws release known dangerous criminals into communities across the State. All citizens have the right to be protected by Federal law and strong borders.” Story Continued Below -- Look for Republicans to push opposition to the “sanctuary state” law hard in congressional races where multiple Republicans are trying to differentiate themselves. It’s a variation on the Democrats’ game of “who opposes Trump the most.” -- “Trump tweets support after Orange County, California, opposes ‘sanctuary’ law,” by POLITICO’s Aubree Eliza Weaver: “During Tuesday’s meeting, Orange County Supervisor Michelle Steel told attendees that substantial changes to the United States’ immigration policies won’t happen overnight, and in the meantime ‘law enforcement should absolutely cooperate fully within the constraints of federal law.’” Story -- “How O.C. became a center of resistance to California's 'sanctuary state' legislation,” by Cindy Carcamo, Hailey Branson-Potts and Alene Tchekmedyian: “The stance against efforts to protect people in this country illegally comes a generation after Orange County became the birthplace of Proposition 187, the divisive 1994 ballot measure meant to cut public benefits — such as schooling and healthcare — for such residents.” Story BUENOS DÍAS, good Thursday morning. Gavin Newsom won’t debate again until May, Jerry Brown gets a new dog and Clayton Kershaw wants out of John Chiang’s latest ad. Where’s Jerry: No public schedule. BROWN’S NEW DOG: Tucked into Gov. Jerry Brown’s routine announcement of appointments Wednesday came news of a new gubernatorial dog. We’ll let the announcement speak for itself (read to the end for press office humor) … -- Cali Brown, 2 months, of Sacramento, has been appointed Deputy First Dog in the Office of Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. Born on January 26, 2018 in Herald, California, to Standard Poodle mother Bailey and Border Collie father Murphy, Cali, a Bordoodle, is without a doubt the pick of her 13-puppy litter. Cali has spent the past two months learning the ropes from a family of ranch dogs and has already shown promise in her engagement with horses, donkeys, goats, sheep and chickens. As Deputy First Dog and the newest member of the Brown family, Cali will assist First Dog Colusa Brown in herding staff at the State Capitol and will lend a paw around the family ranch in Colusa County. She will begin intensive on-the-job training with the First Dog effective immediately. This position does not require Senate confirmation — though the Deputy First Dog will gladly appear almost anywhere there are treats — and the compensation is per diem belly rubs. Cali is a Doggocrat. -- “Meet Cali, the Golden State's new 'deputy first dog',” by LATimes’ Melanie Mason: “The job responsibilities entail helping Brown’s dog Colusa, dubbed the state’s 'First Dog' in 'herding staff at the state Capitol and lending a paw around the family ranch in Colusa County,' according to the governor’s office.” Story NEWSOM PLAYING SAFE: Far ahead in the polls, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom is taking a break from gubernatorial debates. He’s getting hammered for it by his opponents, but the damage is likely to be minimal (and less than the risk of a misstep on stage). -- “Front-runner Gavin Newsom to sit out governor's race debates until May,” by LATimes’ Seema Mehta: “Gubernatorial front-runner Gavin Newsom will not participate in any more debates until early May, a spokesman for his campaign said on Wednesday.” Story CLARK PROTESTS: ""Protesters stop cars in Sacramento rush hour. Stephon Clark's body lay in open casket,"" by SacBee's Nashelly Chavez, Sam Stanton, Ed Fletcher and Hudson Sangree: ""A protest in front of the Sacramento County District Attorney's Office late Wednesday afternoon morphed into a march that blocked traffic in downtown Sacramento during the peak of the evening commute... There were tense moments as drivers leaving work tried to get by and protesters blocked them. Two buses were caught in the traffic jam. The demonstrators chanted 'Shut it down!' and 'Stephon Clark!' in protest of the police killing of Clark, a 22-year-old black man, in south Sacramento on March 18."" Story -- ""There Are Few Police Shooting Laws In California And Major Restrictions On What Officer Info Can Go Public,"" by Capital Public Radio's Ben Bradford: ""California has few laws on the books when it comes to how police departments respond to officer shootings. There are major restrictions on what type of police information can be made public. And measures or bills that would require the state to investigate police shootings have stalled in the Legislature in recent years."" Story QUOTE OF THE DAY: “No longer are public leaders constrained by the traditional media. Now, with social media, I can talk directly to the voters of California with no filter."" -- Travis Allen, via SFChronicle's Joe Garofoli TWEET OF THE DAY: Melanie Mason @melmason -- “Hello @GovPressOffice I would like to request the first exclusive interview with Cali, pls” It’s Thursday -- Got a tip?

THE TRUMP ERA: -- “Hidden Figures: How Donald Trump Is Rigging the Census,” by Ari Berman in Mother Jones: “... But with the Trump administration in charge, voting rights advocates fear the undercount could be amplified, shifting economic resources and political power toward rural, white, and Republican communities. The census is scheduled to begin on April 1, 2020, in the middle of the presidential election season. Of all the ways democracy is threatened under President Donald Trump—a blind eye to Russian meddling in elections, a rollback of voting rights, a disregard for checks and balances—an unfair and inaccurate census could have the most dramatic long-term impact.” Story -- “What courts will be looking at in judging new census question on citizenship,” by SFChronicle’s Bob Egelko and Hamed Aleaziz: “For courts considering the Trump administration’s plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, the question will be whether this is a benign inquiry designed to produce information that protects voting rights, or a politically motivated effort to depress participation in the survey — and thus congressional representation and federal funding — in immigrant-rich states like California.” Story -- “Trump has a friend in California law enforcement,” by East Bay Express’ Darwin BondGraham: “In recent years, California's police and sheriffs' departments and district attorneys have played their own role of resistance — against a wave of progressive criminal justice and immigration reforms that state voters and political leaders have embraced. Through their rank-and-file unions and statewide lobbying groups, cops and prosecutors have fought nearly every progressive criminal justice proposal and the same California pro-immigration policies that the Trump administration hopes to topple.” Story -- “Sheriff says ICE was ‘mistakenly’ allowed to see Santa Clara Co. inmates,” by Mercury News’ Robert Salonga: “In the wake of the policy violation, the Sheriff’s Office said jail deputies and staff were re-briefed of the sanctuary policies, which were developed with the aim of maintaining trust in immigrant communities and ensuring residents are not afraid to report crimes. Officials said fliers affirming the policies were posted in high-traffic areas for staff, inmates, and visitors to see.” Story -- “If China strikes back on tariffs, California tree nut exports could take a hit,” by Capital Public Radio’s Julia Mitric: “Many California farmers and wine producers see China as a growing market... And although California’s wine producers sell a smaller proportion of their total product to China than pistachio or almond growers do, they’re frustrated by the prospect of a competitive disadvantage.” Story -- “The citizen question: It is already being asked,” by Fox &amp; Hounds’ Tony Quinn: “Becerra and the state’s Democratic establishment are attacking the question because they assume it will keep illegal immigrants from filling out the census forms, thus California’s population will be undercounted and the state will lose federal benefits. This could be true, but will be very hard to prove.” Story -- “ACLU asks Greyhound to adopt sanctuary policy in face of ICE interrogations,” by SFChronicle’s Sarah Ravani and Bob Egelko: “The letter was prompted by several incidents on Greyhound premises or buses in recent months, including at least two in California. In January, Border Patrol agents boarded a Greyhound bus in Indio (Riverside County) and asked every passenger for proof of citizenship, the ACLU said.” Story CALIFORNIA AND THE CAPITOL CORRIDOR: -- “UC schools reject March For Our Lives leader David Hogg,” by Pueng Vongs: “Hogg, originally from Los Angeles, was rejected by all four University of California schools he applied to for undergraduate admission. These included: UCLA, UCSD, UCSB and UC Irvine, reports TMZ.com.” Story -- “Fight to resume executions in California clears 1 hurdle,” by AP’s Don Thompson: “A judge on Tuesday lifted his own court's previous order blocking California from carrying out death sentences by lethal injection, but the decision is far from the final word on the contentious issue because of several ongoing lawsuits.” Story -- “#MeToo assemblywoman defends herself against harassment allegations, but comments spark backlash,” by Capital Public Radio’s Ben Adler: “Asm. Cristina Garcia (D-Bell Gardens) denies that she grabbed a man’s crotch — and that she forced staffers to play ‘spin the bottle’ with her. But when asked whether she referred to former Assembly Speaker John Pérez as a ‘homo,’ she acknowledged having used that word in the past — though didn’t remember if she used it about Pérez, who is gay.” Story -- “California Legislature will 'proactively' release records on substantiated sexual harassment complaints,” by LATimes’ Melanie Mason: “The Capitol Correspondents Assn. of California reached out to legislative leaders earlier this month with concerns about inconsistencies in how the Legislature was releasing records under the Legislative Open Records Act. After releasing a decade’s worth of records on sexual harassment investigations in February, both houses offered conflicting guidance on how journalists could obtain records from recent probes.” Story -- “Southern California might foot the bill for delta tunnels project — with no promise of reimbursement,” by LATimes’ Bettina Boxall: “At a board workshop Tuesday, officials of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California outlined ways in which the agency could finance the construction of two giant water tunnels under the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.” Story -- “A California sheriff is skirting state ‘sanctuary’ laws to help ICE capture undocumented immigrants,” by WashPost’s Alex Horton: “The move comes as California battles the federal government over how local authorities cooperate with federal immigration agencies. SB54 came into effect Jan. 1 amid intense criticism by the Trump administration over sanctuary policies that shield immigrants from increased risk of detention by ICE. On March 6, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against the state, alleging that a trio of state laws, including SB54, violate the Constitution.” Story CAMPAIGNS 2018 AND BEYOND: -- “Clayton Kershaw wants out of John Chiang’s campaign ad. Chiang team says no,” by SFChronicle’s Matier &amp; Ross: “The Los Angeles Dodgers pitching ace, who will take the mound Thursday for the season opener against the Giants, pops up in a new Internet ad in which Chiang says a workplace retirement savings program he came up with has helped ‘retire more people than Clayton Kershaw’s curveball.’” Story -- “Gun violence has defined Sen. Dianne Feinstein's political career. The issue is more important than ever for her now,” by LATimes’ Seema Mehta: “The focus on gun control comes at an opportune time for Feinstein. In her bid for a fifth full term, she is facing a challenge on her left flank. Her moderation has irked the most liberal members of her party's base, as seen in her failure to come close to obtaining the California Democratic Party's endorsement last month.” Story -- “Commentary: Feinstein leads in Senate race but is dodging bullets from the left,” by CALmatters’ Dan Walters: “Republicans may have finally given up hope of claiming her seat, but the left-wingers, who have never liked her pragmatic approach, are incensed by her seeming unwillingness to fully embrace “the resistance” to President Donald Trump—even, at one point, suggesting that he could evolve into a good president.” Story -- “Dumanis gave to charity, says $15,000 in donations covers tainted campaign contributions,” by Andrew Dyer for San Diego Union-Tribune: “County Board of Supervisors candidate Bonnie Dumanis has given $15,000 to a community safety fund over the past three years and is offering receipts from the charitable donations as evidence that she has unloaded any tainted money from a federal campaign-finance case.” Story -- “Cheaper California housing? One idea to lower costs makes candidates for governor uneasy,” by SacBee’s Angela Hart: “It’s a controversial idea that advocates say could help alleviate California's worsening housing crisis: strip cities of some of their zoning authority to unleash an enormous amount of new construction.” Story MIXTAPE: -- “O.C. pushes homeless off the street but can't find anywhere to shelter them,” by LATimes’ Anh Do, Cindy Carcamo and Joseph Serna: Story -- “Race to unlock San Bernardino shooter's iPhone was delayed by poor FBI communication, report finds,” by LATimes’ Joseph Tanfani: Story -- “Tesla shares drop as questions around fatal Model X crash in California continue to swirl,” by the Toronto Star: Story -- “County to explore installing 'Stop the Bleed' kits for victims of mass shootings, other emergencies,” by San Diego Union-Tribune’s Lyndsay Winkley: Story -- “Mexico pledges $4.3 Million effort to stop tijuana spills,” by AP: Story -- “Has California’s homeless population ‘skyrocketed’? And how does it rate nationwide?” by Politifact’s Chris Nichols: Story CANNABIS COUNTRY: -- “Chronic problems cast cloud over California's marijuana Mecca,” by Fortune’s Chris Morris: “The sale, says American Green, includes a provision that it continue the transformation efforts of the 80-acre town. It says it has signed a contract to develop the town for the next five to10 years.” Story -- “California regulators target web ads for illegal pot shops,” by AP’s Michael R. Blood: “legal and illegal operators advertise next to each other, and licensed operators in California say that's put them at a disadvantage in a cutthroat marketplace.” Story HOLLYWOODLAND: -- “Stars of 'Veep,' 'West Wing' to lobby lawmakers ahead of White House correspondents' dinner,” by the Hill’s Judy Kurtz: “Richard Schiff, who played White House communications director Toby Ziegler on NBC’s ‘The West Wing,’ and Reid Scott, who plays a former deputy communications director on HBO’s ‘Veep,’ are some of the entertainers leading a lobbying push on Capitol Hill on the eve of the April 28 dinner.” Story -- “Is Hollywood violence to blame for mass shootings? ‘It’s a really complex question’,” by LA Daily News’ Bob Strauss: “More scientific research indicates media violence may move some to act out the real thing, but a causal contribution of watching a ‘Game of Thrones’ bloodbath to unloading an AR-15 in class isn’t close to being proven.” Story SILICON VALLEYLAND:’ -- “Uber puts the brakes on testing robot cars in California after Arizona fatality,” by SFChronicle’s Carolyn Said: “The move follows a March 18 crash in Tempe, Ariz., in which an Uber car operating in autonomous mode struck and killed a pedestrian. After that fatality, the ride-hailing company temporarily suspended its driverless car testing in Tempe, Pittsburgh, Toronto and San Francisco, the four cities where it operates the cars.” Story -- “Uber to pay $10 million over claims it paid women, minority engineers less,” by Mercury News’ Ethan Baron: “The lawsuit, filed by two Latina software engineers on behalf of 420 workers, alleges that Uber paid women and minorities in certain jobs less than white or Asian men for equal work, hired them at lower-level positions than appropriate, promoted them more slowly and gave them “systematically biased” performance reviews.” Story -- “Is it even possible to protect your privacy on Facebook?” by NPR’s Laura Sydell: “Shanna Carlile-Roy, a part time student living in a remote area of northern California, is on Facebook, but she's uncomfortable with its privacy policies. Yet she stays on the site. ""I feel trapped with the site because it's such a form of connection that I've become dependent on,"" she says.” Story ENDORSEMENTS -- First in Playbook -- Former Rep. Tony Coelho is endorsing Vivek Viswanathan for state treasurer … Equality California has endorsed state Assemblywoman Catharine Baker in AD-16 and dual endorsed state Assemblyman Brian Maienschein and his Democratic challenger Sunday Gover in AD-77.

136,CHRIS CHRISTIE for attorney general (of Alabama) — MENENDEZ-allied clergy slam DOJ over prayer motion — TRENTON THUNDER to become Trenton Pork Roll,,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/new-jersey-playbook/2018/01/26/chris-christie-for-attorney-general-of-alabama-menendez-allied-clergy-slam-doj-over-prayer-motion-trenton-thunder-to-become-trenton-pork-roll-240428,2018-01-26T12:15:27Z,"By Matt Friedman ( mfriedman@politico.com ; @mattfriedmannj ) Good Friday morning! Story Continued Below Chris Christie could be the next attorney general … of Alabama. Well, that’s if that deeply red state’s voters elect a Democrat. Because the Chris Christie who’s running for attorney general there is actually a Democrat. And technically, his first name is James. Which was almost Gov. Christie’s first name, but wound up being his middle name. Anyway, I talked to the other Chris Christie yesterday. He calls himself the “original” Chris Christie since he was born three years before our former governor. You can read all about it here. WHERE’S MURPHY? At the YMCA in Trenton for an 11 am “gun safety announcement” QUOTE OF THE DAY: ” The open secret known by every single member of the City Council and alluded to in multiple local news reports is that there is massive vote-buying that occurs in our elections. Reducing voter turnout through runoffs in December will amplify the power of those vote-buying operations, making our elections less democratic. Therefore, the approach taken by the City Council in achieving this objective is highly misguided and amounts to poor public policy that I cannot support. A far better approach, which I fully support, is to move to instant runoff (also known as ranked choice) voting which is commonplace around the country.” Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla’s veto of a ballot question on runoffs (some background ) HAPPY BIRTHDAY — U.S. Rep. Albio Sires, News 12’s Jeremy Settle, Murphy aide/bush hider Robert Field, Dow Jones’ Heather Taylor. Saturday for Senate Dems’ Nancy Youngkin, University Hospital’s Ryan Goodwin.

Players will wear special uniforms featuring the pork-based product, that's also known as Taylor ham. Concessions will sell pork roll sandwiches and pork roll-themed merchandise will be for sale.” Read the report 13 MASTRO DECLINE — “Lottery ticket sales plummeted last year, breaking a seven-year winning streak,” by The Record’s Dustin Racioppi: “New Jersey's lottery lost more than $100 million in ticket sales last year, ending a streak of record sales that began before its core operations were privatized in a controversial deal pushed through by former Republican Gov. Chris Christie. Despite the drop in ticket sales in the 2017 fiscal year that ended June 30, the lottery contributed more money than it had the previous year to education and social service programs: $994 million, compared to $987 million in the 2016 fiscal year, according to its annual report. The private operator of the lottery, Northstar New Jersey, was awarded $103 million in fees and expenses, $1 million less than it earned the previous year, the report said.” Read the report ICE ICE MAYBE — Murphy, in visit to sanctuary church, weighs options to fight ICE deportations raids, by POLITICO's Katie Jennings: Gov. Phil Murphy made an unplanned visit to a local church Thursday to pledge his support for longtime borough resident Harry Pangemanan, who was seeking sanctuary from deportation several hours after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents showed up at his house. “Answering something with nothing is not an option,” Murphy said as he stood outside the Reformed Church of Highland Park, which is run by pastor Seth Kaper-Dale, a longtime immigration advocate and former Green Party candidate for governor. Murphy rushed to Highland Park following a planned tour of a medical marijuana dispensary in Cranbury after hearing reports about Pangemanan seeking refuge in the church and the detainment of two other men — Roby Sanger and Gunawan Liem — who Kaper-Dale said were detained by ICE agents Thursday morning as they dropped their children off at school in Metuchen and Franklin Park. Read the report BEST ‘HOW IT’S MADE’ EPISODE EVER — “Following order on medical marijuana program, Murphy gets up-close look of how it works,” by The Record’s Dustin Racioppi: “Gov. Phil Murphy visited a medical marijuana dispensary on Thursday, following up his order to study the state's program with an up-close look at it in action. Murphy toured the Breakwater Treatment and Wellness center in Cranbury, one of the state's five medical marijuana dispensaries. With a skunky scent in the air and a lobby full of patients waiting to enter, Murphy faced a small room of glass pipes, oils and displays of packaged marijuana strains with names like Cannatonic, AK-47 and Grape Ape and touted the benefits of medical marijuana while lamenting New Jersey's slow progress to open it to more people. ‘This is a life or death reality for too many folks,’ Murphy told reporters, who were not allowed on the tour, in a brief news conference afterward. ‘There are too many people who are suffering.’” Read the report ENERGY — “Nuclear subsidy bill gets renewable energy makeover, but still sparks backlash,” by POLITICO’s Danielle Muoio : “Just a few hours before the state Senate environmental panel was scheduled to meet, lawmakers scrambled to add clean energy provisions to a controversial nuclear subsidy bill. The bill, NJ S887 (18R), underwent an overhaul Thursday morning to include provisions for offshore wind, solar and energy efficiency. But the core substance of the bill remains the same: It would allow owners of nuclear plants to apply for a subsidy that amounts to $300 million annually. The subsidy would be paid through charges on ratepayers’ bills. The 50-page legislation only went up for discussion in front of the Senate Environment and Energy Committee. It will go in front of the Budget and Appropriations Committee on Feb. 5.” Read the report R.I.P. — “Rest in peace, Rich Dennison of Florence,” from InsiderNJ: “Rich Dennison, an attorney and funeral home director in his hometown of Florence, has died at the age of 40, according to a post by his relatives on Facebook. ‘I am sad to announce that Rich passed away peacefully in his sleep on Monday evening from a pre-existing heart condition,’ said Doreen and Stacey Dennison. ‘We are in the process of making arrangements and will post again as soon as we know the details of when the services will be.’ An impassioned citizen, Mr. Dennison loved debate, discussion and the fiber of politics. He got in his start in the government and politics arena when he interned in the Clinton White House as a speechwriter.

Bob Menendez during his corruption trial last year could have influenced the jury. “We have a government now that I’m very suspect of. They’re in the news every day, and not in the news in a positive way,” said the Rev. Ronald L. Owens of the New Hope Baptist Church in Metuchen, who is also a spokesman for the progressive N.J. Clergy Coalition for Justice. “And now we have a DOJ that wants to now crucify one of the outspoken senators.” Read the report SENATE — Murray Sabrin, the Libertarian-turned-Republican who ran a few times for Senate and governor, is planning to run for Senate again. And he’s a Libertarian again. “After weighing the pros and cons of becoming a candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2018 with my wife and many close friends and colleagues, I decided on Tuesday to seek the Libertarian Party’s nomination at the March 24th convention, which will be held at Rutgers University,” Sabrin wrote in an email Thursday. “If I am successful at the convention, we will have the most out-of-the-box U.S. Senate campaign in the history of New Jersey and possibly U.S. history. His first statewide run was in 1997, when he qualified for matching funds as a Libertarian — the first third-party candidate in state history to do so. He got about 5 percent of the vote.

McDonald: “The first ex-Jersey City cop to face sentencing in a wide-ranging federal probe of the police department was spared prison today, with a judge handing out a punishment of three years' probation to the former police officer. Christopher Ortega, 30, was facing as many as five years in prison for the conspiracy to commit fraud charge, but U.S. District Judge John Michael Vazquez argued that a less severe sentence was appropriate because Ortega accepted responsibility for his crimes, did not blame anyone else for them and is unlikely to re-offend. Ortega admitted last year that he submitted phony pay vouchers to the city for 10 months starting in 2014, collecting more than $18,000 for off-duty jobs he never performed.” Read the report BHALLA.

The town settled a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the Harden family for $350,000 in November 2017. The town made no admission of wrongdoing in the settlement.

137,"MARIJUANA could be $1 billion cash crop for NJ, law firm says — REDD in line for lucrative job —TRUMP administration’s GATEWAY negotiating tactic",,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/new-jersey-playbook/2018/01/03/redd-in-line-for-lucrative-job-trump-administrations-gateway-negotiating-tactic-law-firm-marijuana-could-be-1-billion-cash-crop-for-nj-234476,2018-01-03T12:15:27Z,"By Matt Friedman ( mfriedman@politico.com ; @mattfriedmannj ) Good Wednesday morning! Story Continued Below If you’re at all familiar with the ways of Trenton, you know that one of the easiest ways to put off facing a difficult problem is to form a commission to study it. Usually after a long period, that commission will release a report on that problem. Yesterday we saw the product of that Trenton strategy. The interest arbitration cap expired, and our own Katherine Landergan found out that the “task force” charged with evaluating the cap won’t release a report — even though Gov. Chris Christie’s appointees on the board already put out their own report. There’s a new governor coming in, but it’s the same town. WHERE’S CHRISTIE? No public schedule WHERE’S MURPHY? In Lawrenceville at 11 am to announce his choice for health commissioner HAPPY BIRTHDAY — State Sen. Jennifer Beck, Assemblywoman Gabriela Mosquera, Singleton COS Hilary Beckett, Assembly Dem staffer Andrea Katz, HCANJ's John Indyk QUOTE OF THE DAY: “Actually, it's @USDOT, @FAANews, &amp; @NASA —and especially the airlines— who deserve credit for this. But, if you're going to take credit for zero airline deaths in 2017 then you should take responsibility for the tens of thousands of gun deaths, too. #lawsmatter” — West Orange native Mark Kelly, an astronaut and husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, on President Trump taking credit for the worldwide lack of commercial jet passenger deaths last year WHAT TRENTON MADE REDD TO MAKE GREEN — “Former Camden mayor may be in line for lucrative public job,” by POLITICO’s Matt Friedman: “ Former Camden Mayor Dana Redd, who left office Monday, may be in for a lucrative landing — just as the state Legislature is rushing through a bill that would improve her pension. Redd is a leading candidate to become CEO of the Rowan University/Rutgers-Camden Board of Governors, according to two sources with knowledge of the potential hire. Redd is currently an unpaid member of the board. It is not clear what her salary would be if she becomes CEO. The current CEO, Kris Kolluri — who, like Redd, is a longtime ally of South Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross — was hired in 2014 at a salary of $275,000.” Read the report OFF THE RAILS — “Gateway, Trump and the Schumer factor,” by POLITICO’s Dana Rubinstein and Ryan Hutchins: “Fourteen months ago, New York’s senior U.S. senator made one thing clear: federal funding for a new rail tunnel beneath the Hudson River was, to him, a do-or-die proposition. But November 2016 did not go as planned, Schumer voted against President Donald Trump's transportation pick, and now Schumer — and the region — are facing a potential infrastructure crisis whose solution may hinge on the senator and his relationship with the president. F ew moments may better illustrate the situation than what occurred on Friday, when a top federal transportation official wrote a strongly-worded letter that disavowed an Obama-era deal in which the federal government, Amtrak, New York and New Jersey were to split the $13 billion cost of building a new tunnel. And now Schumer, perhaps more than anyone else involved, is left to chart a course forward for the massive project, known as Gateway. Some involved say Friday’s letter is about much more than the tunnel. ‘Part of what's going on is the president positioning himself with regard to Senator Schumer,’ said one official close to the project. According to that official, local leaders are now working under the assumption that Trump will use Gateway as leverage in negotiations with Schumer over the president’s still-impending infrastructure plan, among other things.” Read the report —“Did Trump kill the plan for a Hudson rail tunnel? Its backers hope not” Read the report IF WE DON’T GIVE BEZOS A TAX BREAK MAYBE TRUMP WILL PAY FOR THE GATEWAY TUNNEL — “Lawmakers poised to vote on $5B Amazon tax credit,” by POLITICO's Ryan Hutchins and Katherine Landergan: “State lawmakers plan to vote this week on newly introduced legislation that would offer Amazon the chance to earn a $5 billion tax break if it builds a new headquarters in New Jersey, potentially delivering a big lame-duck win as Gov. Chris Christie prepares to leave office. The Senate is scheduled to hold a Thursday vote on the legislation, which was introduced late last month and appears to be on track for final passage before the two-year session ends next week. It isn't certain whether Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto will allow a vote in the lower house, but he previously signed a letter backing the broad outlines of the proposal. Under the new bill, Amazon would be required to create at least 30,000 jobs and make $3 billion in capital investments to qualify for the incentive program. Amazon has said it plans to create 50,000 new jobs when it builds its new headquarters.” Read the report — “Labor unions hoping for a 'brighter opportunity' under Murphy,” by POLITICO’s Katherine Landergan: “Murphy, now the governor-elect, ran a progressive campaign against Republican Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, advocating for union rights and aligning many of his platform proposals with some of the state's most powerful labor groups. Along the way, he scooped up endorsements from more than 50 labor organizations and collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions from them. As Murphy prepares to take the reins from Republican Gov. Chris Christie in two weeks, top union officials are hoping the candidate they supported in a big way will come through for them, even though they acknowledge that getting everything they want won't be easy. In a series of interviews with POLITICO, several of New Jersey's top union leaders said they were relieved that Christie — with whom some had a contentious relationship — was leaving office. The Murphy administration, they said, offers an opportunity to accomplish things that weren't possible over the past eight years, such as raising the state’s minimum wage to $15 or fully funding the school aid formula. For some labor leaders, the most immediate benefit of having Murphy in the governor's office will be a likely shift in tone.” Read the report $300 MILLION ISN'T COOL. YOU KNOW WHAT'S COOL? $1 BILLION — “A $1 billion marijuana windfall for New Jersey? Some say it's possible,” by The Record’s James Nash : “New Jersey could reap as much as $1 billion a year from legal marijuana — the equivalent of more than a half-cent boost in the sales tax — if the state taxes the industry aggressively and imposes fees on growers, distributors, testing labs, retailers and delivery services, according to projections by a law firm. The conclusion illustrates the stakes faced by Phil Murphy, who campaigned for legal recreational use in his bid for governor. The incoming governor is seeking a windfall to pay for big-ticket items like free community college for residents. However, representatives of the nascent industry caution that a heavy-handed approach from Trenton could stifle business, keeping much of marijuana production and distribution underground and untaxed. The $1 billion estimate came from the Roseland law firm of Brach Eichler, which has two lawyers on Murphy's healthcare transition committee.” Read the report RUSSELL THE POLITICAL MUSCLE — “Russell co-founds new NJ-NY political consulting firm, taps Kean’s Neely as veep,” from Save Jersey: “ Veteran New Jersey GOP strategist Chris Russell is kicking off 2018 with a new endeavor, Save Jerseyans: a new political consulting firm called ‘Checkmate Strategies.’ New York operative Michael Lawler is Russell’s partner for Checkmate, and the Tuesday morning roll out for the new organization, with offices in New Jersey and New York, included an announcement that former Tom MacArthur campaign manager and right-hand man for NJ Senate Republican Leader Tom Kean, Jr., Harrison Neely, would serve as a senior vice-president.” Read the report DON’T SPEND IT ALL IN ONE PLACE — “7 Jersey law changes that could affect you just came in with the new year,” by NJ Advance Media’s Samantha Marcus: “1.

Effective as of Jan. 1, the sales tax in New Jersey dropped from 6.875 to 6.625 percent as a result of an agreement reached last year as part of the gas tax being signed into law.” Read the report —""Will New Year’s New Tax Cuts Hit New Jersey’s Budget and New Governor’s Plans?"" by NJ Spotlight's John Reitmeyer: “New Jersey is known around the country for having high taxes, but for the second year in a row a series of tax cuts just went into effect at the start of a new year. This year’s cuts include a slight reduction of the general sales tax, and the outright elimination of the estate tax. … [O]ne area where the tax cuts are expected to have a big impact is on the cash-starved state budget, with projections for the current fiscal year suggesting the tax cuts are costing roughly $500 million in lost revenue. That total is projected to double to around $1 billion during the state’s next fiscal year. With Democratic Gov.-elect Phil Murphy getting ready to replace the Republican Christie later this month, the impact of the tax cuts could put pressure on the new governor to eventually reverse them, especially if the fiscal projections he’s inheriting from Christie fail to come through.” Read the report —""NJSPCA officials encouraged sending fake emails to lawmakers” Read the report —“5 winners, 5 losers of 2017 in N.J. politics | Opinion” Read the op-ed —“Christie administration awards $30M for integrated opioid treatment” Read the report —“Burzichelli and NJSIAA at odds over legislation NJSIAA officials believe may create 'all-star teams' ” Read the report THE TRUMP ERA R.I.P. — “US soldier killed in combat in Afghanistan,” by The AP: “ The U.S. military says an American soldier has been killed fighting in eastern Afghanistan.

Chris Christie to privatize the state facility before he leaves office. Fulop announced the lawsuit at a press conference in Jersey City Hall Chambers. He promised in early December that he would file suit if the state Department of Environmental Protection moved ahead with plans to lease 45 acres on the southern end of Liberty State Park to Suntex Marinas, a private company. Suntex has accepted the terms of the DEP lease, but has yet to sign it. The company must hold a public information session before the end of January now that it has agreed to terms of the lease. The lawsuit, filed in Superior Court in Hudson County, calls for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to stop any further action. Fulop tweeted Tuesday night that the court had granted the temporary restraining order, which ensures the lease won't be signed before an injunction hearing is held.” Read the report — @StevenFulop : “Ahhh - Justice.

Perillo officially assumed the position Tuesday evening during his swearing-in ceremony, where state Senator-Elect Vin Gopal, D-11, administered the oath. Politics in Tinton Falls are nonpartisan, but Perillo is a registered Republican, according to voter registration records. At 93, Perillo is not the oldest mayor in the United States.

139,Roundup Weed Killer Chemical Found in Cheerios and Quaker Oats,"Kind and Nature Valley bars, too.",http://fortune.com/2018/08/15/roundup-in-cheerios-weed-killer/,2018-08-15 14:27:47,"If you or your children are eating Cheerios right now, there’s a good chance that they’re accompanied by a potentially harmful weed killer called Roundup.

The Environmental Working Group, a Washington, D.C. advocacy group that assesses chemicals in consumer products, on Wednesday released the results of a test it conducted on popular oat-based products, like Cheerios, Lucky Charms, Kind Bars, Nature Valley bars, and others, to determine whether they contained any of the herbicide glyphosate. Glyphosate is the active ingredient in Monsanto’s Roundup weed killer, and at high levels, has been linked to cancer.

Unfortunately, some of the results were not what you might hope.

In its testing, the EWG tested 45 samples of conventionally grown oats and 16 of organically grown oats. In 43 of the 45 conventional cases, it detected glyphosate. And in 31 of those cases, glyphosate levels were above the organization’s health benchmark of 160 parts per billion. On the organic side, just five products were discovered to have had Glyphosate and none of them reached the 160ppb benchmark.

The benchmark is designed to provide a framework for how much glyphosate humans can ingest daily without having potentially negative health effects. The higher the level, the worse for your health.

The most concerning findings came with Quaker Old Fashioned Oats, which had levels higher than 1,000ppb. Three Cheerios samples had levels ranging from 470ppb to 530ppb. Lucky Charms were tested in two samples and found to have 400ppb and 230ppb levels, respectively.

“We proudly stand by the safety and quality of our Quaker products,” the company replied in a statement. “Quaker does not add glyphosate during any part of the milling process. Glyphosate is commonly used by farmers across the industry who apply it pre-harvest.” It added that the reported levels of the chemical “are significantly below any regulatory limits” and compliance standards for human consumption.

Kind Vanilla, Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds had levels of 50ppb and 60ppb in the testing, below the 160ppb benchmark. The company’s Kind Oats & Honey with Toasted Coconut Bar reported no glyphosate in the first test, but 120ppb in the second.

Nature Valley’s Granola Protein Oats ‘n Honey had 220ppb and 170ppb in its two tests, respectively. The company’s Cunchy Granola Bars, Oats ‘n Honey had 340ppb and 120ppb in its two tests.

Some organic options proved to be the healthiest. Simple Truth Organic Instant Oatmeal, for instance, didn’t have the chemical in its oats. The same was true for Kashi’s Heart to Heart Organic Honey Toasted cereal. And if you’re looking for a healthy granola bar that doesn’t contain glyphosate, according to EWG, opt for the Cascadian Farm Organic Harvest Berry.

Glyphosate has long been a major concern for health advocates. Both the World Health Organization and California state scientists have found links between the herbicide and cancer.

Monsanto’s Roundup, meanwhile, is the most heavily used pesticide in the U.S. It’s estimated that 250 million pounds of Roundup are sprayed on American crops to keep weeds down and crops living. But since it’s often sprayed before harvest, it clings to the crops, leaving them in food.

According to EWG, glyphosate is an especially concerning problem for children. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, for instance, has found that children between the ages of one and two have much higher exposure than older people. Their daily glyphosate intake is estimated at 230 times the 160ppb benchmark, according to EWG.

Monsanto did not immediately respond to a Fortune request for comment on the findings.

The rules, which go into effect for this year’s deer-hunting season, will pose new restrictions on baiting and feeding.

Among the regulations will be a statewide ban on the use of all natural cervid urine-based lures, and an immediate ban on baiting and feeding in the 16 counties that make up the Chronic Wasting Disease Management Zone, according to the state’s website.

CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE THREATENS DEER POPULATION, HUNTING SEASON

Chronic wasting disease affects deer, elk and moose and has been spreading across counties in Michigan since it was discovered in a free-ranging deer in May 2015, Michigan Live reported. Though there have been no reported cases of humans contracting the fatal disease, hunters are advised against consuming meat from animals with symptoms.

There is no cure for the disease.

DEER HUNTING TIPS: 6 WAYS TO FIND A BUCK YOU ALREADY SCARED OFF

The rest of the state's regulations are listed below:

Reduced the 4-point on-a-side antler requirement on the restricted tag of the combination license in the 16-county CWD Management Zone. Under the new regulation, a hunter in the CWD Management Zone can use the restricted tag of the combination license to harvest a buck with antlers as long as it has at least one 3-inch antler.

Created a discounted antlerless license opportunity in the CWD Management Zone on private land; if purchased, the license will expire Nov. 4, 2018.

Effectively immediately, a statewide ban on the use of all natural cervid urine-based lures and attractants, except for lures that are approved by the Archery Trade Association.

An immediate ban on baiting and feeding in the 16-county area identified as the CWD Management Zone. This area includes Calhoun, Clinton, Eaton, Gratiot, Hillsdale, Ingham, Ionia, Isabella, Jackson, Kent, Mecosta, Montcalm, Muskegon, Newaygo, Ottawa and Shiawassee counties.

A ban on baiting and feeding in the Lower Peninsula, effective Jan. 31, 2019, with an exception to this ban for hunters with disabilities who meet specific requirements. The start date on this regulation is intended to allow bait producers and retailers time to adjust to the new rule.

Effective immediately in the CWD Management Zone and four-county bovine tuberculosis area (in Alcona, Alpena, Montmorency and Oscoda counties), hunters with disabilities who meet specific requirements can now use 2 gallons of single-bite bait, such as shelled corn, during the Liberty and Independence hunts.

Allowance of all legal firearms to be used in muzzleloader season in the CWD Management Zone.

A purchase limit of 10 private-land antlerless licenses per hunter in the CWD Management Zone.

Restrictions on deer carcass movement in the five-county CWD Core Area (Ionia, Kent, Mecosta, Montcalm and Newaygo counties) and the CWD Management Zone.

Antlerless options on deer licenses/combo licenses during firearms seasons in the five-county CWD Core Area.

Expansion of early and late antlerless seasons in select counties.

141,Trade war fallout: Soybean prices plunge to a 10-year low,"Soybean prices have hit a 10-year low, dealing a blow to American farmers.",https://money.cnn.com/2018/07/11/news/economy/soybean-prices/index.html,2018-07-11 15:43:32,"Soybean prices have hit a 10-year low, dealing a blow to American farmers.

The price of a bushel slid to $8.55 on Wednesday, a 13% decline since the beginning of the year. Prices are falling as a result of the escalating trade war between the United States and China.

The United States imposed a 25% tariff last week on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods. China responded with a tariff on American goods worth an equal amount, including soybeans.

China is the world's largest buyer of American soybeans. Farmers in the United States sell about a third of their harvest there. Soybeans are used both for cooking and for feeding livestock.

Farmers have warned the Trump administration that the trade barrier will hurt them.

Related: US soybean farmers say China tariffs could result in 'serious damage'

""The math is simple. You tax soybean exports at 25%, and you have serious damage to US farmers,"" John Heisdorffer, a soybean grower from Iowa, said in a statement last week.

The Trump administration has pledged to protect American farmers, but hasn't provided details.

Senior administration officials said Tuesday on a call with reporters that agricultural exports are holding up ""quite well"" under tariffs, and that the administration is taking concerns from the agricultural community ""very seriously.""

""With respect to the agricultural community, that's a community that understands they're not being treated fairly by China either,"" one senior official said.

But as Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at the Bleakley Advisory Group, wrote in a client note: ""Someone go tell the American farmer who will be harvesting their crop in a few months that this is all part of the negotiating process.""

U.S. farmers will become eligible by September at the earliest for the first payments of a $12 billion subsidy program designed to shield them from a burgeoning trade war starting, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said.

“The mitigation payments will be eligible in September in some degree and into October and the fall,” Perdue said on the sidelines of an event at the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires. “It depends on when the farmer comes in and applies.”

U.S. President Donald Trump announced the subsidy this week as he sought to ease anxiety among farmers who feel they will be shut out of important markets in Asia. Trump has applied tariffs to steel and aluminum imports, threatened to place tariffs on vehicles made in the EU and said he will place levies on $500 billion of Chinese imports. All these measures have heightened tension that a burgeoning trade war may dampen global growth.

The U.S. soybean harvest is from September to November. Money for the payments will be tapped from programs already authorized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Perdue said. The subsidies would be for the 2018 crop season only because farmers couldn’t have foreseen current global trade feuding when they planted. In 2019, he added, growers won’t need the help as they’ll adapt their sowing plans to market conditions.

“It’s a one-time effort,” he said.

Farmers have a “legitimate anxiety” of losing export markets permanently should the trade war drag on for months or years, especially with South American supplies from Argentina and Brazil able to fill some of the void, Perdue said.

“But I hope it doesn’t go on that long,” he said. “The U.S. desire for global trade is to remove all tariff and non-tariff barriers. So, we hope to have all these little disputes resolved very quickly.”

Perdue was speaking at an event to celebrate the recent entry of U.S. pork into the Argentina after he met for two days in Buenos Aires with global counterparts from the Group of 20 nations. He pointed to the pork exports as a good example of free trade the G20 is seeking to promote.

He said an agreement in the works with Mexico on NAFTA should be reached “very soon”. Perdue’s Mexican counterpart Baltazar Hinojosa Ochoa said on Friday he saw talks closing within two months, even as Mexico looks to Argentina to diversify its corn and wheat supplies that currently come almost entirely from the U.S.

It’s down to the European Union to come up with a way of ensuring private buyers increase soybean purchases from the U.S. after the measure was included as part of a trade-war ceasefire, Perdue said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sweden’s government unveiled a 1.2 billion-krona ($137 million) package to help farmers amid a record heat wave and dry-spell across the Nordic country.

The government will seek to pay out an immediate 400 million kronor in aid this year and an additional 760 million kronor next year. It will also seek increased aid from the European Union.

“A national support package for Sweden’s farmers is not only important for those affected but also to strengthen our food supply,” Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson said at a press conference in Stockholm.

Sweden has been hit by massive forest fires and a persistent drought amid near record high temperatures.

This is Ocean Farm 1, the world’s first deep-sea aquaculture project, designed by leading salmon farmer SalMar ASA. The company paid China Shipbuilding Industry Corp. $300 million upfront for six facilities that offer more space than conventional shoreline farms (large nets in sheltered waters) while diffusing fish waste, allowing them to be packed in tighter.

How It Works

Oxygen sensors and high-definition cameras monitor the salmon for, among other things, growth and signs of illness. Midway through Ocean Farm 1’s yearlong trial run, SalMar says it’s seen strong growth and low mortality rates.

Sixteen movable, submerged valves disperse food at set times and allow fish to live at depths of up to 180 feet, rather than clustering them near the surface, as in other farms.

Next Steps

SalMar plans to harvest the farm’s first generation of salmon in the second half of the year and says that if the development phase is successful, it’ll be possible to establish fish farming anywhere in the open sea. The company says OF1 can withstand devastating waves, on the order of 50 feet.

One drawback: Packing so many fish so closely together heightens the risk of widespread disease if even a few get sick. It also forces the salmon to stay in much deeper water with less oxygen than they’re used to, which limits their growth, according to Tim Dempster, a marine ecologist and professor of biosciences at the University of Melbourne.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
145,Tyson Foods Blames Trade War as It Cuts 2018 Profit Forecast,"Tyson Foods Inc., the largest U.S. meat producer, blamed the country’s escalating trade dispute as it cut its full-year profit forecast.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-30/tyson-foods-blames-trade-policy-as-it-cuts-2018-profit-forecast,2018-07-30 13:15:18,"LISTEN TO ARTICLE 2:59 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email

Tyson Foods Inc.., the largest U.S.-based meat producer, said profit this year will be less than it previously forecast because of the country’s escalating trade dispute with major importers of agricultural products.

Both China and Mexico have imposed import tariffs on American pork recently in retaliation against U.S. duties on metal shipments. The measures have sent hog prices plunging, eroding the profitability at Tyson’s pork business. The Springdale, Arkansas-based company said Monday it’s also grappling with higher commodity-market volatility and ""sluggish"" domestic demand for chicken.

""The combination of changing global trade policies here and abroad, and the uncertainty of any resolution, have created a challenging market environment of increased volatility, lower prices and oversupply of protein,"" Chief Executive Officer Tom Hayes said in a statement.

The American farm sector is one of the few areas of the economy that typically operates with a trade surplus, and agriculture groups have sounded off against the trade war’s potential toll on exports. Net farm income is poised to reach a 12-year low in 2018, and challenges for meat demand may offset some of the benefits of cheaper feed-grain prices. The Trump administration last week announced a plan to provide $12 billion in assistance to U.S. farmers.

Tyson said its earnings in fiscal 2018 excluding one-time items will be about $5.70 to $6 a share, compared with a previous view of $6.55 to $6.70.

The shares slumped as much as 8.2 percent, the biggest intraday drop since November 2016. They were down 5.5 percent at $60.04 at 10:49 a.m. in New York. Rival poultry producers Pilgrim’s Pride Corp. and Sanderson Farms Inc., and Hormel Foods Corp., which processes pork, declined.

Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research Group, the lone analyst tracked by Bloomberg holding a sell rating on Tyson, lowered his price target for the shares to $40 from $55.

“We won’t really know for several quarters the full magnitude of the impacts of the Chinese tariffs, if any, but the direction of the impact is clear -- higher risk to the sanguine earnings outlook,” Ramey said in a report.

The trade challenges come amid a surge in U.S. meat production, making exports increasingly vital to offload surpluses. American output of red meat and poultry is expected to reach an all-time high and swell further in 2019. Wholesale chicken breast prices are the cheapest for this time of year since at least 2010 and pork is at a seasonal nine-year low, government data show.

“Through pricing and aggressive cost management, we’re working to stabilize the impact of freight and feed ingredient costs,"" Hayes said. ""However, we still face pressure on chicken sales volume and pricing due to the abundance of relatively low-priced beef and pork on the market. We are working to mitigate these pressures, but our fourth quarter is off to a slower than expected start.""

Retaliatory tariffs from our trading partners will be soon be imposed on an estimated $1.8 billion worth of Washington exports, including more than $1 billion in agricultural products, according to the Washington State Department of Commerce.

As one of the most trade-focused states in the nation, there’s a lot at stake for Washington workers if the administration fails to work constructively through the multilateral trade system.

Washington’s top exports are aerospace products including civilian aircraft, engines and parts. Agriculture is another significant export with more than $8 billion of homegrown apples, cherries, hops, pears, wheat and potatoes shipped to foreign markets last year.

Washington’s ports are the closest mainland U.S. ports to Asia and the proximity means about two-thirds of all Washington agricultural exports are destined for Asia.

They skirt the subject at church fundraisers and sidestep it at Jerry’s Café and Quick Stop, where farmers and aluminum workers gossip about everything else.

Here, the winners and losers in U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war live side-by-side.

The Republican president’s tariffs on imported metals were instrumental in reviving an aluminum plant that most locals had written off for dead. But in the fields surrounding the plant and across the county, farmers anxious over trade retaliations against U.S. crop exports are delaying equipment purchases, renting their land to hunters and pre-selling crops before harvest — locking in today’s prices for fear they will fall.

“People don’t want to talk about trade,” said Justin Rone, a farmer with deep family roots in soybeans and cotton. “It’s safer to talk about how best to grow your crop, keep your head down and pray.”

Farmers’ fears were realized Friday as the United States and China levied dueling tariffs on $34 billion worth of each country’s goods. Many U.S. agricultural exports, including soybeans, now face 25 percent duties.

Neil Priggel knows both sides of the trade war’s impact on his community. He worked at the Noranda Aluminum smelter before it went belly-up in 2016 and also runs his family’s 4,000-acre farm along with two brothers.

As Trump announced steel and aluminum tariffs in March, Priggel stared at the TV news and thought: We’re saved. We’ll get our jobs back.

His very next thought: We’ve got to protect the farm.

Priggel and other farmers here, where about 70 percent of voters supported Trump, know their crops are obvious targets for countries striking back against U.S. tariffs. They also know the tax on metal imports helped lure new owners to reopen the plant that has long financed their neighbors’ mortgages, truck payments and groceries.

Kathee Brown worked at Noranda for three decades. She returned in March a one-person human resources division for what’s now called Magnitude 7 Metals. Her phone rings constantly.

Is it true the plant is coming back?

Did you get my application?

At her dusty office desk, its drawers still full of old invoices, she checks her voicemail – full, again. Many callers are former plant workers; sometimes they break into tears when she calls back.

But some Chinese businesses, especially those in the farm sector, are still unhappy about Beijing's strategy, some watchers say.

""China is making clear that they have the tools, or arsenal if you will, to protect their economy from this escalating trade war,"" said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist of IHS Markit. ""But also I'm guessing there is some anxiety on the part of many Chinese businesses about this and where it ends up, so what they're essentially saying is, 'We'll protect you.'""

Revenue from higher duties China started collecting July 6 on U.S. products is expected to go to help ""alleviate the impact"" on companies and their employees, China's commerce ministry disclosed Monday. At the same time, the Chinese are encouraging importers to look for non-U.S. food and agricultural products for everything from soybeans and seafood to goods such as automobiles.

""The Chinese government has the ability to compensate and plenty of funds to tap,"" said Joshua Meltzer, senior fellow in the global economy and development program at the Brookings Institution, the D.C.-based think tank.

The trade spat escalated sharply Tuesday after the Trump administration unveiled a list of new 10 percent duties on $200 billion of Chinese imports. China on Wednesday slapped back with its own threat of tariffs on $200 billion of U.S. goods.

""U.S. extortion tricks, which are becoming more apparent, are diminishing in strength despite increasing in number,"" China's nationalist Global Times tabloid said Wednesday in an op-ed. ""The Chinese government has been ready to take retaliatory measures whenever needed.""

The Chinese state-run paper added, ""Some export-oriented companies in China have suffered directly from the trade war and deserve the government's help to minimize the losses. The Chinese government can adjust economics and trade toward less dependence on the U.S.""

China buys about two-thirds of the world's soybean exports, using most of it for soy protein to feed roughly 700 million pigs in the country or to make cooking oil. The soy also is used for feeding poultry and to support the country's fish farming sector.

""China has told their soybean importers, processors, animal feeders to just be prepared to consume 15 to 20 percent less soybeans next year than you did this year,"" said John Baize, president of John C. Baize and Associates, a consultant for the U.S. Soybean Export Council. ""Wait until the pigs get hungry. There's just not many things you can substitute for soybean meal. At some point you have to have the protein supplement.""

China buys roughly half of the U.S. soybean exports, and roughly one in three rows of soybeans grown on the nation's farms goes to the world's second-largest economy, according to the American Soybean Association. Nearly $20 billion in U.S. agricultural exports went to China last year, with more than half of that amount coming from soybeans.

Baize said he heard about a Chinese businessman in the soybean industry who was expressing frustration with Beijing's decision to target U.S. soybeans, particularly given how critical the commodity is as a feed source for the farm sector. ""They are mad as hell with their own government,"" he said. ""They said, 'What the hell are they doing?'""

Still, it’s unlikely Chinese executives are pushing too hard in public.

Trade watchers say Chinese buyers are paying a $35-a-ton premium for Brazilian soybeans to get around the recent duty imposed on U.S. beans, while also planning to buy more product from other global suppliers, including Russia, Ukraine, Paraguay, Uruguay and Canada. China has already tripled the amount of soybean purchases from Russia so far this year.

In recent weeks, the Chinese also have resold about 123,000 tons of U.S. soy to new buyers and in the months leading up to the new tariffs canceled more than $100 million in soybean purchases.

""I know why China chose soybeans, because it hits President Trump's base,"" said Baize. ""But I have a feeling that this was done by politicians who don't necessarily understand animal feed. Now they may be recognizing that they made their point but also may hurt themselves a lot more than they hurt us by picking soybeans.""

Besides soybeans, American pork produced in the heartland states also has been affected by Chinese tariffs. One in four hogs raised in the U.S. is sold overseas, and the Chinese are big buyers of the animal. China started collecting an additional 25 percent tariff last Friday on imported U.S. pork, which when added to the previous import taxes means a tax exceeding 70 percent.

President Donald Trump has previously offered to make it up to farmers, and USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue has spoken several times about Trump instructing him to craft a plan to help protect farmers and agricultural businesses. But the administration has provided few details on its ""playbook.""

“It would be unwise to unveil the playbook while other nations are watching, but if conditions warrant, USDA will quickly begin fulfilling that promise to support producers who become casualties of these disputes,"" a USDA spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday.

Agriculture executives say they have proposed plans to the administration that include helping some industries that are not currently part of subsidy programs, such as providing more federal spending for marketing support activities to develop new customers overseas. Other ideas have included increasing federal research spending to fight disease-carrying bugs, such as those that devastate citrus plants.

IHS' Behravesh said it's not surprising that the Trump administration would try to be reassuring to the farm sector since it's part of the president's base that got him elected in 2016. But in the end, he said, it's doubtful the White House will offer much in the way of a ""lifeline"" to agriculture or other industries, including the auto sector.

""From a political perspective, there maybe some symbolic stuff that's done to say, 'Look what we did for the U.S. farmers,'"" said Behravesh. ""But I don't think it will be enough to offset some of the hurt — whether it's soybean farmers or lobstermen in Maine.""

The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
149,North Dakota soybean processors hit hard by tariffs as China cancels orders,"As the trade war between the U.S. and China heats up,  North Dakota soybean processors are watching their selling season go to ruin.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/11/north-dakota-soybean-processors-hit-by-tariffs-as-china-cancels-orders.html,2018-07-11 19:27:00,"As the trade war between the U.S. and China heats up, North Dakota soybean processors are watching their selling season go to ruin.

The head of the North Dakota Trade Office says Chinese buyers have killed all of their firm orders for food-grade soybeans, valued at $1.2 to $1.5 million. The cancellations happened just prior to and immediately after tariffs went into effect in July.

North Dakota processors usually sell $30 million to $35 million in food-grade beans to China annually - with most of those contracts finalized in the summer months. They get those beans from farmers who they contract with before seeds are planted.

“Our food grade processors are normally working between July and August to lock in contracts with foreign customers,” says Simon Wilson, Executive Director of the North Dakota Trade office. “With China now on the sidelines they are working other Asian countries to see where they can sell the product.""

He adds that even if they find new buyers, sales would be less profitable, ""as moving to new customers drives lower margins than established ones.”

That round amounted to $34 billion in tariffs in a tit-for-tat trade war between the two nations. China targeted a range of commodities that went heavy on agricultural and seafood products, along with U.S.-made cars.

But where did the tariffs hit hardest around the country? Just as certain states took bigger hits, so did some counties. Generally, those counties likely to see the biggest percentage of their workforce impacted by the tariffs are those with small populations and a high level of dependency on a single industry, from chicken parts to construction machinery manufacturing.

China sells more to the U.S. than the U.S. sells to China. That narrows China's options in finding U.S.-made products on which to levy tariffs. As such, U.S. agricultural products became a big target.

151,China does not need US soybeans for state reserves: China official,"China, the world's top soybean buyer, can fully meet the needs of its state soybean reserves without importing from the United States, an official with the state stockpiler told state TV on Thursday.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/12/china-does-not-need-us-soybeans-for-state-reserves-china-official.html,2018-07-12 10:22:00,"China, the world's top soybean buyer, can fully meet the needs of its state soybean reserves without importing from the United States, an official with the state stockpiler told state TV on Thursday.

The comments by Lu Xiaodong, deputy general manager of Sinograin, on CCTV come after Beijing imposed 25 percent duties on imports of U.S. soybeans last Friday, in retaliation over measures imposed on Chinese goods by U.S. President Donald Trump.

The steep duties on beans from China's No. 2 supplier threaten to raise costs for livestock farmers and potentially increase the price of pork, the nation's favourite meat.

Without U.S. soybeans, China can import from South America and countries participating in China's Belt and Road initiative to satisfy its needs for state stocks, said Lu.

There are currently ample state stocks of soybeans, he said. The size of Beijing's soybean stockpiles is not known.

The report follows comments made by state-owned grains trader COFCO earlier this week, which also sought to soothe concerns about supplies of the oilseed in China.

152,"Current US soybean prices don't support farmers paying bills, says top industry official","A top U.S. soybean industry official said Thursday the administration's trade policies have ""hurt"" U.S. soybean prices, and he called the situation ""very frustrating,"" even for supporters of President Trump.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/12/fall-in-soybean-prices-from-china-trade-spat-leaves-farmers-struggling.html,2018-07-12 23:00:00,"American Soybean Association CEO Ryan Findlay said Thursday that China's retaliatory tariffs of 25 percent on U.S. beans have dealt farmers a major blow because it's led to low prices that essentially don't support paying bills.

""Farmers see that pain right now,"" Findlay said in an interview on CNBC's ""Power Lunch."" ""You have to have the prices to pay the bills — and the prices aren't there right now.""

U.S. soybean futures have fallen nearly 20 percent since China announced on April 4 plans to slap a 25 percent tariff on 106 U.S. products, including soybeans. At the same time, Brazilian soybeans are fetching a significant premium over the Chicago prices due to increased demand from Chinese buyers.

""If somebody were to lose 20 percent of their income, that hurts,"" Findlay said. ""I don't care what segment of industry you're in, that hurts — and farmers are feeling that right now. And they're starting to feel that emotional impact.""

Findlay said another ripple effect is farmers holding off buying farm equipment because ""they won't have the funds to make that purchase.""

According to the soybean industry official, the administration's trade policies have ""hurt"" U.S. soybean prices. He called the situation ""very frustrating,"" even for supporters of President Donald Trump.

Findlay said, however, that he thinks U.S. farmers are generally supportive of Trump's position on issues such as theft of intellectual property by China.

Trump sought to reassure farmers on Wednesday in two tweets: ""I am in Brussels, but always thinking about our farmers."" A second tweet had the president pledging he's ""fighting for a level playing field for our farmers, and will win!""

Findlay was asked if Trump was being sincere. ""We're going to find out,"" he responded. ""Hopefully we see some effort to help some of these long-range efforts on our part to develop new markets.""

The soybean official also believes economics will play a role when farmers go to vote in November's midterm elections.

""I think farmers are going to pay attention to their farms first,"" he said, ""and when they go in to the ballot box there's a host of issues that they pay attention to. But economics are No. 1 for them.""

Top soybean-producing states include Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Indiana, Missouri, and Ohio — many that Trump won in the 2016 presidential election. The U.S. pork industry — pork is another big commodity produced in the nation's heartland — has been hit by hefty tariffs, and there are other key farm products, including corn, wheat and cotton.

""If the president isn't going to move off center with the tariffs, then we need to look at other long-term solutions that we can focus on,"" said Findlay. ""And that's what we're pushing with the administration and with members of Congress.""

Nearly $20 billion in U.S. agricultural exports went to China last year, with more than half of that amount coming from soybeans. Mexico also is another major buyer of U.S. agricultural products and has slapped tariffs on several farm or food products, including American pork and cheeses.

While China is clearly ""a huge market for us,"" Findlay said there was a need for the U.S. industry ""to diversify that marketplace."" He also called on the U.S. administration to make other trade agreements and to improve export development programs that the federal government conducts to help American farmers.

At the same time, Findlay said the U.S. is vulnerable to longer-term impacts as competitors such as Brazil look to expand planted soy acreage and capture a bigger share of the global marketplace.

""Brazil is a major competitor,"" said Findlay. He said the South American country still has ""millions of acres yet to go into production.""

Together, the U.S. and Brazil represent about 80 percent of the global exports of soybeans.

The U.S. sold approximately 33 million tons of soybeans in 2017 to China, or just over one-third of the beans imported by the Asian country. By comparison, Brazil shipped more than 50 million tons of soybeans last year to China and represented nearly 55 percent of the total imports.

153,Novozymes and Novo Nordisk sign deal to source power from Denmark’s largest wind farm,The wind farm will be located in the Baltic Sea off the coast of Denmark.,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/13/novozymes-and-novo-nordisk-sign-deal-to-source-power-from-denmarks-la.html,2018-07-13 11:42:00,"Novozymes and Novo Nordisk have signed an agreement to source power from Vattenfall’s Kriegers Flak offshore wind park, the Swedish utility said Friday.

The facility, located in the Baltic Sea, is set to be in full operation by the end of 2021. With a little over 600 megawatts of capacity, Vattenfall said that the Kriegers Flak site is set to be Denmark’s largest wind farm.



Global health care business Novo Nordisk employs around 42,100 people across 79 countries, while biotechnology firm Novozymes has more than 6,000 employees.



While the deal between Vattenfall, Novozymes and Novo Nordisk will begin on January 1, 2020, Kriegers Flak is not set to be fully operational until the end of 2021. Until then, Novo Nordisk and Novozymes will source power from Vattenfall’s other Danish wind farms.



“The agreement with Vattenfall moves Novo Nordisk one step closer to reaching our ambition: That all Novo Nordisk production facilities worldwide will run on renewable power by 2020,” Dorethe Nielsen, Novo Nordisk’s head of corporate environmental strategy, said in a statement. “With the Vattenfall agreement all of Novo Nordisk European production will run on renewable power,” Nielsen added.

Lene Aabo, Novozymes’ vice president for sourcing and facility management, said the new agreement would give the business “a stable supply of renewable power at competitive terms.”



The scale of Kriegers Flak is considerable. Its 72 turbines will have a rotor diameter of 167 meters and weigh almost 900 tons each. Europe is now home to more than 4,000 offshore wind turbines across 11 countries, according to trade body WindEurope.

Companies like General Motors and other automakers, are making it clear that costs are rising as a result of tariffs. Meanwhile, business lobbies have sought to stop further tariffs, particularly on automobiles, which could have a wider, more significant impact on the economy and jobs.

Trump is clearly concerned about the economic pain from tariffs, and analysts say it is clear he needs a win on the trade front. As a result, they expect the U.S. may show more flexibility on NAFTA and with Europe.

The president, while standing with Juncker, also made a point of discussing how Europe has agreed to buy U.S. liquefied natural gas and soybeans, a crop that could be hit hard by tariffs already imposed by China. Trump also agreed to hold off on all tariffs on European goods for now: Those include autos, which was seen as one the most economically damaging proposals he has made for industry and consumers.

""I'm sure they're also feeling a lot of pressure from the news that we had recently about the beef producers and the ag producers,"" said Juan Carlos Hartasanchez, senior director at Albright Stonebridge, referring to reports of U.S. beef piling up in cold storage.

""When you have to put together a bailout package for your producers because of the impact of your trade negations had, I think that's the moment when the administration steps back and thinks ... 'These things are having an effect on U.S. jobs and on the U.S. economy,'"" he said. ""

For them it's also a way to say we're making progress. We're not only losing, we're also winning,"" Hartasanchez added.

But if the U.S. economy starts to suffer from the trade dispute with China, Strategas ' Clifton said that would motivate Trump to restart talks. In the case of China, it too might come to the table sooner, if it suddenly appears as though Republicans would make a strong showing in the November mid-terms, retaining both houses of Congress, he said.

The U.S. has so far slapped tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese products, and aluminum and steel. China has taken similar actions on U.S. goods. Tariffs on the first $34 billion of the $50 billion went into effect earlier this month by both countries, with the rest yet to be implemented.

However, there are bigger threats in the balance, with Trump proposing $200 billion more in an effort to get China to ease its position on U.S. intellectual property and tariffs.Clifton said that revamping the World Trade Organization (WTO) would be an important step that could resolve some U.S. concerns.

""The WTO reform is the essence of what Trump is trying to fix with China,"" said Clifton. China is the world's second-largest economy, but is considered a developing nation, a status that gives them more leeway to impose trade restrictions, the analyst explained.

""They're allowed to have tariffs on average of 9 percent,"" Clifton added, while a developed country would only be able to have tariffs in low single digits.

Separately, Trump has ""gotten buy in from Europe that maybe the World Trade Organization needs to be reformed. ... If we're reforming the WTO, we're doing it to make China play by a better system of rules,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Canada on Friday said it plans to host a meeting of trade ministers to discuss how to reform the WTO, but it left the U.S. and China out of the meetings for now.

155,"Full-scale bailout for industries impacted by tariffs would cost $39 billion, Chamber of Commerce says","Spreading a buyout across all industries affected by the ongoing trade war would cost taxpayers $39 billion, according to a U.S. Chamber of Commerce analysis.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/30/full-scale-bailout-for-industries-impacted-by-tariffs-would-cost-39-b.html,2018-07-30 13:46:00,"Spreading a bailout across all industries affected by the ongoing trade war would cost taxpayers $39 billion, according to a U.S. Chamber of Commerce analysis.

The Chamber opposes the billions in tariffs that President Donald Trump has slapped on a host of goods from China as well as steel and aluminum imports.

To compensate for the economic damage, Trump recently approved $12 billion in emergency aid for farmers who produce certain goods, particularly soybeans. The package was touted as a temporary solution while negotiations continue, but the president has taken seething criticism including from his own party and some farmers themselves.

In its study of what would happen should the aid program spread, the Chamber said the effects would be substantial.

""The best way to protect American industries from the damaging consequences of a trade war is to avoid entering into a trade war in the first place,"" Neil Bradley, the organization's executive vice president and chief policy officer, said in a statement. ""The administration's focus should be expanding free trade and removing these harmful tariffs, not allocating taxpayer's money to only marginally ease the suffering for some of the industries feeling the pain of the trade war.""

The aid package, Bradley said, is ""a slippery — and costly — slope.""

The Chamber compared the total amount of the farmers' aid to the amount of exports affected by the tariffs, then applied the same ratio across other impacted industries, to come up with the bailout requirement if it was applied across the board.

Doing so produced the $39 billion total — $12 billion to the farmers, plus another $27 billion to other industries. The impact ranged from $43 million for starch and glue producers up to $7.6 billion for auto, motorcycle and parts manufacturers.

There have been no indications from the White House that it is considering extending the aid package to other industries.

As a matter of proportion, if the administration did decide to compensate all industries and the Chamber's figures are accurate, the total would amount to about 0.2 percent of GDP and just shy of 1 percent of the fiscal 2018 budget total.

The international food company now expects adjusted earnings for fiscal year 2018 at approximately $5.70 to $6.00, down from a range of $6.55 to $6.70.

""The combination of changing global trade policies here and abroad, and the uncertainty of any resolution, have created a challenging market environment of increased volatility, lower prices and oversupply of protein,"" said Tom Hayes, Tyson Foods president and chief executive officer. ""We will continue to watch these conditions carefully.""

The company, which raises and processes chicken, pork, beef and prepared foods, detailed its reasons for providing investors with an update for the fiscal year in a press release dated July 30. According to the document, the primary drivers for the reduced guidance are:

""Uncertainty in trade policies and increased tariffs negatively impacting domestic and export prices - primarily chicken and pork""

""Increased volatility in the commodity markets resulting in a greater than expected increase in the domestic supply of proteins and lower sales prices""

""Sluggish domestic chicken demand due to such pricing of competing proteins""

""Pork margin compression driven by an imbalance in supply and demand""

""A benefit from tax reform of about $0.77 per share vs. a previous projection of $0.85 cents per share.""

The United States has been embroiled in a growing tit-for-tat trade war in recent months as President Donald Trump's administration seeks to force economic partners like China, Mexico and the European Union into more favorable trade deals.

Following the White House's decision to slap duties on imported steel and aluminum, however, Mexico imposed a 10 percent tariff on chilled and frozen pork muscle cuts, which took effect June 5 and doubled to 20 percent earlier this month. Such tariffs have had a direct impact on the American agricultural sector as foreign governments take aim Republican-heavy electoral regions in an effort to pressure lawmakers into opposing Trump's actions.

China, meanwhile, started collecting an additional 25 percent import duty on $34 billion worth of U.S. goods in response to President Trump's actions against Beijing for intellectual property theft. The country's retaliatory measures include tariffs on soybeans, corn, wheat, cotton, whiskey and dairy. Nearly $20 billion in U.S. agricultural exports went to China last year, with the more than half of that amount coming from soybeans.

One in 4 hogs raised in the U.S. is sold overseas, and the Chinese are the world's top consumers of pork.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
157,Diamondback to buy Energen in $9.2 billion deal to boost its Permian presence,"Diamondback Energy agreed to buy  shale rival Energen in an  all-stock deal valued at $9.2 billion, giving it  an expanded footprint in the country's largest and fastest growing oil  field.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/15/diamondback-to-buy-energen-in-9point2-billion-deal-to-boost-its-permian-p.html,2018-08-15 10:13:00,"U.S. oil and gas producer Diamondback Energy on Tuesday agreed to buy shale rival Energen in an all-stock deal valued at $9.2 billion, giving it an expanded footprint in the country's largest and fastest growing oil field.

Energen had been under pressure from activist investor Corvex Management for more than a year to sell itself to address weak returns. The proposed acquisition is Diamondback's second in the Permian in a week, after striking a deal to pay $1.2 billion for Ajax Resources.

West Texas shale producers also are facing pressure to expand scale and efficiency in the Permian basin as higher costs for services, and the need to secure limited pipeline transport out of the region, weigh on smaller and midsize companies.

The deal values Energen's properties at about $65,000 per acre (0.4 hectare), among the highest prices in the Permian in the last several years, said Andrew Dittmar, an M&A analyst at data provider DrillingInfo.

Concho Resources Inc earlier this year paid $8 billion in stock, or more than $70,000 per acre, for West Texas shale rival RSP Permian.

The purchase brings together two companies with holdings in the same areas of the Permian, said Dittmar, potentially allowing for longer horizontal wells, shared labor and equipment.

For independent oil producers like Diamondback, adding new drilling prospects represents the best way to compete for services with larger rivals that have moved into the Permian this year despite pressure by investors to focus on shareholder returns.

Shale producers including Apache Corp, ConocoPhillips, Parsley Energy and Pioneer Natural Resources recently have increased their 2018 capital budgets as oil prices have held above $65 a barrel.

Exxon Mobil Corp, BP PLC and other large oil companies that missed out on in the early years of the shale boom are also boosting shale investments, using historical alliances to secure a larger role with oilfield service and pipeline companies in the Permian.

Last month, BP agreed to pay $10.5 billion, its largest purchase in nearly two decades, to acquire assets in three shale basins from Australian mining company BHP Billiton. That deal also was spurred by hedge fund Elliott Management.

Corvex and activist Carl Icahn, who last week disclosed he had acquired more stock in Energen, were not available for immediate comment.

Diamondback's implied offer of $84.95 per Energen share represents a premium of about 16 percent to Energen's Tuesday close. The transaction includes $830 million in net debt.

Energen shares rose 9.3 percent to $79.90 in after-market trading, while Diamondback shares fell 5.5 percent to $126.40.

Citigroup Global Markets Inc is the financial adviser to Diamondback, while J.P. Morgan Securities and Tudor, Pickering, Holt are financial advisers to Energen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
158,Trump support dips among farmers as trade war wallops agriculture,"President Donald Trump received about 70 percent of the vote among farmers in 2016, but new polling from Farm Journal Research shows that his support is shrinking.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/15/trump-support-falls-sharply-among-farmers-says-farm-journal-poll.html,2018-08-15 4:33:00,"Support for President Donald Trump among farmers has dipped as the trade war with China drags on, according to a Farm Journal Research survey published Tuesday.

Trump received about 70 percent of farmers' votes in the 2016 election but a new poll shows only more than 50 percent would vote for him again. The poll found that over 40 percent of them view Trump unfavorably and 35 percent ""less favorably"" since the trade war erupted.

The trade spat with China has resulted in retaliatory tariffs on a wide range of U.S. farm products.

Even so, Morning Consult polling data last week showed another trend: Trump support has remained intact or improved among rural voters. It found support was up in Iowa among rural voters despite the state being a large producer of some key commodities hit by new duties, including pork and soybeans.

Farm Journal's poll of about 2,300 farmers, conducted the week of Aug. 6, found 52 percent of farmers view Trump as favorable and 43 percent consider him as unfavorable. The remaining 5 percent had no opinion.

Chicago soybean futures were down about 15 percent since early April when China announced it would slap a 25 percent tariff on the 106 U.S. products, including American soy. Farm income this year could fall to the lowest level since 2006, according to government estimates.

The Trump administration last month announced a $12 billion emergency aid plan to help farmers impacted by retaliatory tariffs. But some farmers have said the assistance won't make them ""whole.""

While some farmers support Trump making China accountable on trade issues, they also worry about unintended consequences. Some are concerned about uncertainties surrounding the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.

When farmers were asked whether they would vote to re-elect Trump, only 54 percent said ""yes"" and another 46 percent said ""no,"" according to the Farm Journal poll.

The poll found Trump's support stronger among younger farmers under 45 years old, with two-thirds in favor of the president getting a second term. Yet 57 percent of the farmers aged 65 or older said they wouldn't re-elect Trump.

The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.

The government implemented a new residential lease structure earlier this year.  The document contains language to ensure ?landlords and renters understand their rights and responsibilities,? the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing website states. The new structure could also prevent misunderstandings between the two parties.  Whether farmers are renting out secondary units, like basement apartments, or entire houses, they may need to adopt this new template, which applies to leases beginning on or after April 30 this year.  If renters have signed non-standard agreements since that date, they can submit a written request to their landlord for new leases, the website states. Landlords must meet this requirement within 21 days or their tenants could temporarily withhold rent for one month.  Parties who signed agreements before April 30 can only switch to the new standard template if they ?negotiate a new lease agreement with new terms on or after this date,? the website states.  Some individuals may be exempt from this new standard lease. The Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (RTA) may not apply to parties in situations where, for example:  The tenant?s accommodation ?is conditional upon ? continuing to be employed on a farm,? section 5 (b) of the RTA states. This exemption applies whether the individual lives on that farm or on another property.  The renter lives with the owners or the owners? immediate family members, and must share bathroom or kitchen facilities with them, section 5 (i) states.  A tenant occupies a building for both living accommodation and business or agricultural purposes, section 5 (j) states. The lease must include both uses.  Farmers can benefit from the new lease structure, as they can work from a template rather than writing the entire document.  The new form ?is very comprehensive and intuitive,? Nathan Kolomaya, a lawyer with Brimage Law Group in Simcoe, Ont., told Farms.com today. ?The step-by-step (process) is well laid out.?  You can download the standard lease template on the Ontario government website.  To learn more about these agreements, parties can contact their lawyers or the Landlord and Tenant Board at 1-888-332-3234.

Yesterday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ordered the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to ban sales of chlorpyrifos. Producers use this pesticide to protect corn, soybeans, wheat, and several fruit and vegetable crops from aphids, beetles and cutworms.  The federal agency failed to ban the crop protection product earlier, despite understanding its potential risks to children, the ruling says .  The court order reverses a March 2017 decision by former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt to reject a petition calling for the pesticide?s ban.  DowDuPont, who introduced the pesticide in 1965, remains a leading manufacturer of chlorpyrifos. The company markets the pesticide under the Lorsban label.  Growers applied the pesticide to about 11 percent of soybean acres and eight million corn acres in 2008, the company?s website says.  DowDuPont expects to challenge the court ruling.  ?All appellate options to challenge the majority?s decision will be considered,? Gregg Schmidt, a spokesman for DowDuPont, said in a statement yesterday, The Washington Post reports. ?We will continue to support the growers who need this important product.?  The EPA must comply with the order within 60 days.  Agency officials will use as much time as they need to make sure an outright ban on the product is a necessary action.  ?EPA is reviewing the decision,? Michael Abboud, a spokesman for the EPA, said in a statement.  Data from Columbia University, which was used to support the ban, ?remains inaccessible and has hindered the agency?s ongoing process to fully evaluate the pesticide using the best available, transparent science,? Abboud added.

Canadian customers contacted Hutchinson to purchase the syrup after a CBC story about her situation.  ?It wasn?t even anything we did,? Hutchinson said. ?People just started calling and emailing us saying they would buy some of the syrup.?  Last week, Hutchinson?s company, Hutchinson Acres, bottled and labeled about 900 litres of maple syrup destined for Saudi Arabia. Then, she received a call from her buyer to put the order on hold.  ?It?s quite the shock when you have everything on pallets and are waiting for the trucks to arrive only to have to cancel everything,? Hutchinson said.  Saudi Arabia suspended shipments of maple syrup in response to an ongoing diplomatic dispute with Canada. The Middle Eastern country has also paused imports of Canadian wheat and barley .  Aside from the words ?Hutchinson?s,? ?Your Maple Syrup,? and ?Keep it sweet, but naturally,? all the text on the jug is in Arabic.  ?We have (international) customers in Germany and Dubai,? Hutchinson said ?But we had to get approvals from local governing bodies for those specific labels. We didn?t get permission from Dubai to use the same labels for Saudi Arabia, so we had to make new one specifically for that market.  ?Whenever you go into a new market, the customers want to make sure the label meets all of their requirements.?

The CODEX Alimentarius Commission established the MRL, a BASF release said today. As a result, quinclorac has been omitted from 2018-2019 grain company declaration forms.  This development is a critical step towards helping canola producers control cleavers ? tough and resilient weeds.  Many stakeholders in the industry worked together in this process.  ?BASF submitted a comprehensive data package to support the establishment of CODEX MRLs for quinclorac,?

166,Nine escape rooms related to ag,,https://www.farms.com/ag-industry-news/nine-escape-rooms-related-to-ag-765.aspx,2018-08-13 14:07:50,"Can you escape before time runs out?  By Diego Flammini  Staff Writer  Farms.com  A current trend for teambuilding or group activities is trying to solve escape rooms.  Groups are locked in a themed room and must solve a series of puzzles to escape before a given time limit expires.  Themes for these rooms vary from preventing bank heists and escaping a stuck elevator to evading a prison execution.  As it turns out, agriculture is also represented in some escape room games.  So, here are nine escape room games related to ag.  1) Sheriff?s Jail  This game at Downs On The Farm in Amherst, Ohio. is located inside a barn from the 1800s.  Your group has been imprisoned for stealing cows and bootlegging moonshine. The sheriff has stepped out to a local tavern, giving you the perfect opportunity to escape the prison.  2) The Great Cellar Escape  This escape room at Boreal Winery in Warren, Ont. takes place inside a real wine cellar.  For this game, you are the winemaker(s) in the cellar collecting late-night data when the door suddenly closes behind you. You?re now stuck in an above-ground concrete cave with no mobile reception.  3) AgXscape  This ag-related room is located at the Hilmar Cheese Company?s visitor center in Hilmar, Calif. and is dairy themed.  In this room, your group is managing Bob?s dairy farm when you receive a call from a neighbor that the herd has contracted a virus and require vaccines. You?ve got 30 minutes to solve dairy-related puzzles to unlock the vaccines.  4) Escape Maze  In Peterborough, Ont., escape room lovers will find Escape Maze . While the four rooms themselves aren?t ag themed, they are located inside the barn on a family farm.  The games include trying to enter a poker game and solving the mystery of what was really inside a coffin.  5) Escape Maize  If you?re in Staffordshire, England, you can try your luck at National Forest Adventure Farm?s escape maize maze.  The farmers have combined the traditional idea of a corn maze with the fun of an escape room to create an experience with a James Bond theme.  Agent Academy challenges groups to navigate 10 acres of corn, paths, bridges and towers to solve 10 physical and mental obstacles.  6) Capone?s Case  While visiting Lake Williamson in Carlinville, Ill., you can solve an escape room in a dairy barn.  In (Al) Capone?s Case, you are part of a team of Treasury Agents searching the barn at Lake Williamson for a ledger that documents Capone?s tax evasion. You have one hour before Capone and his body guards return.  7) Suspicious Farmhouse  Should you find yourself in Eindhoven, Netherlands , an escape room challenges you to find a missing farmer named John.  The farmhouse contains traced of blood and evidence of violence. Your team has 60 minutes to unlock secrets of the farm to solve John?s disappearance.  8) Jailhouse Justice  An escape room at Escape Hunt Dallas challenges you to escape a cruel punishment.  Your ranch has been accused of cattle rustling and you are set to be hanged. You?ve got 60 minutes to escape the prison and clear your name.  9) Crazy Farmer  In Wageningen, Netherlands, you are tasked with preventing a harmful resource from being spread.  The story of the Crazy Farmer escape room is that a professor who lived on a farm developed a resource that could end world hunger. But that resource proved to be dangerous to humans.  The professor was exiled from the community for his invention but now wants to take revenge on all who he felt wronged him. You have 60 minutes to find the professor?s invention before he returns to the farm.

167,Preserving ALR land in British Columbia,,https://www.farms.com/ag-industry-news/preserving-alr-land-in-british-columbia-767.aspx,2018-08-13 17:24:51,"An independent committee submitted a list of 27 items to consider  By Diego Flammini  Staff Writer  Farms.com  A group of British Columbians submitted a list of items to lawmakers to help them protect prime farmland in the province.  Lana Popham, B.C.?s agriculture minister, selected eight industry representatives in January to form the Minister?s Advisory Committee for Revitalizing the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR). The process also included an online survey and written submissions from different communities.  The interim report includes 13 legislative changes and 14 key issues that need to be addressed to better protect the 4.6 million acres of provincially protected land inside the ALR?s borders.  The committee provided its report to the Agricultural Land Commission (ALC), an independent tribunal charged with administering the Agricultural Land Commission Act. The ALC submitted the report to the provincial Ministry of Agriculture.  One of the committee?s recommendations is to see the ALR as farmland first.  ""Within the ALR itself, agriculture has to be the priority of the province and the province must step up to the plate,"" Vicki Huntington, committee chair told CBC s Radio West on Thursday.  The committee also wants the provincial government to come up with guidelines for homes built within the ALR.  Large residential developments has driven the cost of ALR land up, making it difficult for producers who wish to farm the land long term.  ?Purchase of ALR land by non-farmers, coupled with no provincial limits on the scale and size of residential development, is pushing the cost of land out of the reach of farmers,? the report states.  In terms of agricultural production on the ALR, the committee suggests limiting one crop.  Greenhouse cannabis production should be restricted to protect the land underneath the structures, the panel said.  ?The anticipated large scale of these structures will damage the land base and permanently alienate large tracts of land from agricultural use,? the committee?s report says.  The committee also called for a full analysis of the ALR to determine how much land is suitable for farming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since these pests can transfer West Nile Virus to humans, producers can take a few precautions to protect themselves from becoming infected with the disease.  ?The main thing that they can do would be to wear long-sleeved clothing,? Dr. Nick Brandon, a physician with Public Health Ontario, told Farms.com yesterday.  In addition, when possible, people may want to ?remove any sources of standing water where they live or work, such as in tires,? as mosquitos lay eggs in these locations, Brandon said.  As these insects tend to rest in bushes and shrubs, farmers could also keep these areas ?clear of overgrowth and debris,? the Ontario government website states.  Producers can protect themselves by ?using insect repellants that contain DEET or icaridin,? Brandon said.  Individuals who contract West Nile virus may display such symptoms as fevers, headaches, body aches, fatigue and skin rashes, the Public Health Ontario website states. Sometimes, they may also experience nausea and vomiting.  However, only 20 per cent of infected people will display any symptoms. And less than 1 per cent of individuals who contract the disease will ?experience severe illness involving the central nervous system,? the agency says.  People who do not show any symptoms ?will fight off the infection and won?t have any complications,? Brandon said. ?Generally, these people won?t need any testing and will be healthy.?  Since horses are also at risk of becoming infected with the disease, the federal government works with the animal health community to monitor the virus in these large animals, its website says. Farmers can contact their veterinarians to learn about vaccines to prevent West Nile Virus in horses.  nechaev-kon/iStock/Getty Images Plus photo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
169,Reducing runoff with 4R BMPs,,https://www.farms.com/ag-industry-news/reducing-runoff-with-4r-bmps-515.aspx,2018-08-02 14:44:09,"Management practices could benefit both farmers and the environment  By Kaitlynn Anderson  Staff Writer  Farms.com  By incorporating best management practices (BMPs) into their operations, producers could lend a helping hand to the environment.  In recent research, Canadian scientists found that Ontario growers can significantly reduce nutrient runoff and greenhouse gas emissions by implementing 4R Nutrient Stewardship BMPs, today?s release from Fertilizer Canada said. These practices involve four principles: right source, right rate, right time and right place.  In fact, producers could reduce runoff on their farms by 60 per cent by applying phosphorus through subsurface banding rather than broadcasting the product, the release said.  In addition, if farmers combine UAN with nitrification and urease inhibitors, they could reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by up to 75 per cent when applying the fertilizer to corn at the eight-leaf growth stage, the researchers found.  Producers could reap economic benefits by following these practices, too, the release stated.  By combining the right place and right source principles to inject UAN fertilizer into the soil, farmers ?can improve corn yields by 20 per cent when compared to broadcasting,? the release said.  These results could benefit the province?s agricultural industry.  ?It?s important that farmers are able to increase their production to contribute to Ontario?s economy and to do so in a way that minimizes any impacts on the environment,? Clyde Graham, Fertilizer Canada?s spokesperson, told Farms.com today. ?This research contributes to that effort.?  Fertilizer Canada shared the research in its new report, Key Findings of the Canadian 4R Research Network, which highlights 10 practices that producers commonly use on their farms. To read about these actions ? including optimizing nitrogen at seeding and split-applying sulphur ? click here .  For more information on these BMPs, farmers can contact their agri-retailers, Graham said. Many of these businesses have certified crop advisers with training in 4R Nutrient Stewardship.

Six North Carolina residents claimed that Murphy Brown LLC, a local pork producer under Smithfield Foods Inc., failed to take ?adequate steps to manage the number of hogs on the farm, leading to odor and the possibility of disease,? a Reuters article stated on Friday.  The jury awarded $3 to 5 million in compensatory damages and $75 million in punitive damages to each individual on Friday, the article stated. In total, the company will pay $437.5 million to the plaintiffs.  On the day the court announced the verdict, pork producers met with federal and state officials and lawmakers for the National Agriculture Leaders Roundtable in Raleigh, N.C., Friday?s NPPC release said.  At this meeting, farmers discussed the lawsuits that people have brought forth against 26 pork operations in the state due to noises and odors.  The Murphy Brown case is the third case the court has heard within the last three months, the release said.  ?Enough is enough,? Howard Hill, an Iowa pork producer and past NPPC president, said in the release. ?It?s time for our elected leaders to step up and stop this madness.?  The lawsuits could severely harm the industry.  ?Some people ? who brought these nuisance suits seem determined to destroy the hog industry in the state,? Jim Heimerl, president of the NPPC, said in the release. ?If they succeed, they?ll put more than 46,000 people out of work and cost the state ? the nation?s second-largest pork producer ? millions of dollars in economic activity.?  And the effects could spread across the country.  ?If the trial lawyers in the N.C. lawsuits are successful, they?ll likely go to other hog-producing states,? Dave Warner, communications director for the NPPC, told Farms.com today. ?If this madness isn?t stopped, hog farmers, their employees and, ultimately, consumers will lose.

Megz Reynolds, who works about 2,100 acres of land, posted an invitation on Twitter inviting federal and provincial politicians to spend some time with her chatting about Canadian agriculture.  She posted her invitation on Thursday after seeing farmers in France and the United Kingdom doing the same thing.  She?s particularly inviting politicians who may not be familiar with the ag sector, but who manage portfolios that can impact the industry.  #Harvest18 is underway in Saskatchewan and I would like to extend an invitation to anyone involved in provincial or federal politics to come for a ride and talk #CdnAg and grain farming!!

Dirt Sweat N Tears (@farmermegzz) August 9, 2018  Reynolds grew up in the city and knew nothing about grain production until she ?started dating a farmer,? she admits.  And engaging with decisionmakers who have limited ag knowledge can be an effective way to bridge informational gaps.  ?I think it would be beneficial for them because a lot of times there are files that come across their desk that factor into Canadian agriculture and grain farming, like Bill C-49,? she told Farms.com on Friday. ?I think it?s a great opportunity for them to come out and ride with me in the combine and for them to ask me any questions they might have.?  Reynolds stressed the tone of any visits would be casual.  The invitations are not meant to be an opportunity to debate but just to have regular conversations about an important Canadian industry.  ?This is not meant to argue about different policies or debate what?s in the news right now,? she said. ?I just want people come out and learn about what we?re doing and why we?re doing it. Unless you?re immersed in agriculture, you might not understand how we?re going about producing our crops.?  Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe has accepted the offer, and she plans to invite some individuals more formally.  She?s also open to hosting other urban citizens on her farm who are concerned about the source of their food.

172,Saudi Arabia halts Canadian grain imports,,https://www.farms.com/ag-industry-news/saudi-arabia-halts-canadian-grain-imports-678.aspx,2018-08-09 12:25:15,"A diplomatic dispute has spurred the country to stop buying wheat and barley from Canada  By Kate Ayers  Staff Writer  Farms.com  Saudi Arabia?s wheat buying agency will no longer purchase Canadian wheat and barley in its international tenders.  On Tuesday, grain traders received an official notice from the Saudi Grains Organization, a Reuters article said. The agency will not accept milling wheat or feed barley cargoes from Canada, the notice said.  This decision could be a result of Canada?s refusal to back down on its defense of human rights. Following Global Affairs Canada?s request on Monday to free arrested Saudi civil activists, Saudi Arabia paused new trade and investment and expelled the Canadian ambassador, the article said.  The question remains as to whether Saudi Arabia?s call impacts only new purchases or delivery of previously agreed contracts as well.  ?But I would not deliver Canadian grains to Saudi Arabia right now, even on previous contracts,? a European trader said to Reuters.  However, G3, a Winnipeg-based grain trader, said the decision has not impacted operations and is continuing with ?business as usual,? Reuters reports.  G3 is a partnership of the Saudi Arabian Agriculture Company and U.S. grain handler Bunge Ltd., the article said. The Canadian Wheat Board is owned by G3.  Despite this halt in trade between Saudi Arabia and Canada, other markets could be available for Canadian grains.  In recent years, the Middle East has imported less wheat from Canada and the U.S., while China has become a larger barley buyer, the article said.  ?There will be plenty of opportunities for Canada to sell barley and wheat elsewhere,? Chuck Penner, an analyst with LeftField Commodity Research, said in the article.  That said, the loss of any trade market is consequential.  ?Every loss of a market is important,? Cam Dahl, Cereals Canada president, said to Farms.com today.  ?It does seem that our market access issues are growing over time. ? Saudi Arabia is on a growing list of countries where there are market access issues, which is a concern.?  The trade dispute may have a greater impact on barley trade compared to wheat.  ?We export about 1.9 million tonnes of barley a year and 135,000 tonnes in the last crop year went to Saudi Arabia,? Dahl said.  ?That is about 7 per cent of our barley exports, which is a significant amount.?  A whole government approach is needed to ensure continued access to our trade markets, Dahl added.  ?It is important, in this era of rising protectionism, that all of our government departments and agencies have a very focused trade lens on everything they do,? he said.  ?And that, for every policy that comes out, there?s an understanding of ? how it will impact Canada?s trading relationships.?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
173,U.S. soybeans arrive in China,,https://www.farms.com/ag-industry-news/u-s-soybeans-arrive-in-china-756.aspx,2018-08-13 12:06:36,"The shipment is the first since China imposed tariffs on American soybean imports  By Diego Flammini  Staff Writer  Farms.com  China is unloading the first vessel of American soybeans since it imposed 25 percent tariffs on soybean imports as part of a trade war with the U.S.  Peak Pegasus, a ship carrying 70,000 tons of U.S. soybeans worth about US$23 million, docked at the Port of Dalian on Saturday. The crew began unloading the same day.  The ship was the focus of media attention after it departed Seattle on June 8 but failed to arrive in China before the import tariffs took effect. The vessel had been sitting idle off China?s coast for the last five weeks.  U.S. producers are encouraged by China?s decision to accept the soybeans.  ?Most of us know that China imports almost half of all U.S. soybeans destined for export,? Anne Meis, a producer and director with the Nebraska Soybean Board, told Farms.com today. ?We are the only farmers who can meet their soybean needs.?  China will also pay the necessary levies.  Sinograin, a state-owned grain stockpiler, will cover the costs of the 25 percent import tariff. That equals about US$6 million, Reuters reports .  China?s willingness to pay the tariffs shows that trade between Washington and Beijing needs to continue, Meis said.  ?We?re going to see how this all plays out, but this is a relationship that needs to be repaired,? she said. ?They need the soybeans and we grow the soybeans. It?s as simple as that.?  Two other American ships carrying soybeans, Star Jennifer and Cemtex Pioneer, are currently idling off China?s coast.

174,Understanding ag leases for barns and sheds,,https://www.farms.com/ag-industry-news/understanding-ag-leases-for-barns-and-sheds-610.aspx,2018-08-07 14:52:56,"Farmers can rent these buildings to expand their operations or for storage purposes  By Kaitlynn Anderson  Staff Writer  Farms.com  While many Ontario producers are familiar with the practice of renting farmland, they may have questions about another type of lease that could benefit their operations.  Often, farmers rent production facilities, like barns or sheds, from other growers to expand their capacities, Matthew Innes, an associate at Miller Thomson LLP in Waterloo, Ont., told Farms.com today. They may also use these buildings for storage.  While customizing rental agreements for these facilities, renters and landlords may want to consider a few key factors.  One important element involves the length of the leases.  Parties should specify start and end dates within the agreements, Innes said, particularly when the owner needs the facility for another use by a certain date. To ensure renters vacate the premises on time, landlords may want ?to include penalties ? that can be applied if the other side does not meet those commitments.?  In addition, parties may want to agree on who will pay for certain bills, since ?the use of the facilities by the renter may increase property taxes, utility costs and insurance costs,? Innes said.  In the agreement, both sides should also decide which party will carry out maintenance activities and replace equipment, he said.  ?Production facilities and the equipment within them can often depreciate at relatively high rates,? he said. ?The lease agreement should be tailored to carefully lay out each party?s obligations.?  For example, renters may be responsible for daily maintenance, while landlords may take care of larger repairs.  On another note, producers who intend to lease buildings for multiple years may want to upgrade the facilities ? such as improving ventilation or feeding systems ? at their own expense, Innes said. In these cases, parties should ensure the agreement specifies ?who these improvements belong to when the lease expires,? he said.  In agreements where renters retain ownership of upgrades, landlords may want to state that the individuals ?will not damage the facilities when removing the equipment,? he added.  Parties can also include termination clauses in these leases.  Renters ?may want to include language that allows them to terminate the lease early provided they give a certain amount of notice? to the landlord, Innes said.  Producers may also want to have the option to terminate these agreements if events, like fires, damage the facilities to a predetermined extent, he said.  Finally, parties may want to discuss their individual liabilities.  ?It?s essential that the lease properly allocates who will be responsible if anything goes wrong,? Innes said. ?For instance, if the person renting misuses manure storage facilities and causes a spill, the landlord will not want to be left responsible for clean up costs.?  Farmers who want to learn more about these leases can reach out to their lawyers.  These professionals can answer ?questions on what issues should be addressed in the lease and how the lease might be best drafted to address any specific concerns the farmer may have,? Innes said.

175,Evaluating Your Capital Debt Repayment Capacity,,https://www.farms.com/ExpertsCommentary/evaluating-your-capital-debt-repayment-capacity-129349.aspx,2017-11-20 2:21:53,"By Brandy Krapf, Dwight Raab, and Bradley Zwilling  Illinois FBFM Association and Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics  University of Illinois  Many financial measures and ratios assist in evaluating the financial health of a business. Not one of those measures itself can assess the overall financial condition of a farm business. It takes a top down review of many of those measures and ratios to make an overall assessment of a farms financial health. See the website of the Farm Financial Standards Council for more information about measuring the financial health of a farm operation (www.ffsc.org). A farm financial consultant well versed in evaluating farm financial health is invaluable in assessing your farms financial health. This article considers only one of those measures, Capital Debt Repayment Capacity (CDRC), as a means to assess the financial health of a farm business.  Capital Debt Repayment Capacity is calculated using select financial information found on the cash flow statement and the accrual income statement. The term CDRC refers to the borrowers  ability to repay term debt in a timely manner. Typically, CDRC is not considered a measurement of a farm or business  performance since CDRC includes non-farm/off-farm sources of income in calculating the repayment ability. The CDRC formula calculates the dollars generated from farm and non-farm sources available to pay debt on time and to pay for capital purchases. CDRC is measured as an absolute dollar value and is difficult to compare among farm operations.  You can calculate your CDRC using the following:  + net farm accrual income  + net non-farm accrual income  + depreciation  - federal/state income and self-employment taxes paid  - family living expense (owner withdrawals)  = Capital Debt Repayment Capacity  Graph 1 depicts the average CDRC of a group of Illinois FBFM farms enrolled in any one of the years for the period from 1995 to 2016. These farms are predominantly grains farm but livestock farms are also included. All lease types are also included. Farm size is limited to those over 500 acres with no limit on the farm size in acres, number of animals or revenue generated.  Summary  From 1995 to 2005 the CDRC moved in a relatively narrow range between $0 and $100,000 without much of a trend evident. The ethanol mandate becomes apparent in the period from 2006 to 2016 with a generally higher level of CDRC but one that is much more volatile. The volatility of the 2006-2016 period is approximately four times the volatility of the 1995-2005 period. This volatility coincides with a period of commodity price change, a general increase in the number of cash rented acres and a general increase in cash rent paid per acre. The volatility is also visible in the low level of CDRC for 2009 (late and wet harvest with lower yields) to the much higher level of CDRC of 2012 brought on by the dry year, low yields and significant crop insurance indemnity payments. Monitor your CDRC closely to maintain a good handle on your farms ability to meet debt payments on intermediate and long term loans. To the extent that your CDRC is in excess of those debt payments, you have the ability to acquire added capital assets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
176,Soybean Export Prospects For 2017-18,,https://www.farms.com/ExpertsCommentary/weekly-outlook-soybean-export-prospects-for-2017-18-129414.aspx,2017-11-21 4:35:32,"By Todd Hubbs  Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics  University of Illinois  U.S. soybean exports will play a significant role in determining soybean prices this marketing year. The recent level of soybean exports from the United States trails last year s pace. The prospect of ending stocks for soybeans once again diminishing throughout the marketing year hinge on increased soybean exports. The development of a lowered ending stock scenario during 2017-18 may require a shortfall in South American production or U.S. exports capturing a greater market share of the world soybean trade.  The current projection for U.S. soybean exports during the 2017-18 marketing year is 2,250 million bushels. This forecast is 76 million bushels larger than last marketing year s total exports. While we are only twelve weeks into the marketing year, exploring the current pace of exports is of value since soybean exports from the U.S. typically slow as the South American soybean crop enters the world market during spring. Census Bureau export estimates are only available for September. September exports came in at 170.5 million bushels, up 32 million bushels over the previous period last marketing year. Census Bureau exports exceeded weekly export inspections by 9 million bushels over the same time. Soybean exports through November 16 equaled 713 million bushels if the margin at the end of September stayed consistent. Soybean export inspections currently trail last year s pace by approximately 12 percent. At this point in the marketing year, export inspections need to average 37.7 million bushels per week to meet the USDA projection. As of November 9, 573 million bushels of soybean had been sold for export but not shipped. The current unshipped export sales number trails the 716 million bushels sold at the same time last year. The pace and sales of soybeans currently lag last year s pace. A brief look at the supply and demand situation can provide clarity on the prospects of meeting or exceeding the USDA projection.  U.S. soybean production is currently projected at 4,425 million bushels for the 2017 crop. This production level is 129 million bushels larger than the 2016 crop and is set to push ending stocks for the current marketing year above 400 million bushels despite the current export projection level. South American production is forecast to be 4.8 percent lower than the 2016-17 production levels. This lower projection is despite a three percent increase in projected harvested acres in the region, mainly driven by an increased prospective planting of soybean acreage in Brazil. The lower production levels occur due to a lower projected yield in the region. Brazil s soybean yield in 2016-17 came in at a record 50.1 bushels per acre, up from the drought-induced 43.1 bushels per acre yield in 2015-16. Current yield projections for Brazil in the 2017 crop sit at 45.9 bushels per acre. While it appears reasonable to assume Brazil will not reach its record yield level again in 2017, the increased production level in the U.S. and expanded acreage in South America provide the prospect of plentiful supplies over the next year.  Export demand over the last decade has been driven by the dramatic expansion of soybean imports from China. Currently, USDA projections for Chinese soybean imports for 2017-18 are 3,564 million bushels. The current level is a 3.7 percent increase from last year s Chinese soybean import estimate. By using data from the USDA s Foreign Agricultural Service, the U.S. share of Chinese soybean imports since the 2010-2011 marketing year averaged approximately 38 percent of total Chinese imports. If we assume this market share for the 2017-18 marketing year, total U.S. exports to China would equal 1,343 million bushels, a mere 11.5 million bushels greater than the 1,331 million bushels exported to China in the 2016-17 marketing year. If China expands imports to 3,764 million bushels as some reports have indicated, a similar calculation of U.S. share comes to 1,385 million bushels. Current projections for other major importers (the European Union, Japan, Mexico, and Southeast Asia) are expected to increase 52 million bushels to 1,112 million bushels for the 2017-18 marketing year. The prospect of meeting the current U.S. soybean export forecast may rely on acquiring a larger market share of the world s soybean import expansion when considering the prospects for crops in South America.  U.S. soybean exports need to continue to build on the strength seen in the 2016-17 marketing year. The ability to exceed the current USDA export projections in 2017-18 is a possibility, but it is heavily dependent on South American production and the continued growth in demand from importers. If major importer demand grows at the projected rate, the soybean export and ending stock projections outlined in the November WASDE supply and demand figures appear to be reasonable approximations for the 2017-18 marketing year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
177,BeefTalk: Let the Cow Save You Money and the Bull Make You Money,,https://www.farms.com/news/beeftalk-let-the-cow-save-you-money-and-the-bull-make-you-money-137673.aspx,2018-08-09 7:36:29,"By Kris Ringwall  Efficient beef production starts when the bull mates with a cow and biological efficiency mates with economic efficiency.  A recent conversation regarding economic drivers in the cow-calf enterprise left me with a lot to think about.  Let me summarize: The thoroughfare to consumers begins with the conception and birth of a calf that slowly morphs into beef. The beef industry is huge, so reflecting is good as the calf moves from the cow-calf producer to other beef enterprises throughout the beef chain.  Focus, Listen and Learn  Much like the source of a mighty river, at some point, only melting snow or raindrops were present. Mighty rivers do not become majestic if the snow does not melt or the rain does not fall. Everything starts somewhere, albeit small, and needs to grow. The cow-calf industry is no different.  Let us consider some thoughts regarding the cow-calf enterprise. Generally, the cow-calf producer has had some cushion between total expenses and market price (positive cash flow). Expenses, however, loom on the horizon as historically high, and given the relative low rates of return on investment, along with the challenges of finding adequate labor, some cattle producers are giving up the reins.  What steps can producers take to improve probability and, ultimately, return on investment? Almost anybody can buy a cow and bull, and produce a calf, but that is not the definition of a cow-calf enterprise. The operation needs to have some scale, and I usually review data that involve operations of 50 or more cows. But today, even 100 cows probably are below the threshold of ?economy of scale.?  I will be the first to state loudly that the cow-calf business has many economic drivers, and ?economy of scale? does not have to be one of them. Why? Cow producers like cows and enjoy the lifestyle of raising beef. But a positive cash flow will put more smiles on the producers? faces.  That being said, how do we do that? Here are some thoughts.  First, recognize the environment one is in and quit fighting it. Building to beat Mother Nature is futile. feed the cows, breed the cows and calve the cows when the weather is right.  The weather is right when cool-season grasses are growing actively. As a consequence of calving when the grass grows, a shift occurs when the third trimester of pregnancy starts, creating the opportunity for alternative winter forage programs.  At the Dickinson Research Extension Center, we turn bulls out on Aug. 1. The third trimester starts Feb. 12, and calving starts May 7. Winter feeds costs, which are 70-plus percent of the total cow-calf costs, have the potential to decline significantly, depending on the extent that ?extensive winter forage? is utilized.  Second, recognize the importance of monitoring cow size. The maintenance of excessively large cows has proven difficult to offset with increased weaning weights. The center has targeted mature cow size at 1,100 to 1,300 pounds. Although individual calf weights will be lighter, total calf weight based on calves produced per acre will be greater, resulting in more total pounds of calf.  Third, recognize the importance of good bull selection using technological advancements that improve accuracy. Generally, keep expected progeny differences (EPDs) above the 50th percentile within the desired traits and breed. As matter of practicality, become comfortable with bulls that are above the 50th percentile but may not exceed the upper 30th percentile for commercial production.  Fourth, recognize the value of breeding systems, maximizing the traits of interest in the terminal sire program while balancing appropriate traits on the maternal side. Let the cow save you money and the bull make you money.  At the center, 1,100- to 1,300-pound cows bred to bulls above the 50th percentile for growth and marbling and in the upper 10th percentile for rib-eye area have an advantage of $26 per acre of ranchland over traditional cows. The calves are summered on forage, and after a short feedlot stay, they are harvested at an average weight of 1,450 pounds, with 94 percent at the ?choice? grade at an average yield grade of 2.9.  The search for the next generation of cow-calf producers has a tremendous opportunity for success, provided some simple targeted goals based on real numbers are put in place. Efficient beef production starts when the bull mates with a cow and biological efficiency mates with economic efficiency.  And just like the majestic river that starts with a few raindrops and a small stream, beef production needs to start with the cow-calf producer. Fishing in the big river may catch some big fish, but do not let fishing tales run the operation.  For new cow-calf producers, the single biggest mistake made is the tendency to work hard physically and set aside the homework. Each cow-calf enterprise is a unique business, and businesses need records.

178,BeefTalk: Sheep and Cows: Some Do and Some Do Not,,https://www.farms.com/news/beeftalk-sheep-and-cows-some-do-and-some-do-not-137709.aspx,2018-08-10 5:57:48,"By Kris Ringwall Driving across the grasslands, one finds oneself asking, ?Who eats all this grass?? Those who live in more urban settings actually ask, ?Who cuts the grass?? Well, we have no need to cut grass because sheep and cows graze, coexisting within the same grasslands, along with other grazing-type animals. Sheep and cows harvest the grass and other plants that provide cover and stability to the soil. Their grazing is very complementary to each other. The forage roots, stimulated by grazing, essentially hold the earth together. Think about it. Who builds homes in a sand pile? Add plants, and stability arrives. That is a good thing. So, back to who does cut grass. In pastures, animals cut the grass. The evolution of this unique and precious relationship is the anchor for animal, plant and soil interactions. Animals eat the grass, stimulating grass plants to spread, wrapping the world in grass and other plants. Animals provide food for humans, who keep the animal population in check. Life is good, and even better when a diverse mixture of plants and animals thrives, each adapting to its unique ecosystem and helping sustain the world. With this diversity comes relationships that generally evolve through time. Time notes the pluses and minuses, working through the various scenarios, some that work and some that do not work.One of those centuries-old relationships is the grazing of various animals on the grasslands, a beneficial relationship because the different types of animals focus their grazing on different aspects of the grasslands. Again, sheep and cows coexist and that is good. If overpopulation does not happen and an adequate annual harvest keeps the populations in check, the grasslands benefit. The world functions well. Back to the challenge. Agriculture is a human activity that includes the growing of plants and animals while maintaining agricultural lands. Do not forget: Sheep and cows coexist. Unfortunately, through time, agriculture has become ?mono-cultural.? The care of plants and animals is simplified, with one plant or one animal type cared for at a time. Missing from this thought process is the symbiotic relationships that different plants and animals have adapted through time to survive. Because these relationships are complicated, an ecosystem approach will not find its way into production agriculture quickly. Grasslands, by their very nature, contain numerous plant types that add diversity, which is good. Range system programs, designed to maintain and enhance plant diversity, work well, although implementation takes some effort. Likewise, a diverse grassland is enhanced by grazing appropriate numbers of different livestock species. Remember the question, ?Why do sheep and cows coexist?? That is why. We should ask, ?Is this real or simply frivolous pondering?? Studies by Mike Humann and Don Kirby at the Dickinson Research Extension Center in 1983 and 1984 evaluated incorporating grazing sheep and cattle together. They noted, ?While cattle are the predominant grazers of range and pasture in the northern Great Plains, sheep offer a significant untapped potential use of this diverse grazing resource. ... Since the mixed-grass prairie provides an abundant variety of classes and species of vegetation, we questioned whether one class of livestock could make efficient use of this varietal abundance.? They found sheep diets complemented the grazing of cattle extremely well. ?The sheep production cycle, breeding, gestation and lactation of ewes compares favorably with the quality of forage selected seasonally by ewes,? they wrote. The biological needs of sheep fit very well with cattle. In 1990, James Nelson and others grazed ewes and cattle at the center, one ewe to every cow. They noted, ?Grazing sheep and cow-calf pairs on native range ... allowed both species to make normal growth without sacrificing either pasture quantity or quality.? Data show the complementary grazing of cattle and sheep is real, but not simple. So why not? As in any process, the conversion of the grasslands from an unfenced to fenced rangeland introduced more challenges to an already complex system. And truth be told, the management of cows and sheep in a confined space is not simple. But having worked with sheep and cattle, and sheep producers and cattle producers, the task is not impossible. The challenge quickly reverts to the willingness to commit a limited time resource weighed against the opportunity to see a dollar return. With sheep and cows, some do and some do not work well together. We hope the some that do work will surface more, allowing production agriculture to take in the built-in efficiencies that Mother Nature already has provided.Source: ndsu.edu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Insects: Maintain aphid control in new and renovated fields- there is very little tolerance for aphids in new fields. Scout for potato leafhoppers in new fields as well. Cyclamen mites: Check for cyclamen mites after renovation if they were a challenge this year. Beneficial mites or Vegol Crop oil could help with cyclamen mite management in late August in more management is needed.  Day neutral strawberry harvest is in progress. Scout and, if needed, manage for tarnished plant bugs, potato leafhoppers, TSSM, and spotted wing drosophila (SWD). Use products that have activity on both SWD and tarnished plant bug, such as Malathion.  Disease: Warm, wet weather will spread anthracnose, and botrytis has been found in day neutral fields. Captan, Maestro and Switch for botrytis control will also control anthracnose. Pristine and Cabrio should be tank mixed with a compatible fungicide rather than used alone for anthracnose control.  If you are applying fungicides for powdery mildew make sure to alternate products from different families. There are a number of products available for powdery mildew control. Check page 195, Publication 360, Fruit Crop Protection Guide.  Blueberries: Blueberry harvest continues. Growers been happy with the season so far. Maintain coverage against SWD from this point on. Apply an insecticide every 5-7 days. Note that the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for Success on blueberries is 1 day. Entrust also has a 1 day PHI, and Malathion has a 2 day PHI. Plan to save a couple insecticide applications to use after a rain.  Exirel and Malathion when applied for SWD will also control Japanese beetle adults.  Raspberries: Summer fruiting raspberry harvest is winding down. Fall-bearing raspberries are blooming in southern Ontario, and harvest will start in a week or two in early areas. SWD is present and control needs to be maintained for the rest of the raspberry season. Plan your insecticide schedule now for fall raspberries. Plan to save a couple insecticide options for re-application after it rains.  Japanese beetles are active. Exirel and Malathion when applied for SWD will also control Japanese beetle adults  Spotted Wing Drosophila (SWD):.  SWD numbers continue to increase.  SWD are not as active in temperatures over 30C which may have worked in our favour in July.  However, SWD prefer the 20-25C temperatures and humid, rainy conditions we?ve been having, and I expect numbers to build quickly in these conditions.  Growers should be maintaining spray coverage and picking as often as possible.  If you have ripe or ripening berries they are at risk and growers should manage for SWD.  For all berry crops pick fruit early, clean and often. Cool fruit as quickly as possible after harvest.  Do not leave overripe or hail-damaged berries in the field. SWD populations can build up in this leftover fruit.  Spray every 5-7 days, and re-apply after a rain- ½ an inch of rain is enough to require a reapplication  Don?t spray in temperatures above 27C.  SWD is more active in the evening and early mornings. Spray from 6-10 am or 6-10 pm if possible.  Always rotate insecticide groups to reduce the risk of developing insecticide resistance.  to reduce the risk of developing insecticide resistance. Research has shown that Assail has some activity on SWD eggs and larvae, but not adults. Assail can be used now to control leafhoppers and tarnished plant buds in day-neutrals, or aphids in raspberries and blueberries.  While we are conducting a small, regional monitoring program, the best way to determine pressure on your farm and evaluate your management program is conducting on-farm monitoring. A salt water test is an effective and easy test. Check out this video for instructions .

181,"Canada earns top marks for veterinary standards, still room for improvement",,https://www.farms.com/news/canada-earns-top-marks-for-veterinary-standards-still-room-for-improvement-137583.aspx,2018-08-06 17:10:55,"OTTAWA - A new report card on animal health says Canada should beef up its quarantine measures and make sure there is no politicking in the food safety system.  The World Organization for Animal Health has just published its assessment of Canada s veterinary standards, focusing on farm animal welfare and disease control. Canada scored top marks overall, meeting the highest level of standard in 35 areas out of 45.  But the report card says there s some room for improvement if Canada wants to make its system air tight and criticism-proof.  The organization says Canada currently has no policy for ""disease-free zoning"" or compartmentalizing of land animals, as defined by the body, and that in a country as big as Canada with high value exports, there s a trade risk posed by the possibility of foreign animal disease.  While there is a zoning program in place for disease outbreaks, the organization recommends Canada develop a permanent program to help mitigate potential risks.  Jaspinder Komal, Canada s Chief Veterinary Officer, said Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) technical staff have already started working with industry partners to see how they can develop more extensive zoning measures.  The report also recommends measures to reduce ""non-scientific"" considerations that compromise policy decisions and to maintain independence, saying sometimes decision making is tainted by strong industry lobby groups.  But Komal insists the CFIA is an arm s-length organization that has adequate authority to make independent decisions and that there s no interference.  ""There may be perceptions because different lobby groups will try and say,  This is how we want things done,  but we continue to work on evidence-based, science-based processes,"" he said.  The assessment also found that while there are a number of disease surveillance programs in place, there is no central information system, which the international animal health organization said would improve efficiency. It also identified a need for a program that traces animals.

183,Chopped Corn Silage Offers Better Control for Beef Producers,,https://www.farms.com/news/chopped-corn-silage-offers-better-control-for-beef-producers-137715.aspx,2018-08-10 6:29:06,"By Linda Geist  Farmers are looking to drought-stressed corn for silage and balage to stretch limited hay supplies.  Chopped corn silage offers beef producers better options than balage, says University of Missouri Extension livestock specialist Gene Schmitz.  Silage allows better control of the amount of high-energy feed for wintering cattle, Schmitz says. Balage offers less flexibility and control of portion size.  ?From a diet perspective, we generally limit corn silage for beef cows to somewhere between 20 to 60 percent of diet dry matter, depending upon the stage of production, body condition and energy content of the silage,? he says.  This prevents cattle from getting too fat and avoids unnecessary feeding costs.  ?It?s almost impossible to limit-feed a bale of corn silage unless it is tub-ground and mixed with grass hay and/or other feed ingredients,? Schmitz says. ?I think it is important to understand this limitation, especially if the silage is carrying some nitrate with it.?  Schmitz says the best silage is finely chopped and tightly packed to get rid of excess oxygen. Cover immediately to protect against the elements, which cause spoilage and nutrient loss. Chop corn when it is still green. Moisture levels must be high enough, generally 60 to 70 percent, for corn to ferment properly. But it should not be too high because then it would become prone to seepage and bacteria.  Pile silage on the ground and pack from all sides to feed, Schmitz says. Avoid putting silage in a hay ?bunker? made out of round bales. It is difficult to rid the silage of oxygen in uncovered bunkers made of bales. Using bale bunkers leads to inadequate packing, shifting of bales during packing and possible tractor rollovers, he says. Schmitz recommends that farmers who want to chop or bale corn should have the corn tested for nitrates at their county MU Extension center. High nitrate content leads to nitrate poisoning in ruminants. He also recommends testing silage for nutrient content and nitrates before feeding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

185,Creating the conditions for crop contentment,,https://www.farms.com/news/creating-the-conditions-for-crop-contentment-137517.aspx,2018-08-02 18:39:49,"By: The OMAFRA Field Crop Team  Dry conditions and insufficient rainfall such as much of the province has experienced this year can make for a stressful season. Rather than casting an envious eye at weather reports from rain-rich regions, we should instead ensure that our own crops have full access to the moisture that is available throughout the soil profile, and that any rainfall we do receive makes it down to crop roots where it is needed. In other words, increasing or maintaining water infiltration, and maximizing root access to soil water by facilitating root growth and exploration.  Water infiltration  The first step in providing crops with adequate moisture is to capture as much as possible by allowing it to infiltrate into the soil. The critical zone here is right at the soil surface.The same soil, in the same field, but with clearly different surface structure. There was no crop residue at the first site, allowing raindrops to pound surface aggregates into individual particles which then filled surface pores, creating a crust as they dried. Soil cover ? dead or alive ? protects the soil from crusting and keeps it open for water infiltration and air exchange. Residue cover feeds soil life that make this possible by continuously aggregates soil particles, as well as deep-burrowing earthworms whose burrows help channel water deeper into the soil. Aim to keep at least 30% of the field covered after planting to achieve these benefits.  Root access to soil water  Moving down from the surface, the critical factors are how much plant-available water the soil can hold, and how well crop roots can access it. Both are related to the porosity of the soil, as well as interrelated factors such as texture  two soils with the same problem. Compaction in the 5-30cm depth range has created a layer of high density and corresponding low porosity. These photos were taken in early July when dry conditions were starting to show consequences. In both cases compaction caused by tillage and traffic created a barrier to roots getting to deeper layers of the profile that contained plenty of moisture.  In soils with higher clay content the compacted layers can become very hard and impede root growth more easily. Heavier soils also hold on to water more tightly, and as compaction reduces the number of larger pores only small pores are left that hold water too tightly for roots to take up.  Increased impedance also changes the way roots grow. They become thicker and can appear flattened as they try to force their way through dense soil layers (fig. 7). In these compacted layers, the proportion of fine roots decreases, further reducing the ability of plants to access water in small pores. The root water uptake rate can be over 60% lower in a heavily compacted layer than a moderately compacted layer. Root growth will be mostly limited to above this layer, exactly where moisture runs out first.  What now?  Having cereals in rotation provides the best opportunity to make amends. Once cereals have been harvested, there is plenty of time to plant a cover crop whichcan go a long way to fixing the problem while also providing nutrient credits. If the problem is with crusting at the surface, focus on covers with plenty of fine, fibrous roots (such as grasses and cereals), but make sure to add a legume, as these will provide biomass that is more available to soil microbes responsible for aggregation in addition to possibly providing nitrogen for the following crop. Adding organic amendments at the same time can supply some or all of the phosphorus and potassium needs of the next crop, as well as increasing organic matter levels in the surface to improve infiltration.  If the problem is compaction, the goal is to pierce channels through this layer that will serve as conduits for water and air, which in turn will allow roots to access the subsoil, its moisture and nutrients. Radishes are an example of a cover crop that has seen steady increase in popularity for this purpose, though it is not the only one. In addition to creating large and deep ?biopores?, research in Maryland by Dr. Ray Weil indicates that deep-rooted cover crops including forage radish can access subsoil nutrients including nitrogen and phosphorus that are then potentially available for the subsequent crop. However, Ontario research has shown that some of these are lost during freeze-thaw cycles, and investigations are ongoing as to whether the addition of a winter-hardy cereal such as rye can mitigate this.  Lastly, some situations require mechanical methods (i.e tillage) to break up dense compacted soil layers completely. These situations would benefit greatly by getting roots growing as soon as possible - while limiting recompaction from traffic - to stabilize this new structure. Best would be subsoiling a summer cover crop after planting, using disks in front of the shanks to minimize surface disturbance. If you do insist on pulling out the deep ripper to handle your compaction problems, I will insist that you please refer to the excellent ? Guide to successful subsoiling ? prepared by the CETAB+ that will help you make sure you are actually achieving your goals and not making matters worse.

187,Damaged crops still usable as feed,,https://www.farms.com/news/damaged-crops-still-usable-as-feed-137582.aspx,2018-08-06 17:02:35,"Beware salvaging weather-stressed and damaged crops for feed as nitrate accumulation could have dire health consequences for ruminant livestock, experts say.  ?Stress such as drought or hail can cause a plant to accumulate nitrates,? explains Trevor Lennox, Saskatchewan Agriculture?s range management extension specialist.  Hail and dry, windy conditions have recently caused crop damage in parts of Saskatchewan and Alberta.  Alberta Ag reports that recent hail storms in the province severely damaged crops, but they could still have value as a feed source.  Caution, however, should be exercised when salvaging damaged oilseed, cereal or hay crops, the department warns.  Ruminants  Normally, rumen animals like cattle, sheep and goats convert the nitrates in forage to nitrite, which is then converted to ammonia and used by rumen microbes to make protein, Manitoba Agriculture explains.  But when nitrate converts to nitrite faster than nitrite converts to ammonia, nitrite accumulates and is absorbed into the bloodstream. There, it binds to hemoglobin and thereby reduces the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood and puts animals at risk of suffocation.  ?You?ll see a lot of laboured breathing, going off feed,? says University of Saskatchewan professor Bart Lardner.  Not all ruminants are at equal risk, and cattle face the greatest threat.  Nitrate poisoning can also have serious repercussions for unborn calves.  Prevention  Barry Yaremcio, Alberta?s beef and forage specialist says nitrate concentrations peak about four days after plant injury, and if the plants recover and begin growing again, nitrate levels can return to normal 12 to 14 days later.  Farmers who suspect nitrates in their feed source can send a feed sample to a feed testing lab, and for around $20, they?ll identify any potential issues, Sask Ag?s Lennox says.  ?If a feed test should indicate high nitrates, in most cases the feed can still be used, but will need to be mixed with another feed source to reduce the nitrate concentration,? Lennox says. ?This should be done in consultation with a livestock nutritionist.?  Also, if a feed is made into silage, the ensiling process can help reduce nitrate levels in the feed, Lennox adds.

188,Drought-Stressed Corn: A Feed Opportunity,,https://www.farms.com/news/drought-stressed-corn-a-feed-opportunity-137661.aspx,2018-08-09 5:25:31,"By Mary Drewnoski  The game of ?what-if? can be tricky. What if the corn crop becomes drought damaged this year? Am I prepared to utilize this forage? Drought-stressed corn will start to wilt and roll its leaves. If drought occurs for four days during the silking and pollination period, the early reproductive stages of the corn plant, as much as 40-50% drop in yield can occur. Cattle producers looking to make use of the drought-stressed corn may harvest it for forage but it should be done with a few considerations.  When harvesting drought-stressed corn to feed, consider:  Chemical labels. If harvesting corn as forage or grazing directly, check the chemical and pesticide labels applied to crops to ensure that the crop is cleared for forage and the minimum pre-harvest interval (PHI) has been met. Nitrate poisoning potential. Drought conditions can prevent normal plant growth, thereby higher levels of nitrates can accumulate in the corn stalk. Nitrates outcompete oxygen in an animal?s hemoglobin and can cause suffocation or even lead to death. Livestock do convert nitrate to other nitrogen compounds in the rumen, but it is the amount consumed and time it took to consume the forage that become the issue. Feedstuffs testing high in nitrates can be used as part of the ration if they are diluted with lower nitrate feeds. Talk with an extension educator about what could be blended and what ration could be balanced.  Drought-stressed corn silage will contain lower levels of grain than normal corn silage.  When harvesting drought-stressed corn as forage, consider these options:  Feeding green. Green chop is chopping corn and feeding it fresh instead of first letting it go through an ensiling process. Nitrates accumulate in the lower 8-12 inches of the standing cornstalk in drought challenged corn. Setting the cutter bar higher and chopping the corn for green chop may lower the amount of nitrate fed. If feeding green chop, feed immediately after harvest and only feed the amount that the animals will consume in two hours. If green chop is left in the bunk or on the wagon, it can heat up and nitrate will be converted to nitrite. Nitrite is 10 times as toxic as nitrate when fed to animals. Therefore, it is better to feed green chop two to three times a day to ensure that it is cleaned up quickly and not left sitting.  Also, ensure that there is plenty of bunk space about 36 inches of space per cow, so the boss cows do not overeat and timid cows are allowed to eat their share. If nitrate poisoning is suspected, remove the contaminated feed from the diet, provide a high energy feed such as corn grain, and call a veterinarian immediately. Green chop may be a potential alternative for feeding some drought stressed corn, but one should do so with care.  Feeding as corn silage. This method is the most widely preferred as the ensiling process reduces nitrate levels by as much as one-half to one-third as the gas escapes as nitrous oxide compounds from the pile. Moisture level is key as excess moisture can lead to poor fermentation or reduced feed value. Proper moisture is 65% with a range of 62-68% moisture. Delay harvest as long as there is some green in leaf and stalk tissue.  Proper ensiling technique is the key to success. Following are several articles on properly ensiling corn silage. Also see the UNL BeefWatch article ? Silage Considerations .? Before using the silage in a ration, it s a good idea to test it for moisture, crude protein, TDN, and nitrate content to allow for proper formulation in a ration. Tips for obtaining a good sample are provided in the NebGuide, Sampling Feed for Analyses YouTube videos from the Silage for Beef Cattle Conference will provide more in-depth information on producing and using corn silage in cattle rations.  Baling corn stover for dry feed. If corn grain is minimal on drought-stressed plants and silage is not an option, baling the corn stover for feed is a final opportunity. Cut the stover at 8-10 inches above the ground when a little green tissue is present and allow to dry down to stover for baling. Nitrates still exist in the corn stover and do not decline as it does in the ensiling process, so caution should be used when feeding. Sending in a sample prior to harvest will allow an initial look at nitrate levels. If nitrate test comes back high and at a dangerous level, cut the plants higher, 8-12 inches off the ground.  Grazing drought-stressed ears. If mechanical harvest is not planned, one can graze the drought-stressed corn standing in the field. Caution should be made in turning cows out to unlimited access of the field. Seasoned cows will seek out the corn ears before forage, meaning the cow will have a high grain diet and an increased risk of acidosis. Ensure that cattle are acclimated by increasing the amount of grain consumed over a week. Cows should not be turned out hungry on drought-stressed corn but should be fed on low nitrate forage beforehand. Also consider feeding high quality hay as a supplement and then moving to the corn field for a period of time during the day.  Cross fencing and strip grazing areas will help limit intake and reduce trampling while turned out on drought-stressed corn. Recall nitrates are an issue with higher concentrations noted as you move from top to bottom of the plant. Do not force cattle to eat lower portion of stalk as that is where highest concentration of nitrates exist. See the UNL article ? Graze Drought Stressed Cornstalks CAREFULLY ? for more information on grazing.  Options exist for utilizing drought stressed corn, but one must look at his/her scenario to determine which situation would work well with the risk taken. Drought-stressed corn can be utilized in several ways with careful management and care in feeding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
189,Experts Advise Cattle Producers to Keep Watchful Eye on Export Markets,,https://www.farms.com/news/experts-advise-cattle-producers-to-keep-watchful-eye-on-export-markets-137674.aspx,2018-08-09 7:44:40,"By Blair Fannin The impact of U.S. beef exports on calf prices continues to rise as experts advise ranchers to stay abreast of trade developments globally.  Randy Blach, CEO of CattleFax in Denver, Colorado, told attendees at the Texas A&M Beef Cattle Short Course in College Station that exports have become an integral part of calf prices and, following the latest trade discussions, are imperative when formulating marketing plans.  Randy Blach, CEO of CattleFax in Denver, Colorado, at the 64th Texas A&M Beef Cattle Short Course.  ?Just look at how fast our export markets have grown since Christmas 2003 when we had BSE,? Blach said. ?We have the opportunity for that value to go as high $500.?  Those prospects are fueled by a strong economy and consumer demand, he said.  ?Consumers across the world want what you produce, which is a safe, reliable, wholesome, high-quality product,? Blach said. ?As we look down the road, I want you to be thinking. are you doing everything you should be doing to deliver the best product??  To put the importance of beef export markets into perspective, Blach said the U.S. exports 17 billion pounds of beef worth $18 billion.  ?That?s $365 in value of the calf you are producing,? he said. ?We?ve really got to keep an eye on these trade situations.?  Industry experts note consumers are wanting more protein at a record pace.  ?We will have record meat consumption in 2019 in the U.S.,? Blach said. ? Never in our history have we consumed more red meat, pork and poultry than we are now. People are eating livestock protein.?  Dr. Jason Cleere, Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service beef cattle specialist, College Station, and Kelley Sullivan, co-owner of Santa Rosa Ranch in Navasota and Crockett, discussed China markets and their potential. Both serve on the Texas Beef Council board of directors and were part of recent visits to China and Japan to learn more about opportunities in trade and share educational programming with representatives in those countries.  Dr. Jason Cleere, coordinator of the Texas A&M Beef Cattle Short Course and Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service beef cattle specialist, College Station.  ?China is encouraging people to eat more red meat,? Cleere said. ?There are 93 people per square mile. Bejing has 22 million people. By comparison, Houston has 6.3 million people.?  A dense population is creating more opportunity for U.S. beef in China as the combination of online and offline retail shopping trends continue. E-commerce continues to drive a majority of the market and with so many people, living quarters are primarily high-rise apartments with small square footage.  ?They don?t have an oven, they a Hibachi type grill and like a very thin-sliced beef product,? Cleere said. ?We need to think about how do we tap into that market with the products we produce.?  Sullivan touted the value of undesirable beef carcass parts in U.S. that are in great demand in Japan and other parts of the world.  ?About $165 to $170 of the check you get from the sale of a calf comes from that export market,? Sullivan said. ?Where that?s coming from are the parts we don?t like, such as beef tongue. In the U.S. we pay $1 a pound, in Japan $6 a pound. Beef intestine, in the U.S. there?s zero value, but it?s $1.50 a pound in Japan. It?s critical to have those export markets.?  Attendees at this week?s short course traveled from across Texas, the U.S. and internationally.  ?What I love about the short course is we learn so many things about specific areas from from cattle marketing, to ranch management, grass management, better care for our cattle and genetic improvement,? said Donnell Brown of RA Brown Ranch in Throckmorton. ?There are so many things. In addition, there?s a great trade show with lots of different products to help us on the ranch. And best of all, you see so many good people ? another record crowd this year.

190,"Financial, Management Benefits of Pregnancy Diagnosis",,https://www.farms.com/news/financial-management-benefits-of-pregnancy-diagnosis-137597.aspx,2018-08-07 4:37:38,"By John F. Grimes    We are entering an exciting time of the year for cow-calf producers. They have started or soon will be weaning their spring-born calves. Weaning is an excellent time to prepare the calf crop to become herd replacements or for future marketing opportunities by implementing health programs and transitioning to feed rations. It is also a great time to determine the pregnancy status of the breeding herd. Management practices for both these groups can go a long way to determine the ultimate profitability of herd.    The factor that should ultimately sort a female to the keep or cull pen is pregnancy status. The three primary methods used in pregnancy diagnosis are rectal palpation, ultrasound evaluation, or blood testing. Each of these methods can effectively diagnose the female?s pregnancy status when properly implemented. Obviously the preferred result is for the female to be pregnant. Pregnancy diagnosis is relatively inexpensive, especially when you consider the potential savings of expenses it facilitates.    While variable costs such as feed may have moderated somewhat in recent years, quality hay may be hard to come by this year making it still fairly expensive to maintain a cow on an annual basis. Producers often fail to consider fixed costs such as machinery, buildings, management, and replacement animal expense. We do not have enough space in this article to debate a sample budget, but it is fair to say the annual carrying costs for a beef female can run from $700 to over $1,000 depending on the situation. An open female is not going to generate any income to help pay the bills.    Carrying an open female over to the next year or the next breeding season only compounds the accumulation of expenses. In nearly every case, the producer would be better off selling the open female and replacing her with a bred female. This is particularly true of yearling females. If you can?t get a properly developed, healthy yearling heifer bred in a 60 -90 day breeding season, sell her as a heavy feeder calf or finish her out to harvest weight. If she is sub-fertile as a yearling, she will likely have fertility problems as a mature female.    At the risk of stating the obvious, the pregnant female is the foundation for any productive cow-calf operation. Hopefully the female will calve within a relatively short calving season window that occurs during the months of the year that are best suited for your operation and time constraints. A pregnant female can also create some additional marketing opportunities for the producer.    Now is an excellent time to evaluate your herd and consider marketing decisions for the fall. First, open cows or heifers can be sold. Young, high quality cattle backed by solid genetics are in demand with potential buyers. Yearling heifers bred artificially to proven calving ease sires are very marketable. It is also a great time to evaluate the body condition of potential sale animals and make nutritional adjustments to the animal?s diet in anticipation of a sale date. It is my experience that while prospective buyers may complain about overly fat breeding cattle, they certainly resist purchasing breeding cattle that are in thin body condition.

191,"For Beef Heifers, Injectable Trace Minerals Improve Mineral Status but Have Variable Effects on Reproductive Performance",,https://www.farms.com/news/for-beef-heifers-injectable-trace-minerals-improve-mineral-status-but-have-variable-effects-on-reproductive-performance-137707.aspx,2018-08-10 5:51:43,"It can be a struggle for beef cattle producers to maintain mineral status, especially for cattle on pasture, so many implement a trace mineral supplementation program. But research on newer trace mineral strategies, including injectables, has been inconsistent and incomplete. In a set of recent studies, University of Illinois animal scientists study the effects of the injectable trace mineral Multimin®90 on reproductive performance in beef heifers. ?We definitely have heard a lot of producers asking, ?What about this product? Does it work?? So we started to do studies on it,? says Dan Shike, associate professor in the Department of Animal Sciences at U of I. In the first study, published in Translational Animal Science, Shike and his research team injected heifers with Multimin®90 at a rate of 1 milliliter per 68 kilograms, 33 days prior to artificial insemination (AI). The heifers were spread out in three herds across Illinois, in Champaign, Simpson, and Baylis. ?In those three herds, we had variable results,? Shike says. ?In two of the herds, we had very good AI conception rates in our controls, so we were already doing well and did not see a response to the injectable. In the last herd, the controls were below where we would like to see. By giving the Multimin®90, there was an improvement in conception rates. In that particular case, it appeared that trace mineral was limiting.? In the second study, in the Journal of Animal Science, Shike and his team injected Multimin®90 into heifers every 90 days from weaning to final pregnancy confirmation, at variable rates according to age, body weight, and label specifications. It is the first published study to evaluate the effects of repeated trace mineral injections. In this case, the injections had no effect on reproductive performance, but selenium and copper status improved compared to animals that received only saline injections. In explaining the result, Shike says it?s complicated. ?In pregnancy, there are so many factors, but the result is either yes or no. In this particular study, the limiting factor was not trace mineral. We had a tougher forage year, so all the heifers were a little lighter, thinner than expected. In this case, overall energy status was likely the most limiting.? Even if it doesn?t make a huge difference in reproductive performance, Shike still sees value in the product because trace minerals play critical roles in overall cattle health and productivity. And ingestible trace mineral products, such as free-choice minerals in pasture-fed cattle, can be hit-or-miss. ?When producers ask about this, my first questions are, ?How have your AI conception rates been? Are you hitting a home run every year?? If so, then you probably don?t have a trace mineral issue. ?But if you?ve had poor AI conception in three out of four years, you need to start evaluating. It may not be trace mineral, but it?s one of the things you should look at. Consider a different mineral program or an injectable. The value of an injectable is you pick the timing and you ensure every animal gets it.? He says that value is worth it to some purebred seedstock producers, who view the injectable as a cheap insurance program. ?If you can get a couple extra pregnancies out of this, you can pay for all your Multimin®90 for a couple of years in these operations.?

194,Getting the most out of cover crops,,https://www.farms.com/news/getting-the-most-out-of-cover-crops-137555.aspx,2018-08-03 15:15:41,"Soil organic matter decline is long-standing issue on farms across the country. The more widespread adoption of cover crops, however, is helping to reverse the trend.  With the right management strategy, cover crops can boost biodiversity, growing conditions, and overall soil health.  Jake Munroe, field crop soil fertility specialist for the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, says farmers can plant different cover crops to accomplish different goals. Those new to cover cropping can start slowly by incorporating a single-species that doesn?t overwinter into their rotation.  Different crops for different needs  If banking nitrogen is the goal, for example, legumes might be the best option. Reducing erosion might require species that develop more biomass. Compaction prevention could start with crops producing large, fibrous root systems such as cereal rye.  Henry Denotter, a grain farmer from Ontario?s far southwest, says he tried a diverse array of cover crop species. One of his most significant issues with growing them in his heavy clay soil is getting the ground uniformly dry and warm before spring planting.  In his experience, the most effective way to ensure good soil conditions at planting is to terminate in autumn.  ?I like to spray early,? he says, and adds that he prefers crops ? like oats ? that can be easily killed with glyphosate. This is because glyphosate does not leave a residue in the soil, meaning he is not limited in what he can plant afterwards.  Kris McNaughton, research associate at the University of Guelph?s Campus in Ridgetown, reiterates that getting the right herbicide formulation is critically important.  Plan ahead  Most single species cover can be eradicated with one or a mixture of two herbicides, she says. The diversity of cover crop blends, though, means developing a herbicide prescription requires more care.  ?You really need to know what you?re going to plant,? says McNaughton when referring to both cover and subsequent cash crop.  ?Roundup should definitely be put on at the two-litre rate. You need something that kills but doesn?t leave a residue. Maybe put in a group one to kill grasses, plus a group four. You should be watching for escapes anyway.?  Blake Vince, another grain farmer from southwestern Ontario, says incorporating cover crops doesn?t require new, expensive equipment either.  Vince has been planting 18-species cover crop mixtures after winter wheat in a no-till system since 2011. Grain crops the following spring are planted into the green cover left by overwintering species. This is done using a standard seed drill with some modifications to help it cut through cover crop residue.

195,Grazing Trampled Grass,,https://www.farms.com/news/grazing-trampled-grass-137593.aspx,2018-08-07 4:04:55,"By Bruce Anderson    How should you graze regrowth in pastures that had tall growth trampled during a previous grazing? I don?t know but I have some ideas.    Grass growth got away from many of us Nebraskans this spring. For some reason the rainfall and temperatures and sunshine all combined to quickly produce so much tall grass that cattle couldn?t eat fast enough.    As good as this sounds, when it came time to graze this tall grass much of it got trampled rather than eaten. As we come back to graze those pastures a second time, there is a combination of new regrowth, tall stemmy grass, dead and brown trampled grass, and partly pushed over but still green old grass. How should that mess be handled?    Animals turned into these pastures with enough time and space will wander around grazing just the regrowth. When that?s all gone they will stand around and beller to be moved to fresh pasture. That may be fine if you have plenty of pasture, but there are other options.    One option that I?m kind of fond of is to increase stock density. In other words, only give the herd part of the pasture at a time. This requires some temporary cross fencing as well as planning regarding water access, but it can be well worth it.    If you increase stock density so your animals have access to about one day?s worth of grazing at a time, grazing and manure distribution will be more uniform. Plus, animals will eat more of the less desirable older forage so carrying capacity will increase. Finally, grass that was trampled previously will be better incorporated into the soil for faster recycling and soil health improvement.    Obviously, either option is acceptable. But if you want to extend grazing and improve conditions for next time, putting a little extra management into the grazing will pay off in the long run.

196,Increasing Retention of May Calving 2-Year Old Heifers in the Cowherd,,https://www.farms.com/news/increasing-retention-of-may-calving-2-year-old-heifers-in-the-cowherd-137570.aspx,2018-08-06 6:14:12,"By Karla Jenkins  Across the Great Plains the end of summer generally brings hot and dry conditions to the region. Both warm and cool season grasses begin to mature and decline in forage quality by late July and August. This decrease in diet quality can present challenges for the May calving heifer, who is still growing and nursing her first calf. The breeding season for May calving cows starts in late July and August. A combination of low quality grass and the increased nutrient demands of lactation and growth for the heifer can result in a nutrient deficiency that reduces the chances of the heifer rebreeding with her second calf.    WHAT?S IN THE GRASS?  For example, the nutrient quality of late summer grass might be 9.3% crude protein and 53% total digestible nutrients (TDN) based on research in predominately warm season perennial species area. Cool season pastures would mature and decline in quality ahead of warm season pastures. Knowing the plant composition of your pastures is important and helps estimate diet quality.    A 2-year old cow weighing 1000 pounds and nursing a calf is estimated by the 2016 Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle (2016 NRBC) to require 690 g of metabolizable protein (MP) and 13 pounds of TDN. Metabolizable protein is protein that not only meets the nitrogen needs of bacteria in the rumen but also meets the growth and lactation needs of the young cow at the tissue level as well.    WHAT DOES SHE NEED?  Assuming this lactating heifer is consuming 22 pounds of dry matter from this grass, she is only consuming 489 g MP and 11.7 pounds of TDN according to the 2016 NRBC model. Providing 2 pounds of dry matter from distillers grains to this young cow, in addition to the grass the heifer is grazing, would provide her approximately 673 g of metabolizable protein and 13.9 pounds of TDN. Meeting her growth and lactation needs puts this heifer in a much better position to rebreed with that critical second calf to keep her in the cowherd.    WHAT WILL IT COST?  The cost of supplementation is dependent on distance hauled and any modifications for ease of handling such as cubing or bagging. However, for comparison the assumption could be made that dried distillers grains could be purchased from the ethanol plant for $150/ton, or from a feed supplier who bagged it for ease of storage and handling for $300/ton. The assumption could also be made a producer wanted to feed lactating heifers for the first 45 days of the breeding season and supply 2.2 pounds of dried distillers each day to each heifer. Assuming $150/ton, not including feed waste or delivery to the heifer, this supplement would cost less than $7.50 per heifer for the 45 days. Assuming $300/ton, the cost would be $15 per heifer for the 45 days. Obviously, if this increased the number of heifers retained in the herd and provided more calves to sell at weaning, then it was a worthy investment.

In fact, he will share with SUNUP host Dave Deeken this weekend that wheat prices are actually higher than they were before the recent rally in grain and commodity markets.  Currently, Anderson reports the price of wheat has climbed nearly a dollar from recent lows up to $5.80, give or take a nickel. Corn is up about 30 cents this week, supporting a forward contract price of $3.50 a bushel. Soybeans are up as well by 60 cents with a current price of right at $8.00, while cotton remains relatively high on the board at 88 cents.  Anderson attributes the weather and resulting lower wheat production as the culprits driving this market rally. Russia?s production woes seem to be the main driver in this situation with a significant drop in production this year compared to last from 3.1 billion bushels total production down to 2.4 billion or so, roughly 15 to 20 percent. However, this is still an average crop for Russia. The EU is also expected to have an average crop, though down about 10 percent in its production. Ukraine, also down by about 5 percent. Australia, however, is forecast to be below average in its wheat crop by 11 percent. Essentially, with less wheat on the market to export, prices are on the rise around the world. Whether or not prices will continue to rise, Anderson says depends on how this story of worldwide production plays out, especially with Australia and Argentina as they continue to wrap their arms around this year?s crop.  In his own opinion, Anderson believes there is the slight chance prices may continue to climb some, but he is fairly certain that the market has reached its top. He advises producers to take advantage of these current market highs and sell a portion of their wheat to capture some of this price point profitability.

198,Know the Feeding Value of Ditch Hay,,https://www.farms.com/news/know-the-feeding-value-of-ditch-hay-137621.aspx,2018-08-08 3:40:12,"Using ditch hay to feed cattle is a common practice across the U.S. It provides livestock producers with a source of readily available forage which can be very useful particularly during feed shortages. ""Under ideal conditions, it would be advisable to analyze the bales at least for crude protein and total digestible nutrients (TDN) and balance diets accordingly,"" said Alvaro Garcia, SDSU Extension agriculture and natural resources program director & professor. However, he added there is quite a large variability in nutrient content and using average nutrient composition values can oftentimes result in unbalanced diets and reduced cattle performance. The reason for this variability however doesn t seem to be as much the plant species composition, but rather the time of harvest. During 2015, NDSU Extension analyzed 182 samples of harvested ditch hay from across the state. The results showed that most of the ditch hay consisted of cool-season grasses, predominantly smooth bromegrass. There were differences in nutrient composition that were attributed mostly to variability in the stage of maturity at cutting. ""The best compromise between tonnage and quality seems to be when ditch hay is harvested precisely during early July,"" Garcia said. Safety first  When determining whether to harvest ditch hay, it is very important to thoroughly inspect the area to make sure that the ditch is tractor-safe, and will not result in a dangerous rollover. Also, review the area for litter that may have accumulated such as glass bottles, aluminum cans, plastic, etc. It is important to know whether the roadsides have been sprayed for weeds. ""Some herbicides are not cleared to be used on forage that is to be fed to livestock,"" Garcia explained. ""And, some broadleaf herbicides sprayed on ditch hay fed to cattle are eliminated intact in the manure. Which could mean that if manure from animals fed ditch hay sprayed with these herbicides is applied to the fields, there is a good chance the herbicide will hurt yields or even the whole subsequent broadleaf crop."" Current suggestions are to skip at least two growing seasons before planting broadleaf crops to acreage that was fertilized with manure from these animals. There have not been health issues reported in cattle fed hay treated with herbicide.

Judge Earl Britt, of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, in late June imposed the gag order on the parties, lawyers and potential witnesses in lawsuits brought against Murphy-Brown, the hog production subsidiary of Smithfield Foods. The judge said a ?significant increase in trial publicity? and the ?volume and scope of prejudicial publicity? about the first two cases ? one decided in early May and the other two days after the gag order was implemented ? could taint future jurors.  NPPC and NCPC filed an amicus curiae brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Va., asking that it grant Murphy-Brown?s petition to vacate the District Court?s prior restraint on speech, noting that ?All but the most carefully crafted, narrow gag orders are unconstitutional.?  The pork organizations argued that there is no compelling need for the gag order, the District Court did not consider alternatives to the order ? including the jury selection process or jury instructions ? the order is overbroad and vague, and it won?t be effective. On the latter point, they said it?s ?not reasonable to think that any gag order will reduce coverage of these cases or blunt the public?s interest? in them.  In fact, there has been extensive coverage of the lawsuits from media outlets in the state and around the country and from advocacy groups and people outside the scope of the gag order.  ?The greatest risk of [jury] prejudice,? NPPC and NCPC argued, ?isn?t the existence of publicity. it is the existence of one-sided publicity that has resulted from the gag order. ??  ?As we pointed out in our friend-of-the-court brief, this gag order has had a chilling effect on all hog farmers in North Carolina,? said NPPC President Jim Heimerl, a pork producer from Ohio. ?As potential witnesses, they?re prohibited from saying anything about or defending their operations, while those opposed to hog farming are free to attack those farmers in the press.?  In three of the nuisance cases decided over the past three months, including one last week, juries have levied a combined $99 million in compensatory and punitive damages against family farmers over noise and odors from their hog farms. A total of 26 lawsuits have been filed.

201,Love Food Hate Waste,,https://www.farms.com/news/love-food-hate-waste-137741.aspx,2018-08-10 17:21:51,"This summer, the federal government launched the Love Food Hate Waste (LFHW) campaign with the goal to inspire and empower people to make their food go further for them and ultimately to reduce household food waste.  Canada?s Love Food Hate Waste campaign is modeled after the same campaign in the United Kingdom. In the UK, the campaign has been proven to change behaviour: the UK cut avoidable food waste by 21 percent in its first five years. UK consumers were able to save 13 billion Euros in that time.  The LFHW website offers several surprising statistics on Canada?s food waste. For example, 47% of Canada?s food waste comes from households, the average Canadian throws out 170kg of food every year, and 60% of the food that Canadians throw away could have been eaten.  The Commission for Environmental Cooperation explains that when we include the food waste that occurs in the rest of the supply chain, Canada wastes 396kg of food per person annually. The Love Food Hate Waste website offers an in-depth look at the food that is wasted in Canada every year.  The economic costs of the food that is wasted in the process from growing it to eating it is estimated at $30 billion every year and not only does this cost Canadians money, but it also has severe environmental impacts. At 396kg of food wasted per capita, Canadians are producing 21 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions each year. Rather than generating these emissions at landfills, the CFFO would like to see food waste composted and used as soil amendments.  In their pursuit to help reduce food waste in Canada, the LFHW campaign offers plenty of guidance and education for Canadian consumers through things like their waste-free summer produce guide, fridge guide, freezer guide, and shelf life calculator, and tips for using up food.  Food waste is a serious problem. It plays a role in numerous issues, one being its impact on farmers. Farmers pay the full costs of production and are only reimbursed for what they can sell. The food industry?s pursuit of volume over quality is a core contributor to overproduction, and it may be time to consider higher quality products for less waste and higher profits.  With so much food being wasted, the CFFO also sees opportunity to do good. That $30 billion worth of lost food could be used to help those in need. Every month, roughly 850,000 people use food banks in Canada. Luckily, Ontario was one of the first provinces to implement a tax credit for farmers donating to food banks and the Ontario Association of Food Banks has a helpful brochure.  As one of the world?s worst contributors to food waste, Canadians need to do better.

202,Manitoba Agriculture Early Yield Reports Average,,https://www.farms.com/news/manitoba-agriculture-early-yield-reports-average-137654.aspx,2018-08-08 18:59:59,"Farmscape,  Manitoba Agriculture reports yields on the earlier harvested crops are coming in at about average.  Manitoba Agriculture released its weekly crop report yesterday.  Anastasia Kubinec, the Manager of Crop Industry Development with Manitoba Agriculture, reports harvest is widespread throughout the regions, except for the northwest and into the southwest.  Clip-Anastasia Kubinec-Manitoba Agriculture:  Producers are getting average yields in winter wheat, fall rye, field peas.  That s the majority of crops that have been harvested.  Weather over the past week has been a little bit variable.  We had a bit of a cool down which was much appreciated by the crop.  We had some moisture, we had some very cool evenings too which helped some of the crop recuperate from high temperatures but, over the weekend, we had some significant hail storms go through and a tornado which did cause some crop damage in some areas.  In some of the earlier crops, rain is now too late.  They ll be taken off.  Any rainfall that does occur is not going to help them fill.  In later crops we are seeing some wilting symptoms in some of the full season crops like soybeans, corn, sunflowers.  A little bit of precipitation does temporarily alleviate that.  We are starting to see some of the effects of the long term dry and very hot conditions that we have seen this summer.  With the hail that fell over the weekend, it varied from insignificant damage to very high damage.  In the Interlake they do have areas that were very hard hit and inspectors and insurance companies are out with producers currently and they re assessing the amount of damage that has occurred to those crops.  Kubinec says, for most crops, disease has not been an issue in 2018 but, as a result of the dry weather, grasshoppers are moving from ditches into crops and farmers are still monitoring for things like bertha armyworms and spider mites.

203,Mixed Seeding of Winter and Non-winter Hardy Annual Forages,,https://www.farms.com/news/mixed-seeding-of-winter-and-non-winter-hardy-annual-forages-137619.aspx,2018-08-08 3:31:29,"By Jerry Volesky August to early September is a time when some producers are planting various annual forages or cover crop mixtures for fall forage. This typically includes non-winter hardy small grain cereals such as oats and spring varieties of triticale, barley, or wheat. Brassicas such as turnips, rape, or kale can be mixed with these small grain cereal grasses. Most brassicas have high energy content even when mature and tend to maintain their quality later into the winter than the small grain cereal grasses. Another option to this practice can be to plant a mixture of winter hardy and non-winter hardy species in order to have both fall and spring forage from a single planting operation. Common winter-hardy species include cereal rye, winter wheat, triticale, or barley. Any of these, paired with a non-winter hardy species, can result in a several different 2-way combinations (Figures 1 https://go.unl.edu/pzjg and 2 https://go.unl.edu/787h). Several 2-way non-winter hardy and winter hardy mixtures were evaluated in recent plot trials at the UNL West Central Research and Extension Center in North Platte (Table 1 https://go.unl.edu/9t4z). For each species in the mix, they were planted at one-half the seeding rate of what would be used for a monoculture planting. In a rye and oats mix for example, oats were seeded at a rate of 1 ½ bushels per acre and rye at 1 bushel per acre. Monocultures of the different species seeded at the full rate were also included for comparison purposes. Including the non-winter hardy species (oats, spring triticale, turnips) significantly increased fall forage yield in all cases. Spring yield of the winter hardy species (rye and winter triticale) in monocultures at full seeding rate was higher that than their respective yield in the 2-way mix. Overall, total yield of winter hardy and non-winter hardy mixtures was similar to that of the winter hardy monocultures. While the non-winter hardy forages could be replanted in the spring, mixing the non-winter hardy and winter hardy species in a late summer planting will result in more fall forage and a moderate amount of early spring forage from the winter hardy species. all from a single planting operation.

205,Olive Oil Extracts May Reduce Stress in Weaned Calves,,https://www.farms.com/news/olive-oil-extracts-may-reduce-stress-in-weaned-calves-137664.aspx,2018-08-09 5:54:27,"By Lautaro Rostoll  Fig. 1. Heifers fed olive oil bioactive extracts (OBE) at the NFREC Feed Efficiency Facility. Feed intake was measured daily using the GrowSafe feed intake monitoring system.  The fact that stress is detrimental to animal performance is a well-known concept in beef cattle production. The impact of stress on cattle is observed at various levels, and it can have multiple consequences, all of them ultimately affecting growth and performance. Stress is a very complex process to define and can take place in many different forms. During a stress event, the animals may experience an inflammatory process that ultimately leads to the overproduction of certain types of proteins called pro-inflammatory acute phase proteins. These proteins have a very important role in mounting the immune response needed to fight the stressor. Some are directly involved in recruiting immune cells to the inflammation site, others inhibit microbial growth, and all of them ultimately help in decreasing the negative impact on performance. However, the production of these proteins has a cost in terms of nutrient use efficiency, and these nutrients are diverted away from productive processes into fighting an inflammatory process.  Cattle may experience stress due to excess heat, digestive upsets such as bloat and acidosis, transport, weaning, castration, and many other processes. Often, many of those processes occur almost concurrently in our typical beef production systems, creating an additional challenge that can lead to increased morbidity and decreased animal performance. The majority of the 800,000 beef calves that are born annually in Florida leave the state in a truck heading to a backgrounding, stocker, or feedlot facility, and in many cases the calves are weaned and trucked in the same day. For this reason, any opportunities to mitigate weaning and transport stress could have an impact on the post-weaning performance of Florida calves, potentially enhancing their economic value.  Olive Oil Bio-extracts  In 2017, the University of Florida, North Florida Research and Education Center (NFREC) began a series of research projects aimed at investigating the potential of olive oil bioactive extracts as a potential feed additive to mitigate stress in cattle. The idea stems from a series of studies conducted in pigs and in rodents, in which certain compounds purified from the olive trees, including fruits, leaves and stems have shown anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. These compounds are part of one of the largest classes of plant natural products, known as pentacyclic triterpenes and they are isolated from pomace oil, which is the residue left after olive oil extrusion. In order to test the potential of these compounds as a novel feed additive for newly weaned beef calves, at NFREC we conducted a series of in vitro (in the laboratory) an in vivo (in the animal) studies. In this edition of the Panhandle Ag e-newsletter, we will share the results of the in vivo trials.  The NFREC study  A group of 36 newly weaned Angus crossbred heifers (463 lb of BW) from the NFREC herd were assigned to the study. The heifers were housed at the NFREC Feed Efficiency Facility and were fed a common backgrounding diet comprised of corn gluten feed (61%), cottonseed hulls (32%), molasses (4%) and a mineral premix (3%) containing, or not, the olive oil bioactive extracts (OBE) tested at either 0.04 or 0.16% of the diet DM (Figure 1). After 21 days receiving their respective dietary treatments, the heifers began a period of 12 days during which they were challenged every other day with an intravenous dose of a lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is a common endotoxin produced in the rumen. When the LPS in the rumen translocate to the blood, it causes an inflammatory response that is characterized by a decreased feed intake and increase body temperature, among other responses. This model was used to simulate a subacute chronic inflammatory process, and then be able to test the potential of OBE in mitigating that inflammatory stress.  To make sure that the model was successful in creating the inflammatory process, a group of heifers received the control diet and was not challenged with the LPS, receiving only a saline solution injection. Thus, the four treatments tested (9 heifers per treatment) were: 1) a negative control group not fed OBE and not challenged with LPS (CTLNve). 2) a positive control group, not fed OBE and challenged with LPS (CTLPve). 3) heifers fed OBE at 0.04% of the diet DM (OBE1). and 4) heifers fed OBE at 0.16% of the diet DM (OBE4). Heifers were bled every other day during the challenge to measure blood parameters indicative of an inflammatory process, and an intravaginal device was inserted to measure temperature continuously every 5 min for the 12 days of the LPS challenge.  Results from the study show that feeding OBE, particularly at the greater inclusion level, had positive effects on vaginal temperature after the endotoxin challenge (Figure 2). Additionally, the increase in the concentration of the acute phase protein haptoglobin in plasma following the endotoxin challenge was moderated in heifers fed OBE, showing a positive effect on decreasing the acute phase response (Figure 3). This was also evidenced by an increase in dry matter intake in heifers fed OBE when compared to control. Several other measurements such as liver biopsies, and many other blood parameters were conducted in this experiment to fully understand the mode of action of these bioactive extracts and are currently being analyzed. These preliminary results are very promising and are consistent with the findings in mice and pig models receiving these types of novel feed additives.  Figure 2. Effect of feeding olive oil bioactive extracts (OBE) on vaginal temperature in heifers challenged intravenously with LPS (endotoxin).  Figure 3. Effect of olive oil bioactive extracts (OBE) feeding on blood concentrations of the acute phase protein haptoglobin. A decrease in the concentration of this protein shows a positive effect of the supplement on moderating the acute phase response.  Take home message  This first study shows promising results in terms of the potential of olive oil bioactive extracts as a potential novel feed additive to enhance productivity in newly weaned cattle. A reduction in the acute phase response was observed in heifers fed OBE for 21 days prior to an endotoxin challenge. This was consistent with an increase in dry matter intake and with improvements in several blood parameters indicative of a potentially enhanced immune status. Feeding olive oil bioactive extracts may provide an opportunity to enhance the value of Florida calves, by including them in a preconditioning program post-weaning, or prior to shipping to improve subsequent animal performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
206,"OMAFRA Crop Report ? Week of August 6, 2018",,https://www.farms.com/news/omafra-crop-report-week-of-august-6-2018-137695.aspx,2018-08-09 19:24:37,"2018 has been an insect year. As we start to approach the end of summer, there are still a few pests to be concerned about before the crops are ready for harvest.  Western bean cutworm (WBC): Overall, the WBC population have been lower than previous years. With the majority of the corn crop beyond the fresh silk stage in the most southern five counties, corn trap catches have dropped considerably in that area. Peak flight has occurred one to two weeks ago in that region. Traps in Oxford to Bruce and Grey, across to Brant are still seeing some decent catches and will likely peak this week. Compared to previous years, Haldimand and Norfolk have experienced very low populations, as has the hot spot area around Bothwell. Fields in central and eastern Ontario may still see some egg laying in later planted corn that is still in the tassel to fresh silk stages over the next two weeks. Early corn planting and scouting is really paying off this year in corn, as many fields have had few egg masses in them and many beneficial insects have been waiting to help reduce the WBC population as they arrive. At the same time, trap captures from dry bean fields have increased significantly in the last two weeks. In fact, the average trap catch in dry beans has exceeded that of previous years. This is due to the moths being more attracted to dry bean fields when corn is beyond their favoured stages. Dry bean fields that are in the flowering to pod stages are most at risk now. Especially those counties that have not reached peak flight yet including Oxford, Perth, Huron, Bruce, Wellington, Waterloo, Brant, Simcoe and Grey. As scouting for WBC in dry beans is difficult and ineffective, spray is warranted if dry bean traps have accumulated at least 150 moths per trap. Timing of application should occur after peak flight has occurred in your area, and only once pods are developing on the plants.  Figure 1: Bean leaf beetle adult and pod damage. H Bohner, OMAFRA  Bean leaf beetle (BLB): There was a surprising number of overwintering BLB adults this spring, which mate and lead to the first generation adults that enter pod stages of beans this time of year. This pest is only a concern for IP, food grade and seed soybeans as well as dry beans. Leaf feeding is not really the issue at this point. it is the pod feeding that can introduce pod diseases and impact seed quality (Figure 1). For IP, Food Grade or Seed Soybeans, if 10% of the pods on the plants have feed scars on them during the R4 to early R6 stages, a spray is warranted. For Dry Beans, with higher value and stringent quality standards, if 5%?8% of the pods inspected have feeding scars, control may be necessary. If pods are being clipped and found on the ground throughout the field in either crop, an application is also warranted. Ensure that adults are still presently active in the field before spraying and consider days to harvest intervals when selecting which products to use.  Stink bugs and tarnished plant bugs : The easiest to spot ?bugs? found right now have been stink bugs (Figure 2) and tarnished plant bugs. Both adults and nymphs feed directly on pods and seeds of soybeans and dry beans, using their piercing and sucking mouthparts. As they pierce the pods, they inject digestive enzymes into the seeds, causing the seed to dimple or shrivel, resulting in picks. The feeding wound provides an avenue for diseases to gain entry into the pod and seed quality is reduced. Indirect effects of stink bug feeding can include delayed maturity ? green bean syndrome ?of injured plants, though stink bugs are not the only cause for green bean syndrome. For these two pests, a sweep net is the best tool to assess populations as they are fast moving. Take 20 sweep samples (in a 180° arc sweep) in five areas of the field and determine the average number of adults and nymphs per sweep by dividing the total count by 100. In IP, Food Grade or Seed Soybeans and Dry Beans, control is warranted if an average of 0.2 stink bugs per sweep is found (or 20 bugs in 100 sweeps) in R4 to early R6 stage beans. Even in crush beans, control may be warranted if an average of 0.4 stink bug adults or nymphs per sweep is found during these stages.  Figure 2. Brown and green stink bug adults, respectively. T. Baute, OMAFRA  Tarnished plant bugs tend to prefer dry beans and warrant control if an average of one to two tarnished plant bugs (nymphs or adults) per sweep is found during the pod stages.

208,Sask. farmers face scorching temps,,https://www.farms.com/news/sask-farmers-face-scorching-temps-137642.aspx,2018-08-08 12:21:50,"Public weather alerts issued across the Prairies and farmers are feeling the heat  By Kate Ayers  Staff Writer  Farms.com  Producers in Saskatchewan are gearing up for earlier harvests as temperatures soar into the mid-30s this week.  The southwestern and western regions of the province will see high temperatures today, which will move east Thursday and Friday, an Environment Canada statement said today.  This heat has ?brought the crops on quickly,? Todd Lewis, Agricultural Producers Association of Saskatchewan president, said to Farms.com today.  ?Pea harvest has started, and desiccation of chickpeas has been done already, which is pretty unheard of in August. It speaks to how dry the soil conditions are and those plants are shutting down.?  Maximum temperatures are expected to reach between 32 and 36 C during the day and will remain in the mid-teens overnight through the week and into the weekend.  The extreme heat is affecting both cash croppers and livestock producers.  ?The heat this week is damaging what little hay is out there,? Lewis said.  ?The feed shortage situation is fairly dire in a lot of local areas. ? Producers have been going far and wide to do haying in the ditches and road allowances. They are looking for pastures in the northern part of the province as well.?  Government programs like Crop Insurance and AgriStability are available to help with poor yields and feed shortages, Lewis said, but these payments are not immediate.  Farmers should take precautions this week to prevent heat stroke or heat exhaustion while working outside.  Environment Canada suggests:  taking frequent breaks from the heat, spending time indoors in cooled buildings  drinking plenty of water and other non-alcoholic, non-caffeinated beverages to stay hydrated  More information on how to stay cool and safe during this extreme heat event can be found here and a full list of heat warnings and special weather statements can be found here .  Producers can expect relief from the high temperatures early next week.  georgeclerk/E+ photo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
209,Scouting and Managing Soybean Aphids,,https://www.farms.com/news/scouting-and-managing-soybean-aphids-137526.aspx,2018-08-03 5:47:34,"By Wayne Ohnesorg  Soybean aphids in Nebraska usually reach the economic threshold and require treatment in late July (rarely) through August, with a very few fields requiring treatment earlier in July. Treatment during this period usually is enough to keep aphid populations from resurging because there is not enough time for populations to build up before they would naturally leave the fields in late August and early September.  The earlier a field is treated, the greater the chance that any surviving aphids can later reproduce or new aphids can repopulate the field. And remember, insecticide treatment also kills many natural enemies, so any aphids that do re-infest a field are not constrained by predators and other natural controls. Even insecticides with a relatively long residual cannot last when insecticide treatment is done in early or mid-July, particularly during a year when aphid populations are thriving. There would also be no residual on new vegetative growth occurring after the treatment was applied. If one has to treat early, make sure to closely monitor the field until early September.  An unwarranted insecticide treatment can also contribute to aphid population resurgence, either because fields were treated well before the threshold was met or fields were treated along with an herbicide (in some cases a fungicide), regardless of aphid presence. These treatments kill natural enemies and are usually done relatively early so there is plenty of time for aphids to resurge or re-colonize a field. Aphid populations below or even at the economic threshold do not cause yield loss, so treating before populations reach 250 aphids/plant only increases the probability of aphid resurgence. In addition, we have observed that many fields support a non-increasing, low population of aphids (e.g., less than 100 aphids/plant) through August. Treating these fields would be a waste of time and money. Tank mixing insecticides with glyphosate or other herbicides can be problematic because application methods for herbicides (e.g., lower pressures, large droplet producing nozzles) are not optimal for good insecticide efficacy. Tank-mixing with fungicides can be effective because application methods for fungicides and insecticides require high water pressure for adequate penetration and coverage, however, only conduct this practice if soybean aphid thresholds are met.  Scouting Methods  There are two methods to scout and determine if an insecticide treatment is warranted. a conventional scouting method using the 250 aphid/plant economic threshold and a speed scouting method.  The Conventional, 250-Aphid-per-Plant Method  Begin scouting soybean fields once or twice a week in late June/early July. Check 20 to 30 randomly selected plants in various areas of each field. Aphids are most likely to concentrate at the very top of the plant, although they will move onto stems and within the canopy as populations grow and/or the plant reaches mid to late reproductive stages. If a tree line or woodlot is adjacent to the soybean field, make sure and include a few sampling locations near these areas. Soybean aphids are often found first in the parts of soybean fields near wooded areas.  Counting aphids is not as difficult as it may at first seem. First, walk to a random spot in the field. Pull a plant and turn it upside down and give it a quick scan to see where the aphids are located. Get a feel for what 10 or 20 aphids look like and count by 10s or 20s.  The current threshold for late vegetative through R5 stage soybean is 250 aphids/plant with 80% of the plants infested and populations increasing (see above for details). Thresholds for early R6 have yet to be determined, but are likely in the 400-500 aphids/plant range. Insecticide treatment done during or after mid-late R6 has not been documented to protect yield.  The Speed Scouting Method  This method uses a spreadsheet adapted from a sampling plan developed by the University of Minnesota (Hodgson, E.W., E.C. Burkness, W.D. Hutchison, and D.W. Ragsdale. 2004. Enumerative and Binomial Sequential Sampling Plans for Soybean Aphid (Homoptera:Aphididae) in Soybean. J. of Econ. Entomol. 97(6): 2127-2136). It is different from conventional scouting in that it relies on the number of ?infested? plants. Plants are considered ?infested? when there are 40 or more aphids on a plant. The scout does not have to count or estimate the number of aphids on a plant to determine whether it has reached the threshold of 250 aphids per plant. One simply determines if a plant is infested and enters this in the spreadsheet. The spreadsheet then recommends further scouting or treatment options based on the number of ?infested? plants in a given area.  This tool is freely available as a web accessible UNL Extension Circular EC1582 Aphid Speed Scout ( http://extensionpubs.unl.edu/publication/9000016368033/soybean-aphid-speed-scouting-spreadsheet/ ) to be used in the field on mobile devices (e.g. smart phone, computer, iPad) or as a free iPad App available in the iTunes store at Aphid Speed Scout (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/aphid-speed-scout/id454600279?mt=8).  General Management Guidelines  Look for the presence of aphid natural enemies such as lady beetles, green lacewings, insidious flower bugs, aphid mummies, fuzzy aphids, and other insect predators. Predators and parasitoids may keep low or moderate aphid populations in check. One can often find soybean aphids by examining plants where lady beetles are observed.  Take note of winged aphids or ?broad-shouldered? nymphs. Nymphs with broad or squared-off shoulders will become winged adults. A magnifying glass is helpful to see the ?broad-shouldered? nymphs, but the winged adults are easy to see. If the majority of aphids are winged or developing wings, the aphids may soon leave the field and treatment can be avoided.  If the plants are covered with honeydew or sooty mold, or stunted, and aphids are still present at threshold levels, an insecticide treatment may still be of value but the optimum time for treatment has passed.  Good insecticide coverage and penetration is required for optimal control of soybean aphid because aphids feed on the undersides of the leaves and within the canopy. For ground application use high water volume (?15 gallons/acre) and pressure (?30 psi). Aerial application works best when high water volume is used (?3 gallons/acre).  Several insecticides are labeled for the soybean aphid. A list of registered insecticides, rates, preharvest intervals, etc. can be found at http://entomology.unl.edu/insecticides-control-soybean-aphids Pyrethroids have a relatively long residual, and work best at temperatures below 90º F. Organophosphates have a fuming action, and may work well in heavy canopies or high temperatures. Dimethoate is least effective.  Spraying flowering soybean poses a threat to honey bees. Communicate treatment plans to nearby beekeepers and follow label precautions to minimize honey bee kills. When there is concern about honey bees, pyrethroids are the better insecticide choice and spraying late in the day is preferred.  Don t Spray Too Early  Recently, we have seen or heard of alternative, and much lower, soybean treatment thresholds being promoted in newsletters and on social media. We do not support these extremely low thresholds because treatment would occur too early and could result in aphid resurgence, recolonization, increased insecticide use, and unnecessary insecticide use (and waste of money). But most importantly, they are not founded on a solid, peer-reviewed research base.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
210,Starting Newly Weaned Calves on Feed,,https://www.farms.com/news/starting-newly-weaned-calves-on-feed-137559.aspx,2018-08-06 3:39:14,"By Erin Laborie   Proper management during the receiving phase is critical to overall health and long-term performance of cattle in the feedlot. Newly weaned calves are faced with the stress of separation from the cow, deprivation of feed and water during transportation, and adaptation to the feedlot environment. Whether calves are being introduced into a backgrounding or finishing program, implementing low-stress management practices to ensure this is a smooth transition for incoming calves becomes a major priority.    WATER  Considering water intake heavily influences feed intake, calves should have unlimited access to clean water. Some calves have only drunk water from ponds or tanks, so they will not recognize automatic or ball waterers. Allow water to overflow or use an open waterer to promote water intake.    FEED DELIVERIES  Long stem, grass hay is a recognizable feedstuff to calves and should be placed in the bunks prior to arrival. Providing a mixed ration at approximately 0.75% of body weight on a dry matter basis for the first day?s feed delivery and progressively working up to 2.5% of body weight within 14 ? 28 days is an effective strategy whether calves are fed a series of step-up diets or program fed the final diet. The amount of time it takes to reach the target intake will depend on the risk level and background of the calves. When transitioning from one step-up diet to the next, deliver the same pounds of dry matter as the previous day?s feed delivery to avoid depressing intake. Delivering a consistent ration at the same time each day can help mitigate digestive upsets and maintain target feed intakes as well.    DIET COMPOSITION  Since intakes are relatively low during the receiving phase, the diet should be formulated with palatable, high-quality feedstuffs. Receiving diets should be low in starch and consist of highly digestible fiber sources. Avoid feeding cheap feeds or by-products that vary in composition. Inclusion of silage in receiving diets should be limited as it is not a familiar feedstuff to calves and may lead to clostridia problems. Calves do not tolerate nonprotein nitrogen sources such as urea. Plant protein sources such as soybean meal, canola meal, or cottonseed meal are preferred. Vitamins and trace minerals, such as vitamins A and E, zinc, and copper, play an important role in immune function and should be provided at appropriate levels for stressed calves.    PROCESSING  With regards to transit time, allow calves to rest prior to processing. It is well known that vaccinating stressed calves results in a poor vaccine response. Practice low-stress cattle handling at all times and use working facilities that are appropriate for processing calves. Consider delaying administration of implants until calves are on a steady plane of nutrition.    CONCLUSION  Developing a receiving protocol can help feedlot operations better prepare for incoming calves. Work closely with your nutritionist to ensure receiving diets meet the requirements of newly weaned calves. Not only is proper bunk management a key component for efficiently starting calves on feed but also maintaining target intakes throughout the feeding period. Management during the receiving phase should not be overlooked as it sets the stage for long-term performance of cattle in the feedlot.

Haley says cattle can legally be on a truck for 48 hours.  ""For the loads that we surveyed, they were on route for, on average, 28 hours when they stopped for feed, water and rest. Cattle are being rested for, on average, just over 11 hours, where as the law requires five hours of rest. So the industry practice is more than double that amount of time.""  Their research showed 61 per cent of loads were feeder calves, 21 per cent weaned calves, and 15 per cent were cattle at market weight.  Haley says it s important to know the provincial and federal legislation for transporting animals even if you ve hired a professional carrier to transport your animals.  ""After all, they are your animals. So be part of the conversation about how to get animals to their destination safely, and in the best shape possible. Know what animals can and cannot be loaded and what condition might preclude an animal from being transported, or what animals might require special provisions for being transported.""

212,SWD Update August 2018,,https://www.farms.com/news/swd-update-august-2018-137585.aspx,2018-08-06 17:26:37,"This post contains a summary of trap counts for the week of August 3. Please refer to previous blog posts for counts from earlier in the growing season. The regional monitoring program is being conducted in berry and stone fruit crops and grapes in Essex, Chatham-Kent, Elgin, Norfolk, Niagara, Wellington, Durham, Ottawa/Carleton, Stormont/Glengarry/Dundas and Northumberland counties. The monitoring project is a collaboration among the Niagara Peninsula Fruit and Vegetable Growers, Ontario Tender Fruit Growers, the Eastern Ontario Berry Growers, OMAFRA staff and private consultants.  Traps are being moved from harvested crops into day neutral strawberry, raspberry and blueberry and stone fruit (yellow plum, apricot, peach, nectarine, blue plum). We have placed 3-4 traps with commercial SWD lures at each site. Use these results in addition to your own monitoring program to determine when SWD is present on your farm. Conduct a salt water test or a plastic baggie test to confirm presence of larvae in fruit.  SWD has been identified in traps in all monitored counties as of August 3. This means that growers with ripening crops susceptible to SWD should consider using a product with activity against swd in preharvest sprays. Check the SWD product registrations on our website. Mako and Malathion have received emergency use registration for this year again and previous blog posts for information on products for managing pre-harvest insects including swd on stone fruit.

213,"Texas Crop and Weather Report ? Aug. 7, 2018",,https://www.farms.com/news/texas-crop-and-weather-report-aug-7-2018-137637.aspx,2018-08-08 6:53:10,"By Adam Russell  Wine grape growers around the state experienced challenging conditions, but the 2018 season was expected to produce high-quality fruit, according to Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service experts.  Michael Cook, AgriLife Extension viticulture program specialist, Denton, said harvests are far from complete but the 2018 growing season threw wine grape growers several curveballs that likely led to a 10 percent reduction in yields overall.  Good spring moisture levels started the season off well, and the normal winter temperatures helped abate insect pressure into March and April compared to last year, he said. But then Mother Nature kept growers on their toes the rest of the season.  Growing conditions kept Texas wine grape growers on their toes. Per-acre yields are expected to be lower than previous years due to drought, but growers are expecting good quality fruit in 2018.  Growers in the northern parts of the state experienced spring frost incidents that caused damaging losses, he said. Late frosts were followed by extreme heat and drought.  ?Grapevines awakened as predicted this year and everything looked great, but frost events along the Red River down to Stephenville damaged around 10-20 percent of the crop in those areas,? he said. ?Then Mother Nature turned the heat up, and it?s been challenging due to hot, dry and windy conditions since.?  Cook said temperatures reached 100-plus degrees around June 1 and have not let up.  ?In North and Northeast Texas, we?ve dealt with a fair amount of drought and high temperatures,? he said. ?Central and North Central Texas temperatures have reached 116 degrees and remained above 100 degrees for three to four weeks depending on location, which has elevated vine stress and kept growers on their toes.?  Cook said overall yields will be lower than 2017, which was a bumper year, but that grape quality is expected to be very high.  ?Grapes are smaller, but they are packed with sugar and flavor,? he said. ?The season was a struggle for many, but growers are excited about the potential quality of their grapes.?  Dr. Pierre Helwi, AgriLife Extension viticulture specialist, Lubbock, said smaller grapes typically mean better quality, but there is still concern about rapid-ripening in grapes destined for red wines.  ?Ripening will be very fast because of the high temperatures,? he said. ?Grapes have shown good sugar and acidity levels, but phenolic maturity may be quicker than normal, which could negatively affect quality.?  Helwi said there were few disease and pest issues in the Panhandle and Southern Plains because conditions have been extremely dry. Growers have relied on irrigation to maintain their vines.  Brianna Hoge, AgriLife Extension viticulture specialist, Fredericksburg, said constant irrigation has lowered sugar brix counts in Central Texas grapes. Producers are reporting sugar counts lower than the optimal 21-22 brix for white grapes and 23 or more brix for reds.  ?They?re doing what they can to manage sugar counts, but we?re advising growers they shouldn?t stress the vines further to get their grapes? sugars up,? she said. ?Overall, quality looks good. Exposure to intense sun caused some sunburn to white varieties, but the biggest impact was how drought affected yields as it did in other parts of the state.?  Hoge said some Central Texas growers noted they were expecting 4 tons of grapes per acre but harvested 1 ton per acre. Harvests in Central Texas were also earlier than typical due to rapid ripening.  Cook said AgriLife Extension specialists are focusing now on helping wine grape growers maintain the health of their vines to prevent problems associated with stresses this season to resonate into the 2019 growing season.  Hoge said specialists are also advising thorough cleaning of vineyards to remove possible diseased debris that could become a problem next season. They are also stressing that if the drought continues, growers should be mindful to provide necessary amounts of water throughout dormancy.  ?We?re helping growers keep their vines healthy going into winter and next season,? he said. ?Vine health prior to dormancy will be a big factor in next year?s production, and so we want to help them recover as much as possible.?  AgriLife Extension district reporters compiled the following summaries:  CENTRAL: Drought conditions continued with high temperatures. Very few pastures have any available grazing left, and most stock tanks were very low or dry. Producers were cutting cattle herds. Prices were holding on, but sheep and goat prices dropped a bit. Corn and milo stalks were baled for livestock feed. Fire hazard conditions continued. Livestock were being supplemented. Dryland cotton looked good two weeks ago but was showing heat and drought stress. To this point in the growing season, all dryland crops were 100 percent losses. Most counties reported poor soil moisture and overall rangeland and pasture conditions. Most crop and livestock conditions were fair overall.  ROLLING PLAINS: Hot, dry weather prevailed, though temperatures moderated from the 110-plus degree range experienced in previous weeks. A few southern counties reported receiving 0.5-1.1 inches of spotty rain. Pastures and rangeland were in poor condition. With no moisture, grasses turned dormant and ranchers were forced to increase supplemental feed. Lack of hay for baling and for sale were becoming serious issues. An increased number of cattle were being shipped to market. Irrigated cotton was fair to good, but dryland fields had a very hard start and conditions haven?t improved. Plants were beginning to show signs of lack of moisture, and boll counts were very slim. Native trees were showing signs of drought stress. Forecasts were calling for cooler temperatures and rain.  COASTAL BEND: Hot and dry conditions continued, with some scattered showers reported in a few areas. Corn and sorghum harvests continued, and rice harvest began. Below-average yields were reported so far. Cotton in the southern end of the district was being harvested. Cotton fields in other areas looked good, and bolls were starting to open up with some defoliation applications being made. The pecan crop looked good, but orchards needed some heavy rainfall as trees entered kernel development. Pasture conditions were beginning to deteriorate, and supplemental feeding began in some areas. Hay baling was in full swing with an average crop. Livestock remained in fair condition, although flies have become a nuisance.  EAST: Drought conditions and growing fire danger continued despite scattered showers throughout the district. Panola County reported one small area of the county received 6 inches of rain in a half hour, but the majority of areas only received 0.25-1 inch of rainfall. Cherokee County producers were forced to move livestock due to ponds and creeks going dry. Marion and Harrison county producers were concerned about declining stock and pond water. Lack of hay continued across the district causing Gregg and Marion county producers to feed hay. Sabine County reported continued high production levels of forage and hay. Pasture and rangeland conditions were good in Sabine County, fair in San Augustine, Gregg and Shelby counties and all other counties reported poor to very poor conditions. Some Marion County producers started preparations for fall gardens. Subsoil conditions were reported to be adequate in Sabine, Jasper, San Augustine and Gregg counties, while all other counties reported short to very short conditions. Topsoil conditions were adequate in Sabine, Jasper and San Augustine counties, and all other counties reported short to very short conditions. Producers began culling cattle in Cherokee and Gregg counties. Cattle market numbers in Houston and Shelby counties remained steady, and calf prices were up per hundredweight in Houston County. Armyworm infestations were devastating forages in Cherokee and Sabine counties. Wild pigs continued to cause difficulties in Shelby County.  SOUTH PLAINS: Subsoil and topsoil moisture levels remained adequate to short. Lack of rain, high temperatures and wind continued to dry out already parched land. Producers continued to supplement with irrigation. Sorghum, cotton, peanuts and corn continued to mature. Producers were conducting weed and pest management. Some cotton was plowed up after insurance adjustments. Pastures and rangeland needed moisture. Many cattle producers were shipping herds due to drought conditions and declining tank water. Cattle were in good condition.  PANHANDLE: Conditions were warm and windy with average temperatures. Some moisture was received. A good, general soaking rain was needed throughout the district. Soil moisture levels continued to be short to very short. Armstrong County received some rain but was still experiencing wildfires. Hall County drought conditions continued with spotty rains in some areas. Rangeland and pastures were still in very good condition in some areas, and cattle were performing well. Cattle body conditions and pastures continued to decline in other areas. Irrigated crops looked good. Moore County received scattered showers but little accumulation. Ochiltree County wheat pre-plant activity continued. Some late-season irrigation was provided for corn and cotton. Many cotton fields were nearing cut out. Insect scouting and control continued in all crops.  NORTH: A cold front brought cooler temperatures but very little rain. Daytime temperatures fell to the upper 90s, and nighttime temperatures ranged in the mid- to upper-60s. The cooler weather helped, but more rain was needed. Crops, pastures and hay fields were showing signs of stress, and stock ponds were receding. Topsoil and subsoil moisture levels were mostly short, with some counties reporting very short. Corn was 40-45 percent harvested. Cotton and soybean fields were showing stress. Soybeans and corn stalks were being harvested for forage. Cattle looked good considering the tough conditions and low-quality forage they were eating. Hay production was about 30 percent of normal. Pastures looked green but, were not growing. Some ranchers were considering early weaning and/or culling lower producing or open cows.

214,"Trade Tariffs Initiate Soybean Market Shift, Cause Concern",,https://www.farms.com/news/trade-tariffs-initiate-soybean-market-shift-cause-concern-137701.aspx,2018-08-10 4:08:50,"By Justin Miller  As Farm Bill discussions continue in Washington, D.C., producers wait for the direction a new bill will bring to the agricultural sector. Without a completed Farm Bill, producers are operating on the previous bill?s prices and provisions. The trade tariffs imposed on many U.S. agricultural products have raised concerns about the future of production agriculture.  Max Runge, an Alabama Cooperative Extension System agricultural economics specialist, said there is never an opportune time for trade disputes, but the timing is especially bad, as farm income is nearly half of what it was five years ago.  Trade Tariffs  In early July, the U.S. imposed a 25 percent tariff on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods imported into the country. In retaliation, China made good on a previous threat to implement tariffs on U.S. items, including soybeans and other agricultural products. Soybeans are one of Alabama?s most commonly grown row crops, therefore, these tariffs have potential to hurt Alabama producers.  The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) June crop acreage report indicates a one percent drop in soybean acreage planted in the U.S. The 2018 estimates show 89.1 million planted acres. down from 89.9 million acres the previous year. Compared to 2017, planted acreage is lower or the same in 14 of the 31 states that participated in the estimate. The U.S. currently crushes nearly half of the soybeans produced and exports the other half.  This is only the second time soybean planting has exceeded corn acreage in the U.S. Alabama soybean acreage was up three percent over 2017, and is second in row crop acres behind cotton.  ?With the increased duties imposed by China, they will likely continue to buy U.S. soybeans but they will buy less of them,? Runge said. ?Brazil and other soybean producing countries will be the beneficiary of an increased cost of U.S.-grown soybeans. Brazil and other countries could purchase some U.S. soybeans at discounted prices.?  Soybean Prices and Market  Runge said the large supply of soybeans and the trade tariffs have lowered soybean prices.  ?The threat of a trade war mixed with the record production of soybeans and the prediction for another large soybean crop, has pulled the soybean price down,? Runge said. ?If there are producers who haven?t priced 2018 soybeans, my advice is to wait and see. Hopefully, trade negations with China, Canada and Mexico will be settled sooner rather than later.?  Runge said July 7 was an interesting day for the soybean market. After implementation of the 25 percent tariff, the market closed on November soybeans with their largest price increase of 2018. Soybeans closed with a $.3875 increase. Even with the increase, November soybeans fell nearly $2 per bushel between the last week of May and the first week in July.  Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, announced a $12 billion agricultural trade package geared toward providing relief for farmers. Farmers can expect more details next month.  More Information  Increased stress levels from trade issues, as well as the usual occupational risks, are taking a toll on farmers. With continued pressure on farm income, Farm Bill finalization is important to help producers as they plan for the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
215,U.S. Poultry Gains New Market Access in Morocco,,https://www.farms.com/news/u-s-poultry-gains-new-market-access-in-morocco-137603.aspx,2018-08-07 7:36:19,"U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced today that the government of Morocco has agreed to allow commercial imports of U.S. poultry meat and products into Morocco for the first time.  ?The Trump Administration continues to prioritize the opening of new markets for U.S. agricultural products. This new access to the Moroccan market is an important step in ensuring that American farmers and ranchers can continue to expand their exports,? said Ambassador Lighthizer. ?I welcome Morocco?s agreement to allow imports of U.S. poultry meat and products and the economic opportunities that will be afforded to U.S. producers.?  ?Opening new markets for American poultry and other agricultural products is a top priority. I am convinced that when the Moroccan people get a taste of U.S. poultry, they re going to want more of it,? said Secretary Perdue. ?The products that will be imported into Morocco are safe, wholesome, and very delicious. This is also a good harbinger of the kind of relationship that can be developed. We hope there are other things we can cooperate on as USDA works to expand markets around the globe.?  The United States is the world?s second largest poultry exporter, with global sales of poultry meat and products of $4.3 billion last year. In May 2018, U.S. exports of agricultural products exceeded $12 billion (latest data available). Initial estimates indicate that Morocco would be a $10 million market, with additional growth over time. Morocco had prohibited imports of U.S. poultry. Officials from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the U.S. Department of Agriculture worked with the Moroccan government to provide assurances on the safety of U.S. poultry.

Horticulture  With input from Ontario?s Berry Consultants  Click here for a pdf: Using SINBAR(R) in Strawberries 2018  SINBAR(80 WDG) can be used multiple times a year in strawberries at varying rates. If you have just planted your strawberries you can use SINBAR at three different times within that year. If you have strawberries in the harvesting year you can use SINBAR a maximum of two applications per year following rototilling or renovation. These application timings are broken down in the chart below.  It is very important to wash SINBAR off the plants with rain or irrigation immediately following application to avoid injury (varieties have varying degrees of sensitivity). If SINBAR is not washed off avoid applying when temperatures are above 25oC (77oF).  Do NOT replant treated areas to any crop within 2 years after the last application as injury to subsequent crops may occur. To reduce replanting injury to subsequent crops, cultivate or plough soil thoroughly and conduct a field bioassay.

219,WASDE: U.S. The Total Meat Production Raised From Last Month,,https://www.farms.com/news/wasde-u-s-the-total-meat-production-raised-from-last-month-137730.aspx,2018-08-10 14:17:59,"LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY: The forecast for total meat production in 2018 is raised from last month as increases in broiler production more than offset declines in beef, pork, and turkey production. Second-quarter broiler production is raised on June production data, while third-quarter production is raised on hatchery data and expected growth in bird weights. The decline in beef production largely reflects a slower pace of marketings in the third quarter. Cow slaughter is raised, but recent carcass weight data and a larger proportion of cows in the slaughter mix led to a reduction in expected carcass weights during the second half of the year. Pork production is reduced on a slower expected pace of slaughter during the last half of the year. Forecast turkey production is reduced slightly from the previous month on June production data. Egg production is increased on second-quarter production data. For 2019, the pork production forecast is raised from the previous month on higher expected hog slaughter in the first part of the year and heavier carcass weights. The beef production forecast is raised on heavier carcass weights in 2019. Broiler production is also raised for 2019 on lower forecast feed prices. Annual turkey and egg production forecasts for 2019 are unchanged from the previous month.  For 2018, second-quarter beef imports are reduced on June trade data. the forecasts for the outlying quarters and into 2019 are unchanged. Beef export forecasts are raised for both 2018 and 2019 on expectations of continued strong global demand. Second-quarter pork imports for 2018 are lowered slightly on recent trade data, but the forecasts for the outlying quarters and into 2019 are unchanged. The second-quarter pork export forecast is adjusted for June data. the forecast for the remainder of 2018 and into 2019 is reduced slightly on expected competition in several markets. Broiler and turkey export forecasts are reduced for both 2018 and 2019 on weaker-than-expected demand.  Cattle and turkey price forecasts are unchanged at the midpoint for 2018 and 2019. Hog and broiler price forecasts are lowered for 2018 and 2019. The egg price forecast for 2018 is raised on recent price strength. no changes are made to the 2019 egg price forecasts. The milk production forecast for 2018 is unchanged from last month. The milk production forecast for 2019 is raised from the previous month on slightly higher cow numbers and increased milk per cow. For 2018, fat basis exports are raised from the previous month on higher sales of butter and other fat-containing products. The fat basis import forecast is also raised on higher expected imports of butterfat products. The skim-solids basis export forecast for 2018 is lowered on weaker sales of nonfat dry milk (NDM) and the imposition of tariffs by  China on lactose and other dairy products. The import forecast is unchanged. For 2019, the fat basis import and export forecasts are unchanged from the previous month. Skim-solids basis exports are lowered on expected continued weak sales of lactose. The skim-solids import forecast for 2019 is reduced from the previous month on lower expected imports of milk protein concentrates.  For 2018, cheese, butter, NDM and whey price forecasts are raised for 2018. Prices for cheese, NDM and whey are also raised for 2019 as demand strength is expected to carry into next year. However, the 2019 butter price forecast remains unchanged from the previous month. The 2018 Class III and Class IV price forecasts are raised from the previous month to reflect the higher dairy product price forecasts. For 2019, Class III price forecast is raised on higher forecast cheese and whey prices. The Class IV price forecast is raised on the stronger forecast NDM price. The all milk price is raised to $16.10 to $16.30 per cwt for 2018, and is raised to $16.45 to $17.45 per cwt for 2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
220,Weaning Diet Options,,https://www.farms.com/news/weaning-diet-options-137569.aspx,2018-08-06 6:10:39,"By Justin Sexton  Spring calving herds, depending on rainfall and temperatures, may be weeks or months away from weaning. For many operations, that will bring the challenge of feeding weaned calves for a short transition period. That?s when nutrition is critical to end-product quality, because it influences both marbling development and calf health, which in turn also affects later quality grade. You may find local forages in short supply if your herd has had to deal with hot, dry weather this summer. One of the few ?opportunities? that presents is evaluating alternative forage feeding strategies that may otherwise go untried.  You have to weigh the possible benefits as well as cost for any forage. Although many consider forage relatively inexpensive on a per-pound basis, it?s virtually always the most expensive per unit of gain when compared to grains. Still, the benefits to gut health and rumen buffering keep forages included in weaning and receiving diets. To improve on averages, a good alternative should improve feed efficiency while maintaining those gut health benefits.  Independent of dietary requirements, your weaning forage model needs to fit within the ranch management program. To keep it simple, many prefer offering their ranch-weaned calves supplements and all the hay they want. The challenge with that is, calves may eat the hay independent of supplement, potentially increasing the group?s range of energy intake. Free-choice hay at weaning usually signals a limited ability to either process or mix forages into a weaning diet.  Recent work from Mariah Woolsoncroft and coworkers at Oklahoma State University evaluated a combination of cottonseed hulls and soybean hulls as a forage source for receiving weaned calves. It could be mixed and delivered as a complete diet, minimizing traditional forage needs while addressing the operational challenges of storing and mixing. The 56-day experiment compared two wet-corn-gluten-based receiving diets, one with 30% prairie hay and the other having replaced hay with 15% of the total as cottonseed hulls and 15% soybean hulls.  There were no differences in performance on the diets as all calves gained more than 4 pounds (lb.) a day. Feed intake was 1.8 lb./day lower, however, for calves fed the alternative diet with hulls, resulting in improved feed efficiency. Manure consistency and pH was measured to assess gut health. Calves fed the alternative forage combination had slightly looser manure due to smaller forage particle size, but only slight pH differences.  Manure consistency is an interesting metric of gut health. Loose manure could contribute to dehydration, while dry and firm manure indicates poor diet digestibility. The slight manure differences in this experiment are more likely due to improved digestibility as indicated by comparable gain with less feed intake, rather than reduced gut health.  Previous research suggests feeding higher concentrate receiving diets can improve cattle performance and efficiency, at the cost of increased respiratory treatment rates but often offset by the performance boost. In those historic experiments, the cost to carcass quality due to greater treatment rates were not evaluated, nor were the benefits of greater energy intake earlier in the feeding period. That gap could launch an interesting experiment down the road, perhaps. In this experiment, initial and total respiratory treatment rates did not differ based on forage source.  The Oklahoma State experiment did not report the calves through harvest, but performance and health data during receiving suggests we could expect comparable carcass quality when substituting a mix of cottonseed hulls and soybean hulls for forage in a weaning ration.

222,What?s a Grazier to Do in August?,,https://www.farms.com/news/what-s-a-grazier-to-do-in-august-137752.aspx,2018-08-13 7:20:42,"By Victor Shelton    August often seems to arrive too early and speeds by way too fast. Mentally to me, August 1st starts the countdown to the first frosty morning. That time frame, depending on where you are in Indiana, is generally 60-75 days. There is a lot to do in that time frame.    My first consideration is staging forages. I hope that you are constantly thinking ahead, planning the next move and knowing where, what, and how much forage is available. It?s time to also start thinking about stockpiling forages for fall and winter use.    What fields are going to be stockpiled this year? They probably need to change from year to year, just like the first field grazed in the spring. Are they in the appropriate stage of growth? To have a quality stockpile, it needs to be pretty vegetative right now. Fields that have not been grazed much or at all this year could be stockpiled, but quality, production and efficiency take a hit. I overlook those factors to a degree if I?m wanting to build and/or improve soil organic matter or soil health, but there is some cost to this procrastination. I say that somewhat tongue in cheek because it is still probably better to graze it if you have it. It certainly is better than baling it at that point because it won?t make quality hay. If the cows are going to pick through it, let them eat the best and trample the rest. There is no reason in moving those nutrients around.    Back to stockpiling. If you are lucky enough to catch some of these spotty rains, your forage is growing well and you have good nutrient presence through application, nutrient cycling and legumes, then you probably don?t have to do too much to prepare for stockpile besides keeping the gate shut. Occasionally a cleanup, even-out type clipping is in order after the last grazing. Like I mentioned last month, that should require a good reason to justify. Occasionally a small application of nitrogen is in order as long as moisture is present. I prefer to maintain adequate amounts of legumes for nitrogen. This generally means at least 30% legumes by dry weight. Where lacking legumes, the addtion of 30-60 pounds of nitrogen can certainly boost yield and quality of the stockpile, but it also creates some more competition for existing legumes.    My next thought is the addition of any annuals for this fall. Annuals planted after corn or soybeans can help improve the soil for the next crop and provide numerous other benefits, but they can also provide some quality forage for grazing. Every day that you are grazing annuals or crop residue or combination of the two in late summer or early fall, the more rest that is being provided to pastures, allowing more potential growth and grazing days and less hay days. Moisture is a factor in getting a good forage yield in September. Minimizing soil disturbance to plant these annuals will help reduce additional moisture loss. Plant as early as possible to maximize growing days. This often means planning ahead and possibly going with shorter season varieties.    My favorite mix is spring oats, turnips or radish and cereal rye. The oats and brassica come on early and with sufficient moisture can produce a lot of quality forage. The cereal rye remains fairly quiet in the background until spring and then it kicks in providing the opportunity for some spring grazing or just prime cover to no-till into.    I?ll try and remember to discuss it more in September, but it?s never too early to start figuring out how many potential grazing days might be left and also the amount of stored feed. I?d rather know now that I?m low on forage for the livestock I have, than to find out in the middle of the winter!    Hay is somewhat limited this year. This makes some people think that they need to bale everything possible. We should think twice about this. First ask yourself if it can be grazed. Quite a bit of forage is rolled up and fed when it could have been grazed instead. There are a lot of wheels turning out there. Next ask yourself if it is practical to bale hay if you have to feed hay at the same time. It happens. If a wheel is turning, we are spending money. Like I?ve said before, cows (sheep, goats, horses, etc.) have four feet, are 4-wheel drive and harvest forage and spread manure at the same time. We need to let them do as much work as we can for us. They should be working for us, not us working for them.    There is also a lot of hay produced from very limited volumes. In other words, there isn?t much out there to cut, but we cut it anyway. Put a pencil to those bales. I know hay may be scarce in some areas, but there is a somewhat fixed cost for mowing, raking, and to a degree, baling. The lower the yield, the higher the cost per bale. Those low yielding, last minute cuttings would probably be best grazed instead. Look at it as an opportunity to graze it or stockpile it. It is, for the most part, just standing ?hay.? It is a lot more efficient to harvest it by grazing, than by baling.    The dairy industry is certainly on my mind. I?m seeing several herds being sold and multi-generational dairies not knowing what the future holds. Dairy producers dedicate 365 days a year to their passion, their lifestyle, and put in grueling hours to accomplish what most people take for granted. The dairy producers I know are some of the most dedicated, hardworking individuals that you would ever meet. Take some time today to support the ones that are left, and give them a pat on the back.    I?ll end today on a solemn note. The cattle and grazing world lost a good comrade on July 25th. Gearld Fry, a good friend of mine, passed away after a long battle with cancer. Gearld was a leader in selecting cattle for management in a natural, totally grass-based environment. He had a lifetime of experience that not only was very practical, but also seasoned by a ton of observation. Gearld often referred to an old French book written by M. Francis Guenon in the mid 1800?s. Guenon spent years figuring out dairy cow indicators of production, especially butter fat, and important fertilty traits. Gearld keyed in on these and brought them to light in our present time frame. Gearld also advocated linear measurement and other tools for cattle improvement. He not only touched thousands of people internationally, but he left a special legacy everywhere he stepped. I appreciate knowing him and spending time with him. Rest in peace Gearld, in greener pastures.

224,Who Eats Alberta Beef?,,https://www.farms.com/news/who-eats-alberta-beef-137615.aspx,2018-08-07 19:25:39,"Demand for Alberta beef remains strong, both domestically and internationally. Jason Wood, provincial livestock market analyst with Alberta Agriculture and Forestry (AF), breaks down the numbers from the recently released Agriculture Facts 2018.  Estimated Alberta beef production was 732,051 tonnes in 2017, up five per cent from 2016. ?Of that,? says Wood, ?Albertans consumed 16 per cent, or 117,128 tonnes. Canadians ? outside of Alberta ? consumed 51.3 per cent, or 375,542 tonnes. Alberta exported 24.3 per cent, or 177,888 tonnes to the U.S., while 8.4 per cent, or 61,492 tonnes, was exported to other countries.?  The domestic demand for beef is strong in Canada. Explains Wood, ?Comparing changes in beef consumption and price shows that consumption decreased about 8.4 per cent between 2013 and 2017 while the indexed price of beef rose 19.5 per cent during that same period. As well, average per capita beef consumption was 25.9 kilograms in 2017, up marginally from the previous year.?  Wood adds that the average of various retail beef product prices, as reported to Statistics Canada, shows that prices have remained relatively flat, averaging $19.30 per kg in the first five months of 2018. ?Based on this average, retail beef prices are down five per cent from highs in 2016 but remain eight per cent higher than the five year average.?  ?By comparison, an average of various retail pork and chicken products shows that prices have shown more stability than beef,? says Wood. ?The average retail pork price for 2018 is $12.77 per kg, on par with 2017. That is down three per cent from the high in 2016 and five per cent higher than the five year average.?  The average retail chicken price in 2018 is $7.40 per kg, up two per cent from 2017, but down 1.6 per cent from 2016 and 1.6 per cent above the five year average. ?While domestic prices have fluctuated, they have shown more stability compared to global price indices for red meats and poultry,? notes Wood.
